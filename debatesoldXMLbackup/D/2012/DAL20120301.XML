      <P>The European Central Bank pumped an extra &euro;529 billion into the EU financial system yesterday.  That brings the total amount that has been invested in the three-year programme to more than &euro;1 trillion.  Up to 800 banks across Europe have taken advantage of the programme.  At a macro level, this initiative of the ECB has been described as a game-changer.  In reality, it has not filtered down to the real economy.  Businesses up and down the country are finding it practically impossible to access loans or proper credit facilities to enable them to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  The absence of credit is causing businesses to reduce their workforces.  In some instances, they have to close down altogether as a consequence of the failure to get credit.</P>
      <P>Two days ago, the Taoiseach told the House that the Government intends to meet the banks &ldquo;in a couple of months&rdquo; to deal with this problem.  According to the Credit Review Office, credit targets are being met.  Its calculations are based on credit approvals, rather than actual credit drawdowns, and take account of the restructuring of existing loans, as opposed to the provision of new credit facilities.  Even though bank deposits are stabilising and the banks are getting access to critical finance from the ECB, the banks are being far too rigid and inflexible.  Every Deputy in the House can cite examples of small businesses that are unable to access credit.  Many companies are in dire trouble as a result of the tightening of credit across the country.  In light of this critical problem &mdash; not to mention the pressure on mortgages &mdash; is it any wonder that the domestic economy is flagging?  What does the Government intend to do to alleviate the shortage of credit?  In particular, what will it do to get the banks operating properly in the interests of small and medium enterprises and the broader interests of the economy as a whole?</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il here this morning.  Like Deputy Martin, I welcome the provision yesterday of &euro;529 billion by the European Central Bank for the European economy.  As the Deputy said, those funds are in addition to the &euro;450 billion that was provided by the ECB before Christmas and bring to almost &euro;1 trillion the total amount of money the ECB has committed over recent months.  It was certainly the Government&rsquo;s view that funding should be committed to the European economy in order to support it.  That was something we had been seeking for some time.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important for those funds to work their way right into the economy.</P>
      <Col N="610" />
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have met the banks to discuss three issues.  We met representatives of each of the groups &mdash; Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland and AIB &mdash; just over a week ago.  The first of the three issues we discussed was the need to lend to small and medium sized businesses, in particular, to ensure credit is available to businesses to allow them to support existing jobs and create new ones.  We also discussed how the banks can co-operate with all aspects of the Government&rsquo;s employment creation strategy, particularly the action plan on jobs.  The third matter we discussed was the issue of mortgage lending and mortgage arrears.  In addition, we are arranging for discussions to take place with businesses and banks at local and regional level.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has undertaken a series of regional meetings that will bring these discussions right down to ground level.  I understand that successful meetings took place in Cork and Waterford in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to engage with the banks.  The meetings that were mentioned by the Taoiseach earlier this week are part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with the banks.  Some of that engagement is happening on an ongoing basis at official level and some of it is happening at a political level.  The Taoiseach and I are having direct meetings with the banks and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will also meet them.  This is part of an engagement by Government with the banks to ensure that credit is provided for small and medium-sized businesses and that there is support for the Government&rsquo;s strategy, which is set out in the action plan on jobs, in order to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s engagement with the banks is wholly ineffectual.  The bottom line is that companies are not getting access to credit and small businesses throughout the country are complaining.  We have all been given examples on a weekly basis of tightening credit, of cash flow being cut off, of a very rigid and inflexible approach being taken towards people who want to protect jobs or who want to create new jobs.  The banks are looking after themselves and no one else.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste talks about engagement and regional meetings, yet we have had regional meetings for two to three years now and we have had all this debate.  People do not want any more discussion nor do they want any more timid engagement.  They want action.  They want the funding that is being put into the banks by the State and the taxpayers and the massive amounts of money that has been provided by the European Central Bank to be filtered down into the real economy, onto the high street and the factory floor but this is not happening.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach acknowledged two days ago that many companies will not go through the Credit Review Office for fear of retribution, for fear that they will be punished by the banks if they dare complain that they are not getting fair treatment or fair access.  We cannot wait for months, we cannot have another series of regional meetings where people talk politely in halls or in meeting rooms about how nice it would be to have access to credit.  This is choking the economy and it is choking the sector that creates most jobs, up to 700,000 and 800,000 at the peak of the boom.  It is the sector that will have to be the engine for growth and job creation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputy Martin that unlike the previous Government, this Government is having discussions with the banks about lending to small and medium-sized businesses.  In his opening question, Deputy Martin wanted to know what the Government planned to do to discuss the issue of the provision of credit to small and medium-sized businesses through the banks.  The Government has already been in talks with the banks about this issue.</P>

      <P>Deputy Martin has raised an issue which the Government has well under control.  We have published the action plan for jobs, we have set out the kind of funds that will be established in order to provide credit and start-up capital and to help business to create jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach repeatedly tell us that they wish to restore Irish sovereignty.  However, they do not seem to be having very much success.  They propose a referendum to give away even more control over Ireland&rsquo;s economic affairs while the German Parliament discusses the Irish budgetary situation when Members of this House and the public are kept in the dark.  For a second time, the finance committee of the Bundestag, has discussed sensitive documents relating to the austerity programme of the troika &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s external partners &mdash; before the Irish public and Members of this House or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, have even seen them.  This is a ludicrous situation in which German parliamentarians discuss the economic situation in Ireland while we in Ireland are kept in the dark.</P>
      <Col N="612" />
      <P>The substance of these documents, it seems, is also deeply troubling.  The Commission&rsquo;s report suggests that the Irish State may require a mini budget in 2012.  The European Commission appears to be recommending greater cuts and tax hikes.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have repeatedly warned that unless there is a change in the direction of Government policy, Ireland may not meet the troika targets and a mini budget may be necessary.  If these reports are true, then it seems our fears will have been confirmed.</P>
      <P>I understand the report also suggests that the Commission demanded a revised assets sale programme from the Government in December.  Is this how &euro;2 billion of a fire sale became &euro;3 billion?  Was the T&aacute;naiste aware that the finance committee of the Bundestag would be discussing these documents?  Does he propose to publish them?  Is the State facing a mini budget in 2012?  Did the Government cave in to a Commission demand for more State assets to be sold?  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that it is in fact Frankfurt&rsquo;s way rather than Labour&rsquo;s way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The document to which Deputy McDonald referred states a number of things.  It is a staff document, as I understand, prepared by some staff in the European Commission and was leaked.  However, it has a number of positive observations about this country.  It says that the Irish economy is expected to have returned to growth in 2011.  It states that our general Government deficit is estimated to have been well below the programme targets and that the recapitalisation of the domestic banks has been substantially completed.  It observes that reflecting the strong performance under the programme, financial market confidence in Ireland has continued to improve.  This document should be put in perspective, confirming as it does what the  Government has been saying for some time, that this country&rsquo;s economy is recovering and it will recover under this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The document will be published today.  I hate to disappoint the Deputy but a mini budget will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy at the way in which this document was handled and how it was leaked.  The matter has been raised this morning with both the German finance ministry and with the European Commission.  I intend to pursue the issue.  I will discuss it with our ambassador in Berlin and I will ensure that the way in which this document was handled is not repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste may wish to try to trivialise matters when they are raised in this session.  He may be amused at his own jokes &mdash; his backbenchers clearly are &mdash; but I hazard a guess that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett">

      <P>Sorry, could we get on with a question please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;people who are suffering from the results of his austerity will not find this a bit funny.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear he will pursue this matter again.  He told us this the last time.  Does he remember the last time the Bundestag finance committee discussed the economic circumstances of this State at length?  On that occasion, he also told us he would pursue the matter vigorously.  If there was ever an example of his ineffectiveness and his failure, it surely resides in the fact that we now have episode two of exactly the same scenario.  Maybe that is not surprising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we could have a question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he is clearly very happy that Germany, perhaps France, the Commission and outside agencies and institutions would have a first view, a first opinion and a final decision-making capacity in respect of the economic governance of this State.  His colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;thinks the referendum is still undemocratic.  He obviously would prefer the German parliamentarians to take decisions for us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, could I have your question please?  You are over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>He indicated that he has this document.  Will he tell us how long he has had it?  How was it that parliamentarians in Germany saw and debated it before any Member of this House?  Will he give a serious answer rather than a trivial one because that would be extremely helpful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I never give trivial answers.  I do not trivialise what has happened to our economy or the difficulties people have in coping with the consequences of what has happened to it, including the loss of jobs.  There are people in Cork this morning, for example, who are being asked for voluntary redundancies.  I am acutely aware of that, as is the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste should do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why our programme and strategy is to work our way to economic recovery.  That cannot be done by some kind of abracadabra economics which Deputy McDonald seems to advocate from time to time.  It must be done consistently and over a period of time.</P>
      <Col N="614" />
      <P>She talks about people external to this country.  The reality, given the state of the economy we inherited this time last year, was that nobody in the financial markets would lend to this country and we had become reliant on finance from external people &mdash; the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Since last year we have worked consistently to stabilise the economic situation, to get growth back into the Irish economy for the first time in four years, to pursue a trade and investment strategy in order to get jobs into this country and to pursue a jobs strategy which is set out in our action plan for jobs and in Pathways to Work.</P>
      <P>There is no easy solution or quick fix to the Irish economy.  The only solution to the Irish economy is to work our way out of the programme in which we found ourselves, which is how we will get back our economic sovereignty, and to create jobs and growth in our economy and in the European economy.  That is what will work and is what the Government is concentrating on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has missed the point.  The point about these embarrassing leaks which came from the Bundestag today is that the impression, and maybe the rightful impression, remains that our economic policy and the policy of austerity is dictated, decided and revealed elsewhere.  It did not come here first.  That is the problem.  We need an assurance today that this will not happen again.  It is no use getting officials to talk to each other on the telephone.</P>
      <P>It will not help the selling of the referendum either if this impression continues to be given by the Bundestag.  What will help the selling of the referendum by the Government is if the Taoiseach, who is in a unique position in Brussels today, says this referendum is an advantage to us and let us turn it into a positive.  The whole Cabinet was shell-shocked by the fact there was to be a referendum but it can be turned into a positive because it is a wild card in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pocket when he goes to Europe today.</P>
      <P>He should go there and say the Irish people will respond better to a referendum if there are no more leaks from the Bundestag and if the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes come into the equation.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste say, I think on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the other night, that the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes were not linked to the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>They are and they are very strongly linked to the riddle of austerity which is being imposed on this country.</P>
      <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste assure this House that he will embark on a diplomatic offensive to tell those 27 countries that the Irish people would look much more benignly on this referendum, which they want to see passed, if they looked more benignly on our debt and were prepared to give us a credit write-off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, I do not know whether Deputy Ross is for or against the referendum.  He came in here when we announced we were holding it and I think he told us he was <Col N="615" />going to oppose it.  Now he seems to be suggesting that he might support it in certain circumstances.  Let me tell Deputy Ross something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore">
      <NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how he sees Irish diplomacy working but I will tell him how I see it working.  We will not trade the constitutional rights of the Irish people with anybody or for anything.  The referendum we will have is one for the Irish people to decide whether they want to ratify the treaty concluded on 30 January.</P>
      <P>Treaty or no treaty, we will continue the discussions we had already begun with the troika in regard to the re-engineering of the promissory notes which are very onerous on the Irish people and on the Irish taxpayer.  We had already commenced work on that and work is taking place with the troika which we hope will produce a positive result for Ireland.  We are not linking it to any treaty.  We have been engaged in that for some time and we will continue with that engagement.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The treaty which we believe is required in order to ensure stability in the eurozone, so there will be investment in Europe and Ireland to create jobs, is something we will put to the people on its own merits.  We have no intention of engaging in any kind of a trade-off of the constitutional rights of the Irish people to decide on that treaty in their own time and based on their own judgment with anybody or for anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I now understand why the T&aacute;naiste did not make the Minister for Social Protection the Minister for Finance because she said in an interview today with the<i> Financial Times</i> that the European Union should cut the cost of Ireland&rsquo;s bailout to help it pass the eurozone fiscal pact in a high stakes referendum.  If that is not linking one with the other, I do not know what is.  She went on to endorse that in stronger terms in that interview.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Let us get this straight.  Do the Labour Party and the Government not understand the rightful perception among the people that the austerity, which is being imposed in this fiscal compact, is linked to the fact that it is also imposed because of the promissory notes? If we can get money off and get a debt write-off on the promissory notes, we will also have less austerity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the Bill is to implement the convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters which was signed at Lugano on 30 October 2007.  This convention is commonly referred to as the 2007 Lugano convention.  The Bill is technical in character and is mainly an exercise in updating and modernising existing arrangements.  I feel I can safely say that it is completely devoid of controversy.</P>
      <P>The 2007 convention supersedes an earlier convention of the same name which was concluded in 1988 and which has been in force in this jurisdiction since 1993.  It involves the member states of the European Union and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, which latter states are members of the European Free Trade Association or EFTA.  The 2007 convention was concluded by the European Community in May 2009 as the Community has exclusive competence for its conclusion.  It has since been ratified by all of the relevant EFTA countries.  Special arrangements apply to Denmark in the area of judicial co-operation in civil matters.  The convention has also been ratified by that country in its own right.  A similar ratification requirement does not arise in regard to Ireland or any of the other member states.</P>
      <P>Within the EU, matters to do with jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters are governed by a council regulation which is commonly referred to as Brussels I.  This regulation replaced a 1968 convention which dealt with the same subject matter.  There has always been a concern to foster the relationship between the EU and the EFTA countries of Iceland, Switzerland and Norway.</P>
      <P>In the judgments area, this was reflected in the fact that the original Brussels convention was paralleled by a subsequent Lugano convention.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the Brussels 1 regulation should, in turn, be paralleled by a new Lugano convention, which is the subject matter of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Thus, the primary purpose of the new convention is to ensure that the same regime will apply for the recognition and enforcement of judgments moving between these EFTA countries and the Union as at present prevails within the Union for judgments coming from the member states.  The 2007 convention replicates the Brussels 1 regulation in all essential elements and this Bill largely replicates the content of the statutory instrument which was used to give full effect to that regulation, which has been in operation since March 2002.</P>
      <Col N="621" />
      <P>A key objective of the 2007 convention, and the instruments which relate to it, is to streamline the procedure for enabling judgments given in one participating state to be recognised and enforced in each of the other participating states.  Linking with this objective is the establishment of jurisdictional rules which determine the courts which are competent to rule on an action.  There is a very simple concept which lies at the heart of the 2007 convention, the Brussels 1 regulation and of the earlier conventions.  In essence, it is the creation of a legal space among kindred countries which facilitates the provision of speedy and informal procedures which allow judgments in one participating state to be enforced in another participating state.</P>
      <P>The recognition and enforcement regime provided by the Brussels 1 and Lugano instruments has the capacity to contribute significantly towards the growth of international trade and investment.  A feature of economic development in recent years has been the globalisation of products and markets.  Increased international competition and the growth in telecommunications and other technologies mean that measures providing for jurisdiction and enforcement across national boundaries have become more necessary.  There is an ever-growing requirement that international contracts can be adjudicated upon easily before the courts of another country and that judgments given on foot of such adjudication can be enforced readily in other jurisdictions.  In this context, a system which guarantees the virtually automatic enforcement of foreign judgments is an important and practical tool for anyone doing business across national boundaries.  On the other hand, costs, delay and vexatious use of judicial proceedings do not do anything to support effective market conditions.</P>
      <P>The progressive elimination of barriers to trade means that now, more than ever, predictability and certainty are vital in the area of business and commercial relationships within Europe and beyond.  Both individuals and corporate entities need to be sure that they can readily enforce contracts and secure enforcement of judgments for what can, in some cases, be extremely large sums of money.  Such measures have the twin effects of both protecting existing trade and encouraging new trade.</P>
      <P>The Brussels 1 and Lugano regimes extend to 30 countries.  By any standards, this represents substantial coverage in terms of economic markets.  However, there is clearly scope for a more global approach which will bring in additional countries including those with which we have close ties, such as the United States, Canada and Australia.  Thus, it is to be welcomed that the Hague Conference on Private International Law has adopted a convention on choice of court agreements.  That convention aims to ensure that such agreements, when they involve the parties to commercial transactions, can be upheld on a global basis.  The likelihood is that this convention will be concluded by the European Union at some time in the future.  Even more to be welcomed is the possibility that a more ambitious project will be undertaken within the framework of the Hague conference which will involve the development of a worldwide convention providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial areas.  This testifies to the fact that there is great potential for expansion and development in the sphere of judicial co-operation in Europe and beyond.</P>
      <P>Our own trading links with the EFTA states covered by the Lugano convention are solid.  Switzerland is a key market for Irish merchandise exports.  Such exports reached over &euro;3.5 billion in 2010, the last year for which figures are available, and mostly consisted of medical, pharmaceutical and chemical products.  Our merchandise imports from that country are worth approximately &euro;0.85 billion annually.  Services exports to Switzerland are also very significant, having reached an annual total of &euro;1.8 billion in 2010.  Services imports for the same year totalled &euro;1.6 billion.  Deputies may be surprised to realise that our trade engagements with Switzerland are running at over &euro;7.5 billion per annum on average.  It is also worth noting that Switzerland is a major source of foreign direct investment in Ireland.</P>
      <Col N="622" />
      <P>Norway is a very significant supplier of oil to the Irish market, to the value of about &euro;1 billion in the last year and Irish exports to that country reached &euro;1.2 billion last year.  The levels of trade with Iceland are, as one might expect, more modest.</P>
      <P>The issue of international jurisdiction and of the enforcement of judgments is also of ever-increasing relevance to the lives of ordinary citizens, outside the trade context.  For example, individuals may need to seek redress in an employment context.  If they are injured while abroad, they may need to take a case in another jurisdiction, and if a judgment is obtained in their favour, they may need to take enforcement proceedings here.  Conversely, if a civil case is brought before the courts of this State, there may be a need to seek to enforce any ensuing judgment in another jurisdiction.  Inevitably, as people become more mobile, international litigation is likely to grow.  Against that background, the predictability and certainty which is offered by the Brussels 1 and Lugano regimes are of considerable value.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specific provisions of the 2007 convention, the general rule of jurisdiction in the convention is the same as it was in the 1988 Lugano convention.  In essence, it requires that a defendant is to be sued in the country where he or she is domiciled.  For the purposes of the convention&rsquo;s operation in Ireland, domicile in this context equates with ordinary residence in so far as a natural person is concerned.  This rule applies regardless of whether a person is a citizen of the relevant state.</P>
      <P>However, in certain cases under the convention, a person can take proceedings in the courts of his or her own country even though the defendant in that action may be domiciled in another state bound by the convention.  In particular, there are certain protective rules in this respect covering consumer, insurance and employment contracts.  In such cases the plaintiff is considered to be in a vulnerable position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the other party and is, therefore, afforded a degree of latitude and protection.  Thus, in the case of consumer contract provisions, for example, if an Irish person purchases goods in a state bound by the convention and those goods subsequently turn out to be faulty, or are not delivered, the 2007 convention enables those consumers to bring the action before the Irish courts, should they so wish.</P>
      <P>Alongside, and as an alternative to the general rule of domicile, the 2007 convention keeps unchanged the existing structure that provides for special jurisdictions in a number of areas such as in matters relating to contract, maintenance and tort.  These jurisdictions are set out in Articles 5 to 7 of the convention.  These special rules recognise a link between the dispute itself and the court which may be called upon to hear it.  They come into play only where there is a sufficient connection in terms of the proceedings between the dispute and the court before which the matter is to be brought, from the point of view of the gathering of evidence or the conduct of the proceedings, or in order to secure better protection of the interests of the parties against which the proceedings are directed.</P>
      <P>The simplification of the procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments that fall within its scope is a fundamental aspect of the Lugano convention.  In this regard, all decisions given by a court or tribunal, whatever they may be called, are judgments, and the term also includes orders on costs or expenses made by an officer of the court, as happens in some European systems.</P>
      <P>Provisional and protective measures also fall within the definition of &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; if they are ordered by a court, provided that in the state which gave the judgment both parties were first given the opportunity to be heard.  The judgments of the Court of Justice or of other European Community law courts also come within the scope of the 2007 Lugano convention, as the term &ldquo;state bound by this convention&rdquo; may also mean the European Community.</P>
      <Col N="623" />
      <P>The changes made in the 2007 convention to the rules on the recognition and enforcement of decisions are based on the view that the intervention of the authorities of the state of enforcement can be scaled down and that the declaration of enforceability of a judgment can be reduced to little more than a formality.  This position is supported by an examination of the national case-law on the earlier conventions, which shows that appeals filed against declarations of enforceability under the Brussels and Lugano conventions are very small in number.</P>
      <P>There is no change to the convention&rsquo;s basic provisions on legal aid.  Thus, an applicant who in the state of origin of the judgment, has benefited from complete or partial legal aid, or exemption from costs or expenses, is entitled to the most favourable legal aid, or the most extensive exemption from costs or expenses, provided for by the law of the state addressed.  However, the application of this provision has a wider scope than obtained previously, as it covers the entire enforcement procedure, including any appeal proceedings.  In this context, the grounds for legal aid or exemption from costs or expenses are irrelevant.  They are determined by the law of the state of origin of the judgment, and are not subject to review.  In this regard, a certificate issued by the authority that gave the judgment for which recognition and enforcement are sought must indicate whether the applicant has benefited from legal aid, and this is sufficient to allow the applicant to qualify in the state addressed.</P>
      <P>The Bill is entirely technical in nature and I will now deal briefly with its contents.  Section 1 inserts a new Part IIIA into the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998, which deals with the Brussels 1 convention and the original Lugano convention.  The new Part deals exclusively with the 2007 Lugano convention.  It also inserts the 2007 Lugano convention as a Schedule to the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>The sections of the new Part IIIA can be outlined as follows.</P>
      <P>Section 20A contains standard interpretation provisions while Section 20B states that the convention has the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 20C provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the convention and of the explanatory report on it prepared by Professor Fausto Pocar.  The effect of this section is that the courts are taken to know of the provisions of these texts without the requirement to have them proven in evidence.  Judicial notice is also to be taken of relevant court decisions which, in this context, include decisions relating to the old Lugano convention and to the Brussels 1 regulation.</P>
      <P>Section 20D authorises the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make certain orders relating to convention matters, most notably that a specified state is a state bound by the convention, or that particular declarations or communications have been made.  While such orders are in force, they are of evidential value.</P>
      <P>Section 20E provides that an application under the convention for the recognition and enforcement in the State of a judgment shall be made to the master of the High Court for determination under the convention.  As a general principle, convention judgments are entitled to recognition without any special procedure being required.  In terms of enforcement, once the prescribed formalities have been completed the judgment is declared enforceable immediately without any review under Articles 34 and 35 of the convention, which set out the grounds for non-recognition.</P>
      <P>The main grounds for denying recognition, which will only come into play if the initial decision by the master is appealed to the High Court, relate to public policy and to an absence of fair procedures.  The latter arises mainly in default cases where the defendant was not served with the document instituting the proceedings, or with an equivalent document, in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable them to arrange for their defence, unless they failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for them to do so.</P>
      <Col N="624" />
      <P>Section 20F is concerned with the enforcement of convention judgments.  In broad terms it provides that a judgment, other than a maintenance order, in respect of which an enforcement order has been made, shall be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court, and that proceedings for its enforcement may be taken accordingly.</P>
      <P>On maintenance orders, provision is made in section 20G for the enforcement of such orders by the District Court.  An exception is made for cases where substantial arrears are involved as, in such a case, the enforcement machinery of the High Court might be more appropriate.  This section was amended on Seanad Committee Stage to take account of the change to section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 which was introduced by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.</P>
      <P>Section 20H deals with provisions in enforcement orders for the payment of interest on judgments and for the payment of costs.  While the convention is silent on the question of interest, clearly the spirit of the convention requires that foreign judgments should carry interest as provided for by the law of the state in which the judgments were made.  When a foreign court makes a judgment, it will either make specific provision for the payment of interest in the judgment itself or it will have made the judgment on the basis that its national provisions on interest will apply.  This section also contains provisions dealing with the payment of costs in applications for enforcement orders and with the payment of interest on those costs.</P>
      <P>Section 20I provides for fixing the currency and rate of exchange which should apply in the case of enforceable maintenance orders.  Sums required to be paid in respect of such orders are to be paid in the currency of the State.  If the amount stated in the maintenance order is other than in the currency of the State, it will be converted into the currency of the State on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the making of the enforcement order.  A certificate signed by an officer of an &ldquo;authorised institution&rdquo;, as defined in subsection (4), stating the prevailing exchange rate on a specified date, will be evidence of the facts contained in that certificate.</P>
      <P>Section 20J deals with the proof and admissibility of documents which must be produced when applying for the recognition or enforcement of a judgment given in another state bound by the convention.  This is a technical provision to avoid the need to take up court time in formally proving validity of the documents concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 20K deals with the granting by the High Court of provisional measures, which include protective measures.  Most commonly, such measures would be in the form of an injunction to restrain a defendant from transferring assets out of the jurisdiction in order to ensure that they would be available to satisfy any resulting judgment of the court seised of the substantive proceedings.  Subsection (1) of this section provides that the High Court will have the power to grant the provisional measures normally available to it, even if the substantive matter of the case falls to be heard by the courts of another state bound by the convention.</P>
      <P>This relates to Article 31 of the convention under which application may be made to the courts of a state bound by the convention for any provisional, including protective, measures as may be available in its law, even where jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter lies with the courts of another state bound by the convention.  The purpose of this article is to allow, for example, a foreign plaintiff who is proceeding against a defendant in Switzerland under the terms of the convention, to freeze any assets which that defendant may have in another state bound by the convention.  Thus, when judgment is given, that plaintiff can succeed in enforcing the judgment in that other state in circumstances where the defendant has no assets, or has insufficient assets, in Switzerland to meet the claim.</P>
      <Col N="625" />
      <P>The provisional measure most likely to be availed of is the Mareva injunction, which is used to restrain the disposal by the defendant of his or her goods or their removal from Irish jurisdiction so as to defeat any future judgment that may be given against him or her by the court seised of the substantive proceedings.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) gives the High Court discretion to refuse to grant provisional measures pursuant to subsection (1), if it thinks that the grant of such measures would be inexpedient.  The purpose of the subsection is to make it clear that the High Court is not compelled by subsection (1) to grant provisional measures.  Subsection (3) provides that an application to the Master of the High Court to grant an enforcement order may include an application for any protective measures which the High Court has power to grant in proceedings that, apart from this Act, are within its jurisdiction.  This subsection is subject to Article 47(3) of the convention, which safeguards the rights of the defendant pending the elapse of the time during which an appeal can be made.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (4), when an enforcement order is made, the Master of the High Court does not have discretion to refuse an application for protective measures, provided the measures sought are measures which the High Court would have power to grant in other proceedings which fall within its jurisdiction.  This follows on from Article 47 of the convention, which specifies that a person is automatically entitled to obtain protective measures on the granting of an enforcement order.</P>
      <P>The distinction between provisional and protective measures can be summarised as follows.  Provisional measures can be applied for at any time and, under Irish law, one can apply for an injunction provided one has issued or is about to issue an originating summons.  On the other hand, the protective measures referred to in Article 47 can only be applied for and obtained in the context of the granting of an enforcement order, the judgment itself having already been given in the state of origin.</P>
      <P>Section 20L deals with domicile for the purposes of the convention.  As already mentioned, domicile is the connecting factor used in the convention to link a person with a state for the purposes of grounding jurisdiction.  The convention does not define &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; but provides, in Article 59, that it is to be determined in accordance with the law of each state bound by the convention.  In Ireland, domicile would normally be understood in the common law sense which, in broad terms, means that an individual is considered to be domiciled in the country in which he or she intends to reside permanently or for an indefinite period.  However, for the purposes of this convention and of equivalent instruments, domicile is assigned a particular meaning which assimilates it more closely with ordinary residence.  The convention itself contains autonomous rules on the domicile of companies or other legal persons.  The legislation itself does not affect the general concept of domicile under Irish law as applied in other circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 20M sets out the venue at which certain convention proceedings may be brought in so far as the Circuit and District Courts are concerned.  This is necessary because certain articles of the convention give a general jurisdiction to the courts of the state where the defendant is domiciled.  However, they do not establish venues for the lower courts and that matter falls to be determined by national law.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 20N makes it clear that Part III of the 1998 Act, which relates to the 1988 Lugano convention &mdash; the repeal of which is provided for in section 3 &mdash; only retains a relevance as set out in Article 65.  Article 65 provides that the convention shall supersede conventions on the same subject matter concluded between states bound by the convention, but it is subject to some transitional provisions set out in Article 63(2), and to Articles 66 and 67 which cover the relationship between the convention and other international agreements, as well as Community instruments such as the Brussels 1 regulation.</P>
      <Col N="626" />
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for various textual amendments to the Maintenance Act 1994, which are required in consequence of the implementation of the 2007 Lugano Convention.</P>
      <P>Section 4 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and the relevant collective citation for the purposes of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill is wholly uncontroversial.  However, this does not mean that it is devoid of importance or significance, nor does it mean that it is not complex.  It is both a product of and a contributor to the ever-increasing international ties which bind us to other countries, particularly in the commercial sphere.  I look forward to the comments of Deputies and I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank Opposition Deputies for the additional time required to enable me to place on the record of the House the relevant background information concerning this piece of legislation and the substance within it.</P>

      <P>The last paragraph of the Minister&rsquo;s speech is probably the most important one.  The Bill is complex and boring but it is important, particularly for a small open economy like ours, in order to bring a level of confidence to credit and the flow of trade that depends on such credit.  As the Minister said, maybe its significance for civil matters can also be lost when one looks at trade agreements.  We will be supporting all Stages of the Bill.  When one considers the complexity of legal systems across Europe, including EFTA, and what this Bill is trying to achieve, those in the Department and others involved in drafting this legislation deserve our compliments.  There was probably not a queue of officials wanting to get involved in this Bill.  It is important legislation which Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to support and see all Stages through the House today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Technical Group supports this Bill.  I welcome it as necessary and technical legislation in our ever-changing society and trading markets, especially in this time of deep recession across the world and certainly in Europe.  One could say Ireland is a small and isolated country.  For years, however, we thought Europe regarded us as having punched above our weight.  Now we have newer trading partners as seen with the recent visit of the Chinese Vice President.  Accordingly, it is important safeguards are in place for any persons or companies doing international business and trade or international companies trading here to ensure they can legally pursue payments they are owed that may not have been paid.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with section 20H on the payment of court costs and the interest on settlements, particularly in Revenue cases.  From reading newspapers, one sees many instances where up to 60% of a settlement made by an individual or business with the Revenue was interest and penalties.  We need to be careful with this because in some cases it may not be that those involved did not want to pay.  Some people may have problems with paying for goods or may be in a difficult trading position.  It should not be a gravy train for anyone either.  There should be some cap on these charges because, if they applied over several years, they could be very punitive and this concerns me.</P>
      <P>Section 20J deals with avoiding the need to take up court time.  Everyone who has had to go to the Circuit Court or High Court knows it takes for ever and a day.  If one has a complex case, one has little chance of getting it dealt with in the Circuit Court in the regions because <Col N="627" />the court only sits for a certain number of days &mdash; four I think &mdash; which means cases can go on for years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section on the prevention of the removal of assets.  Whether it is a case of paying maintenance or trying to oblige, or not to oblige in some cases, under a maintenance order, it is vital some measures are in place to ensure assets are not transferred.  We saw what went on in the financial industry in the past.  It is an important provision because some people can have clever and ingenious ways of moving goods and assets resulting in no recourse to justice for reparation or the payment of goods.</P>
      <P>The Technical Group will support this Bill.  I compliment the Minister and his officials on bringing it forward.  I hope it has a speedy passage and my comments will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their support for what is very important and technical legislation which will ensure mutual enforcement of judgments with the countries to which the Lugano convention applies.  The Bill itself, as I said, is not controversial.</P>
      <P>In the context of the matter raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath, it is important that where someone is successful in litigation, they can recover costs against the unsuccessful party.  That applies to domestic and international litigation.  It is the great benefit, if one is talking in the area of commercial judgments, if an individual based in this country or an Irish company is successful in litigation with a foreign company or individual, that they should be able to cover any legal costs they incurred in circumstances they were proved right in the court action they took, in circumstances in which their rights had been violated or injuries had been done to them, or in circumstances in which there had been a breach of a commercial arrangement.</P>
      <P>We have mechanisms, as do other countries, for adjudicating on legal costs.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath knows, the Legal Services Bill, of which he was critical, has been brought before the House and contains substantive provisions to provide greater transparency in the area of legal costs and to provide an updated method for legal costs adjudication.  It is important to remember when legal costs are ordered, the person who got the benefit of that order was successful in litigation and may have been forced to go to the courts to protect their circumstances because they had been violated by the unsuccessful party to that litigation.  They have to have the means in justice to recover their legal costs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is also important an interest penalty is in place.  Where orders for costs are made, if they are disobeyed by the litigant against whom the order was made, or if they fail to pay the sum agreed by way of legal costs for the successful litigant, or if they defy and ignore a legal costs adjudication by, currently, the Taxing Master, by an appeal in the courts or, in future, by the legal costs adjudicator, there must be some pressure they can be put under to ensure they fulfil their legal obligations, do not defy the courts and that innocent litigants who have been forced to resort to the courts to protect their position can recover the costs they have already paid for the litigation in which they have been forced to engage.  The interest penalty that is imposed is designed to provide an incentive to those against whom orders for costs have been made to meet their obligations and where they fail to do so on time to compensate the successful litigant by way of an interest payment where appropriate for any failure to comply with court orders.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for giving me some additional time to put the background to the Bill on the record of the House.  I agree with Deputies opposite.  I thank my officials for the work done on what is complex legislation, the detailed manner in which they assisted its explanation in my Second Stage speech and in the explanatory memorandum, the latter which is helpful in working through the mysteries of what this is all about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2">
      <NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Education is very much to the forefront in recent weeks following the Minister&rsquo;s announcements on various aspects of education.  In my county we have had public meetings about teacher numbers and DEIS schools and there will be further public meetings next week at which people will express concern at the cuts proposed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill has one significant difference to the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010, which was introduced by the then Minister, Ms Mary Coughlan, which failed to pass following the dissolution of the D&aacute;il in 2011.  As is his right, the Minister was entitled to re-examine the Bill and come up with his own ideas.  The most obvious difference is the section relating to the power of the Minister on the appointment, redeployment and dismissal of teachers.  Under the Education Act 1998 those procedures had to be agreed with the Minister and the education partners.  However, the Bill stipulates that the procedures can be established following consultation rather than agreement.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position during his reply.  It seems strange that the agreement of the partners will no longer be required.  The Minister has evidently given some thought to the issue and I am sure he will be able to explain the reason for the change in the procedure from the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that teachers who are surplus will be redeployed, as per the commitment in the Croke Park agreement.  It therefore places elements of the Croke Park agreement into the legislation.  While managing bodies have expressed concern with the section and how it will affect their right to protect their school ethos, we believe schools are still protected in that regard.  It is true that teachers may be redeployed to schools with a different ethos but I hope that would not cause significant problems.  Perhaps the Minister would reiterate the discussions he had in that regard with school management groups and the various teachers&rsquo; organisations.</P>
      <P>The sections which allow the employment of unregistered teachers in certain limited circumstances are unnecessary in light of the significant number of unemployed teachers.  We also believe that the Minister should consider a ban on hiring retired teachers.  That continues to be a problem for qualified, young graduates seeking work.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify how many retired teachers are currently working in schools.  That has been a big bone of contention for young teachers throughout my political life.  Young teachers find it difficult to acquire work yet in many cases retired teachers are quickly back at work.  It may have been necessary to employ retired teachers in the past but it should not be happening currently given the number of unemployed teachers.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have received representations from young teachers and their parents about the lack of teaching posts, either temporary or full time, yet retired teachers are returning to the classroom.  In the current climate of high unemployment it would be far better if young graduate teachers were employed even on a part-time basis.  They could put their skills and ability to use in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2">
      <NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Dubai and other such countries offer big salaries to Irish teachers who go there to work.  That would be a pity.  Graduate teachers are highly talented and skilled.  In the past month five young teachers came to see me to find out whether they could get part-time work in schools in the county or even within the country.  A number of years ago schools found it difficult to find qualified teachers at short notice but that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>Section 30 is mainly concerned with ensuring schools only employ teachers who are qualified and registered in accordance with the standards set by the Teaching Council.  The section has never been implemented and there has therefore never been a statutory obligation to employ registered teachers.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There are some positives in the Bill.  The section which will allow the Teaching Council to make a renewal of registration conditional on a number of factors including continuing professional development is important for improving the standards of the profession.  Section 24(5) of the 1998 Act, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill, introduces the redeployment of teachers into primary legislation for the first time.  It states that statutory underpinning of an effective redeployment scheme will help ensure that surplus positions are absorbed in the schools sector leading to cost savings.  Redeployment will take place in cases where a school is over quota, as outlined in the Croke Park agreement, and also in the case of school closures as agreed in the social partnership agreement terms 2016.  Under the Bill, when a teacher is redeployed it means he or she will become an employee of the board of the school to which he or she is sent.  Teachers may also be redeployed to a school with a different ethos.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The previous and current Ministers have put much thought and effort into producing the Bill.  Based on the representations made to me, the one area that is of concern is the exclusion of the need for agreement on procedures.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the reduction in the number of teachers that will take place in schools because of the changes made to the pupil-teacher ratio and in DEIS schools. What will happen to those teachers?  There is a major concern within the profession and among parents.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, many public meetings have been held around the country.  We have been summoned to one next week in County Wexford to explain the situation and to get a lashing for the Minister&rsquo;s decisions.  To highlight the situation, all of the county&rsquo;s Oireachtas Members have been invited to a meeting in Bree where between 300 and 400 people, from teachers to parents, are expected to attend.  I am sure that they will also bring some students.</P>
      <P>The concern is that small school areas will be particularly affected.  Wexford does not have as many small schools as other parts of the country but people are concerned that the number we have will lose some of their teachers and be unable to provide the standard of education required by parents and students.  The Minister has made a few changes but he should reflect further on the road he is taking in respect of small schools, particularly given the seriousness of the situation that is developing in rural areas.  It will affect the future education ofchildren.</P>
      <P>At a time when the rate of unemployment is so high it is important that we provide people with the best education.  We must encourage young people to attain a high level of primary, secondary and third level education.  In my day, someone with a leaving certificate could walk into just about any job.  Now, one needs a masters degree to get many of the jobs that are vacant.  People who do not have the necessary qualifications or levels of education have few opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, share responsibility for what was the old F&Aacute;S.  My county was dependent on the building industry <Col N="630" />and its high payment levels prompted a significant number of young people to leave school at 15 or 16 years of age.</P>

The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, are making a number of changes but I hope that they will be in a position to introduce new schemes that target the large number of young people who are on the dole in Wexford and provide them with reskilling and retraining so that they might avail of other opportunities.  Will the Minister give serious consideration to this proposal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill and education generally.  Education is one of the most important issues we must address, particularly given the need to protect it at a time when finances are so tight.  I will use this opportunity to discuss with the Minister some of the measures he is taking.  I hope that he will be able to respond to my points.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Minister&rsquo;s approach to DEIS schools, I welcome his decision to reverse the cuts to band 1 and band 2 schools.  As he acknowledged, those cuts needed to be undone.  They affected many disadvantaged students and undid work that had made a significant impact in the schools in question, in that children who needed extra attention during their early years of development were given it.  The work ensured a higher level of school continuance from primary to secondary level.  I have seen its benefits in many of the schools in my area.  The situation was made clear to the Minister through the many submissions made to him by the schools as part of the review process.</P>
      <P>It is incomprehensible that in reversing the cuts to DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools, the Minister did not adopt the same approach towards rural DEIS schools and allow them to retain their legacy posts, which are as important to those schools as they are to band 1 and band 2 schools.  After accepting that he had made a mistake and agreeing to review the situation, he did not reverse the decision in respect of 45% of the posts in question, which means they will be lost in September.  That does not make sense.  I understand the financial implications and the pressures being placed on the Minister, but it does not add up that a band 2 school in an urban area will retain teachers whereas a school a few miles away in a rural area &mdash; I am aware of many such schools that are even more disadvantaged &mdash; will not.</P>
      <P>This flies in the face of many of the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the review.  His argument concerns the finances but his decision to reverse the cuts should have been applied to every DEIS school.  That cuts now target rural schools in particular is unfair.  In many rural areas, the <Col N="631" />level of disadvantage is higher than it is in urban areas.  They should have received similar treatment.</P>
      <P>I am concerned by the level of consistency between the Minister&rsquo;s approach to this matter and his approach to the budget.  Many of the cuts he sought were directed at rural and smaller schools.  He has reduced the pupil-teacher ratio that will be required during the next three years for those schools to retain their posts.  Scoil Colmcille in Glengad in north County Donegal is a five-teacher school that will become a three-teacher school.  It will lose a legacy post due to the DEIS cuts and a second post as a result of the changes in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It was due to retain the second post but backdating the budgetary change means it is in line to lose a mainstream teacher.  All of this is happening despite the fact that its pupil numbers will increase in September.</P>
      <P>The Minister has announced an appeals system for schools whose pupil numbers will increase in September.  I hope that, given the significant increase at Scoil Colmcille, it will maintain its mainstream post.  To this end, I urge the Minister to give the matter the utmost attention in his review.  In light of the Minister&rsquo;s partial reverse, it is disappointing that the school has lost its DEIS post.  The impact of the programme on the school has been exceptional.  The school has submitted a report to the Minister based on its research on retention rates at secondary level of students who graduated from it.  The learning supports and reductions in pupil-teacher ratios made possible by DEIS have resulted in students remaining in education until leaving certificate level and beyond to third level.</P>
      <P>The policy of allocating teachers based on student enrolment in the preceding year results in an inconsistency that needs to be addressed.  The Minister should consider introducing an appeals system for schools which are due to lose a teacher despite increased enrolment in the current year because they need to be able to maintain their allocation.  Yesterday, I met representatives from Rathshenny national school, which is due to lose a teacher next September because its enrolment was slightly below the threshold for their current allocation.  However, its enrolment will increase by nine students in the coming year.  It does not make sense to reduce teacher numbers in a school where student enrolment is increasing.  These schools will end up with larger class sizes because their teacher numbers will not reflect their enrolment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to liaise with his Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, on the impact of the proposed cuts in school transport at primary level.  The regulation under which new students will be unable to access school transport unless they are attending the nearest school will force families to send their children to different schools from those their older siblings are attending.  This policy has not been thought through properly and should be reviewed.  During the general election campaign, a significant number of Fine Gael Deputies gave commitments that the policy would be reviewed but nothing has happened since then and both the Minister and the Minister of State insist they fully intend to proceed with it.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well with the Bill but I am disappointed by his attitude to smaller schools in rural areas.  I ask him to reconsider his approach to the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I will use the opportunity to draw attention to the difficulties faced by young qualified teachers in gaining employment, even on a temporary, part-time or substitute basis.  There is widespread disquiet among young teachers, particularly at primary level, at the perception that retired and unqualified teachers are being employed in their place.  Shortly after taking office the Minister sent a circular to primary schools which set out strict guidelines on the employment of retired and unqualified teachers.  His initiative has helped to reassure newly qualified teachers, particularly in the context of figures which indicated that the number of retired teachers returning to the system has decreased significantly, because it gave them some hope of getting into employment.</P>
      <Col N="632" />
      <P>Teaching remains a valued and sought after profession.  The role of our teachers cannot be overstated.  The country will not recover by repeating the mistake of putting all our eggs in the one basket of construction jobs.  Our young qualified teachers have an important role to play in terms of helping young people to find highly skilled employment and allowing the Government to attract foreign investors based on our high standard of our education.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on how he dealt with junior and leaving certificate classes.  Concerns were expressed by students and parents about the effect that retirements from the public service would have on examination preparations.  These concerns were addressed in a sensible way and there was only limited employment of retired teachers.  However, I hope the posts vacated by these retirements will be offered to young qualified teachers.</P>
      <P>Qualified teachers who pursued further up-skilling such as master&rsquo;s degrees in language teaching after failing to secure employment are concerned that they will not be rewarded for their additional training.  They will be hit on the double by the cuts to salary and allowances.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I listened intently to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan last night while she outlined her views on the Teaching Council.  As a former teacher, I agree with much of what she said.  I often wondered what the Teaching Council was doing.  The Deputy suggested it is merely an extra layer of bureaucracy that does nothing to support or raise teaching standards.  I do not want to condemn the council but I ask the Minister to examine its functions closely because I believe they could be performed in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the education budget is focused on front line services.  Those of us who represent rural constituencies are conscious of the changes recently announced to pupil-teacher ratios in small schools.  I am not sure if the previous speaker is aware that an appeals mechanism was recently announced that will allow a small school, which can demonstrate and verify increasing numbers in September 2012 and beyond that, to retain a teacher.  In other words such schools will not be condemned solely on the basis of the September 2011 figures, which I welcome.  I had urged the Minister to have a flexible approach on that aspect and I welcome his response.  This is a very emotive issue and, as one who attended a rural school, I recognise their value.</P>
      <P>Outside teacher allocation, many of the supports for small schools, including caretaking allowance, cleaning allowance, secretarial allowance, resource teachers and capitation based on 60 pupils even though a school might only have 15 or 20, were not touched in the budget.  I have urged the Minister to show flexibility to DEIS rural schools.  For example, because the school in Aughleam in my constituency was a DEIS rural school, it could lose a legacy post and another post, moving it from a four-teacher school to only having two teachers.  To lose 50% of its teacher allocation in a few years would be too much.  I urge the Minister to address the matter on a case-by-case basis, which I believe he has promised to do.</P>
      <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill.  Education is a very important sector in our economy and it is vital that it delivers to the highest standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Education (Amendment) Bill 2012, which abolishes the Educational Disadvantage Committee and allows for the employment of unregistered teachers in limited circumstances.  It also gives the Minister for Education and Skills greater power in deciding procedures for the employment, redeployment and dismissal of teachers.  It deals with the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act 1997 and the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Act 1998.</P>
      <Col N="633" />
      <P>The Bill gives the Minister for Education and Skills the power to redeploy a teacher, who is surplus to requirements in one school, to a school where a vacancy exists, while also ensuring that the commitments in the Croke Park agreement are honoured.  While intending that all teachers will be registered by the Teaching Council, there will be a balance between having teachers fully qualified and registered, and in certain exceptional cases allowing schools to employ unregistered teachers on short-term rolling contracts.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the HSE is responsible for speech therapists in schools, which has caused confusion for parents and professionals in the past.  The Bill seeks to provide a clearer separation of functions between the Department and the HSE.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While the number of teachers in recent years has fluctuated, mainly in secondary schools, the number of teaching staff in primary and secondary schools has increased by 2,823 from 55,851 in the 2006-07 school year to 58,674 in the 2010-11 school year.  The Government has committed to increasing the number of teaching staff over the next two years.  At the same time, the national recovery plan has given a commitment to reform terms and conditions within the teaching profession in line with a commitment in the Croke Park agreement as follows.  There will be a comprehensive review and revision of the contract for teachers and other educational staff, including special needs assistants, staff in vocational education committees, institutes of technology and universities, to identify and remove the impediments to the provision of effective services.  Teachers and academic staff will be required to work an additional hour per week to provide a wide range of needs in various institutions, which will be committed to flexible delivery of new courses specifically aimed at the unemployed.  There will be a process of redeployment at all levels to facilitate restructuring in the second and third level sectors.  Improvements will be made in the substitution and supervision roster for teachers in second level schools.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council Act 2001 and the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2006 provide a legislative framework for regulating the teaching profession, promoting and developing teaching as a profession.  The specific functions of the Teaching Council are as follows: to promote teaching as a profession; to promote the continuing professional development of teachers; to establish and maintain a register of teachers; to establish, publish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct, which include teaching knowledge, skills and competence; to regulate the professional conduct of teachers; and to maintain and improve the standard of teachers.  More than 73,000 teachers are on the register of teachers.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the grant he gave the De La Salle secondary school in Dundalk, which has been allocated almost &euro;500,000.  Demand for places in this school has been very high and this will solve a major problem in the local area.  I also refer to the education of persons with special educational needs, which is fantastic.  We need to give small schools an opportunity to look at their teachers.  R&eacute;alt Na Mara is the only school in Dundalk that has facilities for children with autism.  At the moment the school has 19 teachers.  If the new system is introduced, this will reduce to 15.  I ask the Minister to consider this case in detail.  It is very important to keep as many teachers as possible in these types of schools.  I have been talking to many parents for whom a school such as the R&eacute;alt Na Mara dedicated to looking after children with autism is very important.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his initiative in announcing this morning an allocation of more than &euro;30 million to assist with the replacement of prefabs with permanent structures in more than 200 schools.  It will generate considerable employment in the building sector, including architects, electrical contractors and others.</P>
      <Col N="634" />
      <P>The Bill provides for the procedures governing the appointment of teachers which will be decided by the Minister for Education and Skills with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister need not consult with or seek the agreement of other parties.  Following the establishment of the procedures, the appointment of a principal, along with other teachers and staff members, remains the responsibility of a school&rsquo;s board of management.  Schools&rsquo; boards of management play a vital role and at times they can be faced with issues concerning staff, in particular discipline and similar matters that occur in all schools.  Boards are often required to take difficult decisions.</P>
      <P>Under the existing section 23 of the Education Act 1998, procedures for the appointment of the principal must be agreed between the Minister, the patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union or staff association representing teachers.  The original proposal in the 2010 Bill regarding VEC involvement has been dropped and is not included in the Bill.  I note the Minister has decided to await the report on school patronage.  However, I urge him to consider this proposal in any future legislation he may introduce.  As a former member of Sligo VEC, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the VEC model, which would have much to offer if extended into primary education.  The Minister will shortly introduce legislation to amalgamate existing vocational educational committees, which will result in the educational and skills boards being located at various locations.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, should review the 2010 Bill and consider the extension of the VEC model to primary education when that Bill is brought to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 30 of the Bill which provides that teachers may only be employed if they are registered and, more importantly, qualified according to standards defined by the Teaching Council.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 expressly prohibits the payment of non-recognised teachers in recognised schools from State funds.  However, it has not been enacted to date and there is currently no statutory obligation to employ only registered teachers.  The Department acknowledges that there are some unqualified teachers working in schools and it is believed that up to half of all 3,200 primary schools have employed an unqualified teacher for up to one week during the first half of the 2011 school year.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council has reported that 73,000 teachers are currently registered.  The register will set the mark of professional recognition for teachers and set out standards of knowledge, which is important.  It will oblige teachers to engage in ongoing training and curriculum training.  This measure will enhance the job prospects of our new, recently qualified teachers and will provide a better education to children especially in cases where maternity or sick leave must be filled in our schools.  In certain circumstances the Minister will allow the employment of unregistered teachers.  However, this will only be in limited circumstances, in instances where there is a genuine shortage and where the substitute is required at short notice.  The employment of teachers who are not registered because of their unfitness to teach will not be possible under the Bill and I welcome this measure as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education (Amendment) Bill provides for several important changes to the Education Act 1998 and the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Notably, it aims to ensure that all teachers in schools are registered with the Teaching Council and are fully qualified and suitable for the essential role they are expected to play in the education of our children.  Any improvement that can be made to existing legislation which ensures teaching personnel are of the highest professional standard is to be welcomed.  It is vital that the well-being of <Col N="635" />children being taught in Irish classrooms is a top priority for the Government and society.  Yesterday evening, our party spokesperson on education matters, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, gave our party&rsquo;s considered response to the Bill.  He outlined what we deem to be good and he identified areas where we believes changes might be needed and what those changes might be.  I do not propose to repeat the points made by Deputy Crowe.</P>
      <P>There is something altogether wrong when the child population is increasing while newly qualified teachers must emigrate.  This makes no sense to me.  It is unfair and discriminatory that newly qualified teachers, including those with the highest qualifications, should be paid considerably less than their peers already working in the system.  Inevitably, this will lead to a worsening of morale among staff throughout the school system.  This change should be reversed immediately.</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me for being parochial.  I will seek to ensure that the public pledge given by the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, to the effect that no rural schools in Sligo Leitrim North will close under his watch, will be honoured in full and I will watch that space closely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will proceed from what is in the Bill to what is not in the Bill but should be.  There remains a serious gap in Irish education legislation not addressed in the Bill.  This relates to the issue of how we handle allegations of abuse, bullying or emotional abuse of pupils by teachers.  The Minister and the Department of Education and Skills profess that they are powerless to intervene in such matters and that it is up to an individual school&rsquo;s board of management to process any complaints or allegations of abuse or bullying made against teachers.  That is not a delegation of responsibility, it is an abdication of responsibility.  It does not represent child welfare or protection, it is institutional welfare and protection.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to overstate the scale or extent of this problem.  I realise the vast majority of teachers are good, committed professionals who adhere to the highest possible standards.  However, if teacher bullying or psychological or physical abuse of children occurs even once, that is once too often.  It is clearly a flawed system when the Minister and Department of Education and Skills provide funding for educational institutions but have no oversight for or input into the protection of children in the education system.  It is incredible.</P>
      <P>The Minister responded to a parliamentary question of mine on 16 November 2011 as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">There is no requirement for school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department. My Department therefore does not maintain data in this regard.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In the course of the same reply the Minister stated: &ldquo;I have no plans to introduce any additional legislation as suggested by the Deputy.&rdquo;  How can it be right that a parent or child who alleges bullying by a teacher has no recourse except to the board of management of the school?  In most cases those on the board would be close friends of the teacher subject of the complaint.  How can it be right that the Minister and the Department cannot investigate serious complaints against teachers and cannot instruct schools to follow a particular course of action with regard to individual complaint cases?</P>
      <P>Schools&rsquo; boards of management are not independent, qualified, autonomous bodies capable of investigating allegations of abuse against teachers.  They are part of the system and they will protect the system and those who work in it.  School boards of management carry out exceptional work the length and breadth of the country but they cannot or should not be regarded as independent, qualified judges when dealing with allegations of abuse against teachers.  We <Col N="636" />have all seen in recent history the consequences of closing our eyes and pretending all is rosy behind closed doors.  Have we learned nothing from that?</P>
      <P>Legislation should be brought forward urgently to enable the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills to work with the HSE to investigate and resolve allegations of teacher bullying or psychologically damaging children.  Such an approach would ensure children are assessed by HSE professionals trained in the area of child welfare.  It would also involve professionals from the Department of Education and Skills who are trained in school policy, procedures and responsibilities.  This would ensure a uniform, standard, professional, accountable process nationally to deal with such allegations.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware &mdash; I have brought it to his attention and forwarded the file to him &mdash; of a young boy from County Sligo who has been out of school now for more than two years because he was wrongly accused in public of bullying by a school principal.  Despite exhaustive efforts by the boy&rsquo;s parents, which involved correspondence and discussions with politicians, civil servants, the school principal, board of management, the National Educational Welfare Board and HSE, the case is as far from resolution as ever.  An eminent psychologist has testified to the great damage being done to this child and has indicated that the process of recovery can only begin when the school principal clears the boy&rsquo;s name and reputation publicly in the eyes and ears of the school population.  However, nothing has happened and the boy is still at home more than two years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">

      <P>What age is he now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is 16 and half years of age.  He is desperately unhappy.  He is not mixing with his peers.  He spends all his time at home and has on occasion threatened to run away from home and worse.  His parents are at their wits&rsquo; end.  They have spent the past two years of their lives trying to have this matter resolved.  They have tried every avenue except civil legal action but always run into a cul-de-sac of official impotence.  This good and decent family has lost all respect for politicians and the political system.  They have also lost respect for me, because although I want to help, I am unable to bring about the change that is needed.   They ask, with understandable grounds, how any political system that claims to cherish and protect children can allow such a situation to continue with no avenue of address, let alone redress.  They are angry, frustrated and disillusioned that politicians and the political system cannot see the wrong and correct it immediately.  They spend sleepless nights wondering how their son can survive this cruel episode unscathed.  The Minister has said previously and I agree that this sort of situation is disgraceful and should not be tolerated in any civilised society.</P>
      <P>I would take the Minister to be a compassionate, caring and committed person and I ask him to put himself into the shoes of these parents and imagine for a moment what his life would be like if one of his young children was going through this ordeal.  I believe the Minister knows it is wrong that this boy is a prisoner in his own home and that his psychological development is being greatly damaged by the failure of our legislative system to provide access to justice in this case.  Home tuition is being provided but it is not the solution.  The solution lies in legislating for an open, transparent, professional, independent, competent and accountable system to process allegations of abuse against teachers.  It is deeply disappointing that the Bill contains nothing to address this.</P>
      <P>Recently, I joined our party spokespersons on education, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and Senator Kathryn Reilly, for a meeting with members of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition.  During that meeting it became very clear to me that bullying of and by teachers is not uncommon.  It happens and what I am talking about is not an isolated incident.  However, bullying is notori<Col N="637" />ously difficult to resolve short of civil legal action.  We commend the NABC for the very important job it is doing in addressing the many types of bullying taking place within primary and secondary schools, which tragically lead in some cases to mental health problems, incidents of self-harm and suicide.  We support the work of the NABC and the implementation of the Safe School programme which introduces accredited measures to address bullying and is based on empirical research and best practice in other countries, for example Finland.</P>
      <P>The Minister holds the key to ensuring that young people like my young constituent and his parents can get justice.  He has the right, the power and, I would argue, the responsibility to amend this Bill to incorporate the points I have raised.  We cannot say we do not know what is going on: we know.  We cannot and never would prejudge the outcome of any investigation, but we know there must be a process that will allow an investigation be held.  We cannot say we are unaware of the potentially very serious consequences for this young lad from Sligo and his parents, and possibly for hundreds if not thousands of pupils and parents throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I believe my job in opposition is not simply to oppose policy, therefore, it would be wrong of me to oppose policy purely for the sake of opposition.  I believe my job here as an Opposition Deputy includes helping Government make better choices, decisions, policies and legislation and I take that responsibility seriously.  In this spirit, I would gladly work with the Minister and his officials to address this issue.  I have no doubt an amendment along the lines I have set out would receive extensive cross-party support.  Will the Minister turn that key by agreeing to incorporate such an amendment?  If he does so, he will not only initiate much needed legislation, but will offer hope and a restoration of trust in the democratic system for these parents in Sligo and for parents and  students throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  He has been a very progressive Minister since he took on the education portfolio and if he has done nothing else, he has stimulated debate on the whole education system.  I was part of that system at one stage as I did the H.Dip and taught for a short period.  I compliment Deputy Colreavy on raising the issue of bullying and on highlighting that it is a two-way process, because there are teachers being bullied and they and students must be equally protected.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have some concern about the Educational Disadvantage Committee, the structures around it, its timeframe and the process we are now going through to remove it.  This committee was established under the Education Act 1998.  In 2000, former Member, Michael Finucane asked the then Minister when the committee would be established, yet it was not established until 2002.  It reported in 2005 and its work finished then.  I often wonder if the committee had been established shortly after the enactment of the Bill and had reported in 2000 or 2001 whether we would have the problems now associated with the DEIS schools, because many of the issues associated with DEIS schools had not arisen before the report of this committee was completed.  My criticism is probably not a criticism of the Minister but it is a criticism of the permanent government, the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I suggest that when a Bill is being enacted we should ensure that any committee, report or whatever else is required to be done following the Act, is done as quickly as possible.  We can see from the example of this committee how these issues are delayed.  The budget was removed from the committee in 2008 but we are only now removing the committee from the provisions of the statute.  I urge the Minister to act quickly in this kind of situation.  When we decide to <Col N="638" />do something such as put a committee in place, we should do it quickly so that there are no legacy issues.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I applaud the Minister for introducing the concept of flexibility in the Bill.  The economy has changed so much over the past number of years that flexibility is now a key word.  We talk about flexibility in the workforce, in the education system, in what we learn and in how we direct our younger generation towards what is important for their future and jobs.  I met members of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed yesterday and they were using the key word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; also.  They understand that the workforce must change dramatically, and education has a huge part in that.</P>
      <P>I have seen flexibility at first hand in the teaching profession.  Last Monday, I visited a rural, DEIS primary school where a teacher was absent for a day and noted how quickly the principal was able to get a substitute teacher.  There was a pool of teachers in the local area who could step in and take over at short notice.  However, there is a problem with substitution in the secondary school system because teachers teach specific subjects.  If those teachers are absent for a day, a substitute teacher is unlikely to be a teacher of the same subject and pupils lose out as a result.   A teacher can be out for a week or two and it is possible that pupils are losing out on two weeks of education.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to consider the establishment of a pool of young teachers who have just qualified to cater for this kind of circumstance.  I remember applying for many jobs after I qualified from NUI Maynooth in 1983.  Many principals who were keen to take me on were concerned by my lack of experience.  I could not get experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I will give an example.  If we put together a pool of teachers in County Kildare who are qualified to teach a specific subject, the principal of a school in the county that needs a substitute teacher of mathematics or geography can get a suitable teacher from that pool and thereby ensure the pupils in the school do not lose out.  The same thing could be done in the case of oral examinations.  Rather than taking teachers out of class to do an oral examination in another school, perhaps we could put in place a pool of retired or newly qualified teachers who would do oral exams in our schools.  That would ensure classrooms are not disrupted.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It has been suggested that the Educational Disadvantage Committee was a quango.  That was not the case.  It was established specifically to report on disadvantage in education and it did so very quickly.  Its report was acted on by the Government at the time.  Many of the quangos in the Department of Education and Skills need to be amalgamated or abolished as quickly as possible.  When I spoke in the House the other day about another quango that is being abolished, I said we seem to be a little slow in reducing the number of quangos.  I am sure a single quango could do the same job as three or four of the quangos in the Department of Education and Skills.  I hope the Minister will consider taking that on board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister is acting in a proactive manner.  I will support him as he continues to make progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertDowds">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lawlor, I commend the Minister on his active determination to improve our education system despite the difficult circumstances in which he has to operate.  As the Minister is aware, I have a great deal of teaching experience.  I am speaking in <Col N="639" />the context of my experience as a teacher and as a principal in mainstream schools and in a school for physically disabled children.</P>
      <P>I would like to concentrate on a couple of areas, the first of which is section 6 of the Bill.  It may come as a surprise to Deputies to hear that I welcome the provisions in this section that provide for the suspension and dismissal of teachers by boards of management in accordance with procedures determined by the Minister.  Any dismissal of an employee should take place as a last resort.  If it is possible to give guidance and assistance to teachers who are somehow in distress or difficulty, that should be done.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the vast majority of teachers and public servants do an excellent job.  From time to time, the practices of a small number of teachers bring teaching into disrepute.  Part of the problem in the broader public service is that it is difficult to dismiss a public servant.  That needs to be examined.  It is wrong that people can be paid for a job they are not doing.  It detracts from the value of the excellent work that is being done by others.  It is one of the factors that leads to criticism of the public service, including the teaching profession.  I accept that such criticism is often grossly unfair.</P>
      <P>In addition to boards of management being involved in dismissals, it is important for departmental inspectors to be allowed make an input.  As Deputy Colreavy said earlier, boards of management often have to deal with cases involving people who know each other very well.  That can be a positive or a negative thing.  I hope the Minister will ensure inspectors are involved in decisions of this nature.  That would help to guarantee a level of objectivity, which is important.  Unfortunately, people can be picked on because they happen to be disliked by larger groups.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides for the inclusion in the Education Act 1998 of a new section 23(1)(<i>e</i>), which provides that one of the duties and responsibilities of principals is to &ldquo;encourage the involvement of parents&rdquo;.  Parental involvement in schools is extremely important.  It is happening to a much more significant extent than previously was the case.  That has generally been beneficial for schools and individual pupils.  If parents have a serious interest in the education of their children, the individual child will almost always benefit.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a problem that can arise in this regard.  Some parents are so wrapped up in their own children that they cannot look at the broader picture.  It is important that certain lines are not crossed when parents get involved in schools.  Specifically, parents should not interfere in how classes are run and indiscipline is dealt with.  When I worked as a teacher, I dealt with the case of a child who had to be suspended for a few days, unfortunately, but was brought to school by his father on the first day of the suspension.  I pointed out to him that the decision to suspend his child had been taken by the board of management rather than by me, but he insisted on his child staying in the school.  It led to quite a difficult situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
      <P>It was but legal threats had to be made before that happened.  It is sometimes difficult for parents to understand that rules apply to their children as much as they do to everybody else&rsquo;s children.  Perhaps some guidance might be given in this area.</P>
      <P>I have to admit that when I worked as a teacher, most of my colleagues seemed to view the Teaching Council as no more than an organisation that looked for &euro;90 from us every year.  Those of us who had been teaching for a while wondered why the establishment of the council was necessary.  Any teacher who has a permanent position in a school will have completed a period of probation and will have received an official stamp, in a sense, from the Department of Education and Skills stating that he or she is qualified.  I do not see why the Department <Col N="640" />cannot maintain a list of such teachers.  Perhaps the Minister&rsquo;s intention is that the Teaching Council will have other responsibilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan">
      <NameTxt>Deputy John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a couple of points in support of this technical Bill, which amends the Education Act 1998 and the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Before I raise a few issues, I should mention that like most Deputies who are present, I have worked as a teacher in the past.  I ended up working as an unqualified mathematics and science teacher by accident.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In the early years of the last decade I was a teacher for a short period to cover maternity leave.  While I enjoyed the work I discovered that teaching was not for me.  I echo some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Dowds in his comments about the issues concerning the appointment, suspension, dismissal and redeployment of teachers.  Certain individuals are not cut out for the job of teaching even though they are teachers.  I was in the happy position of covering a six-month maternity leave and I could walk away but many individuals are not happy in their work and this is transmitted to their students.  There needs to be a mechanism for dealing with this situation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dowds regarding the role of boards of management in the issues of suspension and dismissal of teachers.  I served on the board of management of my local national school for a number of years.  In most communities, the parents, staff and members of the board of management of the school are part of that local community.  They are in daily contact with one another.  It can be very difficult for any board member to have to deal with the question of suspension or dismissal of a teacher who is a friend or neighbour.  I agree with Deputy Dowds&rsquo;s suggestion of providing for input from departmental inspectors in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have two issues of concern which I wish to raise and to which Deputy Lawlor referred in his contribution.  The last day of February marked the date for a large number of retirements from the public service and many teachers in particular.  It is imperative that temporary teaching positions and cover for maternity leave or illness, should not be provided to retired teachers rather than to young, unemployed qualified teachers of which there are very many.  As mentioned by Deputy Lawlor, they are looking for teaching experience but they are unable to obtain a post because up to now these positions were being filled by retired teachers.  This is not appropriate and the Minister has issued circulars to this effect but he needs to reiterate this message.</P>
      <P>My final issue relates to the Teaching Council.  In advance of the referendum campaign I was canvassing last Saturday in Piltown, in south County Kilkenny, which Deputy Mattie McGrath will know well as it is near Carrick-on-Suir.  I met a woman who has been teaching for more than 20 years.  Through no fault of her own, she missed the deadline by a day or two for her payment of the &euro;90 fee to the Teaching Council, to which Deputy Dowds referred.  As a consequence, she must now wait to be vetted and will be charged an increased fee in order to be included on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s list.  In my view, it is a peculiar system.  If she had applied a day earlier, she would not be required to be vetted.  She has worked as a teacher for 20 years and is a highly qualified, successful and good teacher.  The vetting process will take a number of months in her case and in my view it seems draconian, to say the least.  Everybody acknowledges the necessity for vetting of people who deal with children but this person has <Col N="641" />worked successfully as a teacher for over 20 years.  I hope similar situations will not arise.  I hope the Minister will take up the suggestion made by Deputy Dowds with regard to departmental inspectors helping boards of management to deal with difficult decisions relating to the suspension and dismissal of teachers.  It is a very worthy suggestion that deserves to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Education Act 1998 and the Teaching Council Act 2001. There are many good aspects to the Bill but I also have some serious concerns.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for amendment of the definition of &ldquo;support services&rdquo; in section 2 of the Education Act 1998.  It clarifies that speech therapy services in primary schools will be provided by the HSE, as has been the position.  However, it is very difficult to access these speech therapy services and the HSE is a difficult organisation to deal with.  While there are many good people working in the HSE, it is difficult to access the services it provides for children in national school, including dental treatments in any form.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides for a revised text of sections 23 and 24 of the Education Act 1998 to provide for the suspension and dismissal of teachers, and the redeployment of teachers, including principal teachers and other staff in accordance with procedures put in place by the Minister following consultation with the education partners and other Ministers.  I question how this will work in practice because I thought the Croke Park agreement was meant to deal with such issues.  The matter will be required to be dealt with by the Minister and also by the Minister with responsibility for public service reform.  In my view this will be a very cumbersome procedure and it is a concern.  In my view, the Croke Park agreement was negotiated with the trade unions.  I do not wish to see anyone being bullied or moved unnecessarily but there needs to be flexibility in the procedures.</P>
      <P>This section of the Bill also makes provision for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001 and if the school continues to look for registered teachers in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I ask what is the role of the Teaching Council.  Teachers who have contacted me are very concerned.  Deputy John Paul Phelan referred to a case where a teacher was a day late in registering with the Teaching Council and was forced to wait for Garda vetting.  This is a nonsensical situation.  The Teaching Council is taking in more than &euro;5 million a year in registration fees.  This system needs to be reformed and revisited.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides for the repeal of section 32 of the Education Act 1998 and will have the effect of abolishing the Educational Disadvantage Committee, while its work is to be commended over the past years.  Educational disadvantage and social disadvantage are significant issues.  I refer in particular to Traveller children and I commend the efforts of teachers, social workers and others who help with the inclusion in the system of Traveller children.  This section of society has significant needs but now this committee has been abolished with the stroke of a pen.  Efforts must be made to help young Travellers take advantage of education and to better understand their culture.  All cultures must be respected and understood by all sides of society.  I was involved with some of the projects organised by the Educational Disadvantage Committee in south Tipperary and I compliment Ms O&rsquo;Connor who worked in this area for many years and great results have been achieved.  Young people must be engaged in order to encourage them to interact better with others.  I do not mean that the Traveller culture should be changed rather that young Travellers can be better able to adapt to other cultures such as ours.  I have been a member of a board of management of a national school and also on the boards of management of both a secondary school and a VEC college.  I have noted the number of different cultures in schools, with children from eastern Europe and beyond.  These newcomers are welcome.  However, if we cannot integrate our own ethnic Traveller community and its culture, there is something wrong.</P>
      <Col N="642" />
      <P Just="Left">Section 8 provides for the Minister&rsquo;s powers of approval regarding teachers&rsquo; appointments.  I have sat on interview boards and I am aware that some situations may be resolved by arbitration which can sometimes take a number of years. These can be costly and intimidating experiences for lay people who are involved.</P>
      <P>Section 11 repeals the Scientific and Educational (Investment) Fund Act 1997 and the Scientific and Educational (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Act 1998.   That is a worry because we must change our ways at primary school level also and adapt to changing times, society and work practices and the competition we face in bringing in high-tech multinational companies.  I, along with other members of the Technical Group, had the opportunity to have lunch with the American ambassador recently, although it was not the first time I had met him.  I had met him two years ago at a conference in Galway.  University College Galway has very good links with the scientific industry in Galway and has a good name but at that time, the chief executive officer of one of the major companies addressed us and said the standard of science graduates, including biology graduates, had seriously slipped.</P>
      <P>I deliberately discussed this with the ambassador&rsquo;s aides who understand the situation from the point of view American direct investment in Ireland.  They said that when American companies invest here, they must bring in graduates from Europe and elsewhere.  That is not much good to the unemployed graduates from Ireland.  There is a problem here which needs to be examined and dealt with very quickly.  We all know how long it takes to produce a graduate.  It takes so many years in secondary school, so many years in college and so on.  However, there is a problem which must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Something has gone wrong with the education system because we had a name for having the best educated graduates and that is why some of these businesses came here.  I could not believe that if companies invest here, they must bring in graduates from Europe.  Even though they would prefer to employ Irish graduates, they are not of the required standard.  I am not blaming the graduates but there is a problem which must be examined and addressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has left the Chamber, which is a pity, but I have serious concerns about the thrust of education, especially in respect of the religious ethos.  I thank the religious orders &mdash; the nuns, the priests and the brothers &mdash; for the valuable role they have played in education since the foundation of the State.  There were some problems, which we cannot deny.  They were horrific and I condemn them out of hand but are we going to throw the baby out with the bath water?</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister&rsquo;s agenda.  I believe he has a personal agenda here, because of his own beliefs or non-beliefs, to remove the religious from schools.  I object strenuously to that.  It is a bad, nasty and an unfair move and it does not respect the millions of hours of education provided to under-privileged and ordinary people, which are still being provided by the religious in some cases.</P>
      <P>I have always made the point about sisters, whether matrons of hospitals, school principals or whatever, that they are totally dedicated to their jobs.  I have served with them on school boards.  They do not have the distraction of family or otherwise and they are totally dedicated and well qualified.  I have sat on interview boards with many sisters and I learned much from them because they are very experienced and very understanding and I pay tribute to them, including the Sisters of Mercy in my own town of Cahir and in all the towns of south Tipperary.  I have children in national school, in secondary school and in third level.  I have sat on boards, so I have a small bit of education.  I am not saying I am qualified but I am willing to learn.  I learn something every day.</P>
      <Col N="643" />
      <P>However, I am worried about the Minister&rsquo;s intention to banish these people, given the rich heritage they provided us with and the legacy they left us.  It cannot be written out of history because of problems or the beliefs which any Minister may have.  I am very concerned about that and I am willing to fight the Minister at every crossroads because it is wrong.</P>
      <P>I refer to teacher numbers in small schools, which is a major issue.  I admire the Minister for twice admitting since the budget that he made a mistake.  We can all make mistakes, we make them every day.  My motto is that the man or woman who never made a mistake never made anything.</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted his mistake with the DEIS schools.  Was that because so many DEIS schools are in the cities, in particular in Dublin?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and the Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and others lobbied him on behalf of DEIS schools.  That is where the real lobbying took place.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, for looking after some of the DEIS schools in his constituency because that is our job in our respective constituencies.</P>
      <P>However, I am very disappointed now that DEIS schools have been dealt with that the Minister wants to write small schools out of history.  I refer to their legacy and the richness of the culture and heritage they provide.  There is one such school in my area, Sceichin A Rince, which the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, God rest him, visited two or three years ago to celebrate its 150 anniversary because he had connections with the parish.  It was an excellent occasion.  That school is the community, as are schools in so many other areas of south Tipperary and west Waterford.  We no longer have the pub, the post office, the health centre, the Garda stations and the community facilities and the creameries are long gone.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The school is the essence of the community.  It educates the children.  Small is wonderful.  Big is not as wonderful as we thought.  We found that out to our cost in many areas.  The teachers in small schools have a real opportunity, which they use, and they are doing excellent work as are the families, boards of management, parents&rsquo; councils and the wider community.  It is a family. There is also a closeness to nature.  The pupils are not in big concrete buildings with concrete yards.  There is nature in the playgrounds and they understand a little bit about flora and fauna and do many excellent projects in that regard.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from a lady who moved to my constituency from Finland, although I do not have it with me today.  We are always being told about the Finnish experience and how good it is.  She came to Newtown in the south east part of my constituency quite close to Piltown, to which Deputy John Paul Phelan referred.  I refer to the excellent work the principal, Breda FitzGerald, does along with her co-staff in the small school in Newtown.  The school faces the threat of losing a teacher.  They were pleased with the pupil-teacher ratio in the budget but there was a nasty attack around the back.  It was like sticking a knife in the back because we have now found out that many other changes must be adopted.  This will not work.</P>
      <P>It is like the waste water, or the septic tank, legislation.  This is striking at a nerve of rural Ireland.  Two years ago the then Minister conducted research on the value of these small schools, including Sceichin A Rince.  Has that been shredded, or is it in a box under a desk in some office?  Why do we ask people to engage in consultation?  Today, the Minister the Environment, Community and Local Government announced consultation on waste water, even though the Bill has been signed by the President.  It is a sham and tokenism.</P>
      <P>Why did we have consultation two years ago about the value of these schools?  People, including the parents&rsquo; councils, parents, boards of management, teachers and the clergy from both denominations, who are patrons of most of the schools, fed into it, were passionate and were honest.  Will that consultation be discarded and will we close these schools by stealth because they will not have the numbers?</P>
      <Col N="644" />
      <P>Last week we were told there would be a review provided there were seven extra pupils.  Who knows whether there will be in a community denuded of jobs and industry?  We must keep rural Ireland alive.  While there is blood in my body, I will fight for rural Ireland because I know the value of it.  It is not all about the cities and the towns.</P>
      <P>The parish priest says Mass once a month in that school, Sceichin A Rince, because there is no church in the parish.  Plays, public meetings, community alert meetings and flower shows are held in the school.  It is the community.  If there is a public meeting about domestic water, or boil water notices as there have been for the past two years, that is where it is held.</P>
      <P>That was where I attended a meeting with 100 people.  There was nowhere else because that is the community for so many reasons.  It is a wonderful community.</P>
      <P>The shop is closed because they bypassed the village and the NRA and the council would not allow them to put up a sign on the motorway indicating that fuel and other services were available.  They steamrolled through and are trying to kill them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It was a leap day yesterday and I saw one lady proposing to a man in this building.  I love to see it but I am too old for that and I am already married anyway.  How will a farmer in a relationship get a woman to settle down on the farm with him?  It does not matter whether she is from the country or from the city.  Many of the city women have been top class.  There will be no school there, which is basic.  If they get together, they will want to procreate and we want to keep our communities alive.  How can we do it if they do not have schools?  They have nothing.  They must travel and the buses, which are prohibitively costly, are fast disappearing.  Free education, introduced under Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, is long gone.  They want to take away the services provided by buses and there must be a minimum of ten pupils in order to retain a bus.  There are huge bureaucratic systems, with reviews by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the soundings by the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly.  A review of school buses was carried out in 2000 and queried why they are parked from 10 a.m. to 2.45 a.m.  All buses should be used, including those used for daycare centres.  There are major savings to be made.  I welcome that because we need to have rural schools, services and buses.  Otherwise, people will not settle in the country.  Will we have afforestation and close the gates on rural Ireland?  This attack on rural schools must be fought, will be fought and is being fought.  I have had a number of public meetings.  I compliment the teachers on the effort they make.  Together, we &mdash; the boards of management, the National Parents Council Primary and families &mdash; stand while the Department of Education and Skills wants to divide and conquer.  It is not right, fair or proper.  This is a massive issue in rural Ireland and must be dealt with.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In fairness to previous governments, there was massive investment in education and the national road network.  It affected 80% of the schools in my constituency as they saw huge investment in the past number of years.  This applies to two-teacher, three-teacher and four-teacher schools, which did better than the bigger schools, which are under real pressure with five teachers.  People in Cahir town have been waiting for decades for a new school to replace the old school, which is a Dickensian building.  Small schools did very well and they are all fabulous and new.  In many cases, they were short money to finish them but the community dug deep through fundraising such as charity walks and table quizzes.  This made up the money for extra elements that could not be funded by the Department.  This is the way it should be as these people are the enablers in every community.  We want to educate our children to be the enablers to keep Ireland alive, to grow up to be entrepreneurs and to educate themselves so they have confidence and respect for themselves, their communities and the country.  We cannot kill off that off by sending them to towns and cities.  I am not anti-town or anti-city but what is out there in the community is wonderful and has served us well for generations.  <i>To <Col N="645" />School Through The Fields</i> by Alice Taylor is lovely reading and evokes lovely memories.  It is wonderful to go past the school yard and to hear children playing.  There is nothing worse than seeing derelict schools with crows and jackdaws flying in and out of the windows.  After investing in this, and sending out a consultation document three years ago on the value, quality and justification for small schools, the Department wants to close them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We had a drastic clean out of the politicians last year but we had no clean out of the mandarins in the Departments, who should have been cleaned out years ago.  They are stale, tired and lethargic and they do not listen to people.  They are all-powerful people to whom we cannot talk, even though there are some people doing good work.  Those people need to be cleaned out and shaken up and come to understand the issue by visiting the schools at break times and during class time to see the valuable work going on, the interaction between teachers and the love they have for their vocation.  They should see the way families come in and out with their children and the interaction and various extracurricular events such as sport, sc&oacute;r and sl&oacute;gadh, which are part of our heritage that must be taught.  The mandarins do not want to know and they want to kill us off completely.  They want to turn off the lights in rural Ireland.  It will be critical if they do it to the schools, which are our future and must be preserved and enhanced.</P>
      <P>It is utter folly to talk about closing them after spending such massive amounts of money.  Part of it was raised from taxpayers&rsquo; money and from charity walks and bungee jumps.  It is daft and the mandarins need to wake up.  The Minister would be better off rooting that out of the system than tackling the religious denominations that provided such service to schools in the past.  The Minister should see where the problems are rather than, as this Government is in the habit of doing, going after the wrong people and blaming the ordinary people of rural Ireland, attacking them and squeezing the lifeblood out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Durkan.  While I broadly welcome the terms of the Education (Amendment) Bill, certain provisions are lacking and I am glad to air my views.  The Teaching Council of Ireland was established by statute in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession at primary and post-primary levels, to promote the professional development of teachers and to regulate standards in our profession.  In light of our severe economic climate and the resulting cuts that need to be made in the education budget, it is prudent that the Minister explores the possibility of subsuming the Teaching Council into the Department of Education and Skills.  Due to economic restraints, England subsumed its teaching council into the English Department for Education and there is real merit to this approach.  As an ex-principal and a teacher, I had many discussions with teachers regarding the effectiveness and dividend on the ground provided by the Teaching Council and I strongly urge that this be explored.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Teaching Council of Ireland employees 24 full-time employees and is housed in Maynooth.  Teachers pay a &euro;90 registration fee and there are roughly 73,000 teachers registered, which equates to a &euro;6.57 million annual income.  Is this necessary?  Making registration conditional on the successful completion of continual professional development must be welcomed.  This requirement is standard in other professions such as nursing and doctors.  I would welcome further detail from the Minister on the matter.  For example, who will be providing this training and who will be paying for it?  Will the training be provided by the education centres, the INTO, the teacher training colleges or the universities?  In the interests of clarity and fairness, I ask the Minister to make this information available as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to explore, along with the training colleges, the possibility of introducing an interview process for teacher student candidates prior to admittance to college.  Good teachers must have excellent communication and people skills.  We must ensure the right people qualify and ultimately have a long and fulfilling career in the education sector.  In Finland, <Col N="646" />students are tested through interview for communication skills, willingness to learn, academic ability and motivation for teaching.  Focus must be placed on ensuring that students have the right skills and aptitude for teaching.  Interviewing prospective students is in the interest of potential teachers, students and State resources.  As an ex-principal, I have seen teachers come through the system who are not able to cope with the social, emotional and educational demands of teaching.  Sadly, after three years of teacher training, they find out that teaching is not for them.  I urge the Minister to examine the Hibernia College model and use it in the other teacher training colleges.  These individuals often diversify into another field and their teacher training is a lost resource.  It results in the individual teacher being frustrated and hindered in his or her development and the loss of State resources.</P>
      <P>The lack of males in the teaching profession also needs to be addressed.  The CSO women and men in Ireland report 2011 indicated the teaching profession is 73.3% female.  Undoubtedly, this has a negative impact on children as many lack the influence of positive male role models.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to the other element of speech and language services addressed in the Bill, I ask the Minister to explore possible methods of providing speech and language services to children in their own school environment.  This would ease pressure on parents significantly and, more importantly, children would lose fewer hours of teaching time due to appointments.</P>
      <P>Finally, I welcome the confirmation the Minister provided that vocational education committees will be reformed.  I strongly urge the Minister to examine the make-up of the VEC boards.  There are far too many political appointments to them.  Furthermore, I encourage the Minister to investigate the possibility of imposing a voluntary model, similar to that in primary schools, on these boards.  The volunteering role of people serving on primary school boards and voluntary secondary schools is one that should be replicated across the education system.  The buck stops at the Minister&rsquo;s desk and I ask that expenses be reduced for VECs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to share time.  This is a huge issue and one which requires more than the amount of time available to us.  I cannot but compliment my colleague on her constructive comments from an educational viewpoint. </P>
      <P Just="Left">I cannot refrain from commenting on the points made by Deputy Mattie McGrath, some of which I agree with and some of which I profoundly disagree with.  He referred to the fabric of rural society and the need to retain it.  He is absolutely right about that.  He referred to education, health, crime control, justice and Garda stations.  It is the duty of everybody to recognise the necessity to provide for the maximum application of backup support and services to all areas, urban and rural, throughout the country to ensure even in the current difficult circumstances we try to retain the maximum level of competence and support to ensure citizens are treated reasonably equally.  That is important.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath also referred to protecting the interests of the people of Ireland and septic tanks.  That has nothing to do with education.  I cannot for the life of me understand how he can claim that opposition to the improvement of septic tanks is in the interests of people living in rural Ireland.  The reverse is the case.  The only thing that can happen with malfunctioning septic tanks throughout rural Ireland is that a lower quality of water supply will be available to people dependent on private water supplies.  I do not know from where the Deputy is coming.  The more the level of pollution in ground water is raised, the less likely it will be that people will be able to survive in rural Ireland the future.  That is a fact and I defer to nobody on it.</P>
      <Col N="647" />
      <P>As time goes by education, like everything else, needs to be reformed in line with the requirements of the modern era.  I am sure some of the reforms will be seen in some quarters as being unnecessary or undesirable.  Some of those proposed by the Minister are certainly desirable.  We have all met constituents, including parents, children and teachers.  Yesterday I met a number of classes and discussed various issues with children from a primary school.  I was quite amazed at the level of perception, intelligence and focus on the issues they see at the periphery of their particular vision.  It was quite interesting, which is as it should be.</P>
      <P>The education system is working.  It should not be isolated from the rest of the economy or community.  It has to be the area wherein the formative years are used to provide the basic grounding that is needed to ensure a child can move from primary to second and third levels and have the best advantage in doing so.</P>
      <P>There are advantages and disadvantages to large and smaller schools, and those in rural and urban areas.  We all want to revert to what we see as best practice.  There are examples of what has worked well in different situations.  People might doubt me, but I am a product of a small school in rural Ireland.  Some say it was a good investment, but others are not so sure.</P>
      <P>The system produced some very fine quality people over the years the length and breadth of the country, and continues to do so.  Even working under the current economic constraints that is still possible.  I would welcome the constructive attempts the Minister has made, despite the very difficult situation, to address the issues that arise in regard to small rural schools.  He has a formula in mind which will work, namely the amalgamation of resources in an area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Towns and cities are different, and one can walk from one school to another.  It is not possible to do that in the country, particularly in sparsely populated areas.  A particular assessment needs to be done of the needs and requirements in rural areas.  A distance of 45 km to a school is not an ideal situation.  Nor is it ideal to have small schools isolated on their own, and expect them to stand alone and free and still enable students to integrate with wider society in the future.  However, modern telecommunications are a feature and factor nowadays and technology can be used to try to ensure integration takes place.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the objectives of the education system many times in the past.  It should focus on the pupil, which is the primary function of education.  How information is brought to the desks of pupils is hugely important.  Modern technology can be used very effectively but it is also important to recognise that we are not all equal in how we do these things.</P>
      <P>For example, in the political arena some are better than others, and some sit on the Front Bench while others do not.  There are variations in the way teachers are able to convey messages to their students.  There is a necessity to observe and recognise strengths and weaknesses within the sector, with a view to ensuring that we play to our strengths.  Some teachers are good communicators in one area but perhaps not in other areas.  We need to make sure we utilise information to the best of our ability.</P>
      <P>There is some concern among local management bodies, which they have expressed to me and, I am sure, others, that no consultation took place with them over the introduction of the Bill.  While I acknowledge there were time constraints and that it was difficult to have consultation, I hope the Minister may find it possible to address the concerns of local management bodies, making particular reference to the need to recognise that the education system, as with every other, is locally based.  Primary education, in particular, is very much locally based and needs the support of the local community.  The local community needs to feel needed and to be part of the system.  Local communities have been very supportive over the years and local boards of management are very much instrumental in the delivery of education and the handling of issues constructively.  Their approach has had and will have a considerable impact on the quality and standard of education.</P>
      <Col N="648" />
      <P Just="Left">The Bill makes special provision for children with special needs.  The need to recognise such needs in the first instance was the subject of a long battle in the House over the years.  It is only in the past 20 years that this issue has begun to emerge.  Considerable numbers of unfortunate children never had their learning difficulties recognised.  There were many battles in the early days on this issue in order to obtain recognition for children in these circumstances.  Like every other Member, I am particularly conscious of the unfortunate circumstances in which some children and their parents found themselves.  The parents sought recognition of the problem that existed and demanded help, diagnosis, back-up and support.  Autism, ADD, ADHD, etc., were not recognised for many years.  I am thankful they are now recognised.</P>
      <P>There is a deficiency regarding the extent to which we can deliver equally to children right across the country.  We have special units in special schools but their number is limited.  This places great stress on the system and the parents, and particularly on the affected children.</P>
      <P>The affected child does not understand that he or she is different or requires different services.  However, understanding begins to emerge over time and children ask pertinent questions at a very early stage.  All parents of children in such circumstances will readily admit this.  The children themselves cannot identify precisely what the issues are, but they gradually emerge.  When a condition is known, it may be too late to address it.  If such a condition is addressed in the first instance, it gives the child a considerable advantage in terms of his being able to cope with life and society.  This applies to every other child.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we recognise a few fundamental points, even in these financially constrained times.  We have an obligation to deliver education of the highest quality and standard to the new generation.  The system needs to be up to date and to be the best available worldwide.  I refer not only to those systems of our nearest neighbours, but also to those of countries worldwide.  We need to achieve quality and excellence that are above and beyond any standard required heretofore.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those educationalists who have, down through the years, passed on the ethos of educating the next generation.  There may be differences of emphasis and ability among educationalists, but it is certain that where an educationalist has a natural vocation and ability to deliver the message and recognise the receptiveness of the pupil, great benefits accrue for the pupil, the pupil&rsquo;s family and the economy.</P>
      <P>I would like a lot more time to go through many aspects of the Bill to which other Members have referred but I do not want to be repetitious.  In the current climate, we need to recognise that we must retain, as best we can, the bulwark of what is required to deliver in the future.  I refer to delivery at every level, including of education.  The same applies to health services, justice, local community services and quality of life.  Quality of life is always affected by economic issues that arise.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the impact of the economic problems could be more severe for those who are less capable of bearing the burden.  I do not concur with the notion that the burden has been borne more by rural people than urban people, or <i>vice versa</i>.  The burden must be borne equally by both communities.  We must always be conscious, irrespective of whether we live in an urban or rural area, of one another&rsquo;s needs.  While we will defend our own entitlements and rights, depending on where we come from, we must also recognise the rights and entitlements of those who do not live in our environment and who may not have some of our advantages.  It is a question of capitalising on the advantages to the best of our ability to help us to work our way out of our current economic circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ClareDaly">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion is part of that on the reform of education.  However, there are much more significant issues than those encompassed by this Bill, including those associated with the need to have patronage examined, the concept of secularisation in education and overall educational standards.  That said, none of the discussions should be divorced from the overall question of resources and investment in education.  To talk about reform in the context of a butchering of funding and inadequate funding really results in a lopsided debate.  If anything, we need more investment in education, particularly in these pressing times for the economy.  Investment would ultimately pay off and be beneficial not just to individuals, but also to society as a whole.</P>
      <P>This Bill mainly deals with redeployment and standards.  With regard to redeployment, there are not many objections from the trade unions, presumably because many of the measures have been agreed under the Croke Park agreement.  The change in circumstances, whereby the Minister must engage in consultation as opposed to having the agreement of the partners, is fine because much of the detailed decision-making ultimately rests with the board and principal of a school.  That is absolutely appropriate.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with two issues in particular, the first of which is the abolition of the Educational Disadvantage Committee and the second of which concerns the Teaching Council.  On the first, the committee has not really been active since 2005.  The Government has argued that its role has largely been taken on by those administering the DEIS programme.  The Irish Federation of University Teachers raised some concerns about that, arguing the arrangement may continue to fuel disadvantage in education.  The retort of the Department, referring to ongoing work on combating disadvantage, must be questioned seriously.  We cannot look at this measure in isolation, particularly given the recent attacks on DEIS schools, which the intervention of parents and teachers has altered.  We must also look at it from the perspective of funding.  Some 3% of the student body at County Dublin VEC have been told they will shoulder 10% of the education cuts.  It is precisely due to the cuts in programmes targeted at disadvantaged young people that they will have to pay that price.</P>
      <P>In order to have a massive leap forward in educational standards and retain young people in education, funding is needed for programmes with smaller classes such as the applied leaving certificate, other junior certificate programmes and schemes allowing Traveller children to participate, as well as the provision of special needs assistants or SNAs.  Schools will have to cut these things, however, so we should re-examine this matter.  The question of dealing with disadvantage must be placed in the larger context of what is happening to SNAs.  I understand that the Minister is even talking about removing parents&rsquo; right of appeal in that regard, which would be absolutely disastrous.  When the Government talks about combating disadvantage and the abolition of VECs being a part of that overall battle, the argument is weakened by attacks on the most disadvantaged young people, including students.</P>
      <P>The role of the Teaching Council has been highlighted in this debate.  The Bill&rsquo;s explanatory memorandum outlines a list of the council&rsquo;s functions and what it is supposed to do.  While I do not wish to be disrespectful, most people would see it as a glorified organisation for vetting teachers by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some would question the need for that organisation to exist as an independent body.  We need to look at its role and what purpose it serves.  In that context, the Bill is a lost opportunity in that it does not really go far enough.  One of the key questions concerns why unemployed and part-time teachers have to fund this body.  The reality in this State is that it is not possible to get a job as a teacher unless one is registered.  The fact that it costs &euro;90 per year, particularly if a person is unemployed, is outrageous.  The fact that over 3,000 people did not re-register last year tells a certain tale.  The figures speak for themselves.</P>
      <Col N="650" />
      <P>The registration fee places an economic burden on people, which is totally unnecessary.  Why are we talking about an annual registration fee?  Why is it not every three or five years?  If it is necessary to register every year, why is there an annual charge?  It seems that the only purpose of this registration is as a revenue generating mechanism.  No other explanation makes any great sense.  The only reason I have heard being advanced is that &ldquo;We need to make it self-financing and get funding for it&rdquo;.  Why should the cost of that self-financing be borne by the teachers themselves, particularly those who are unemployed or part-time, when the employer gains from their professionalism?  The Department of Education and Skills, as the employer, should be funding this service, rather than individual teachers.  If the Department should be funding it, this begs the question as to why the Department cannot do the work itself within its own departmental buildings.  Why do we need a separate premises in Maynooth?  What are the salaries of the top people in the Teaching Council?  We should dig deep on these issues and examine them.  If we are talking about streamlining and, as the Bill states, it is part of an overall cost-saving package, why do we not examine that aspect also?</P>
      <P>In addition, letters sent out by the Teaching Council to its members use full-colour, heavy, embossed, expensive paper.  It is quite incredible.  While I do not know for a fact, I am told that it is of a graphic design character that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is, why do we need to have that?  The Teaching Council sends out receipts and letters to 73,000 people at a minimum postage cost of 55 cent each, not including the cost of the unusually heavy paper.  What is this about?  That is the guts of &euro;40,000 in postage alone.  We can take it that all these teachers are online, so what about the smart economy and using online receipts?  If we are talking about avoiding waste and being more efficient, presumably these functions could be done more smartly than they are at present.  As a result, we could save expense rather than foisting the burden onto teachers, many of whom are jobless.</P>
      <P>In its material, the Teaching Council says that registered teachers can now see themselves as registered professionals similar to doctors, architects, engineers and nurses.  That is nonsense, however.  Teachers are not self-employed sole traders requiring professional indemnity insurance.  They are essentially employees.  The question of continuing professional development is hugely important to them.  They have taken it on board and have had a constant input in that regard.  There is a desire among teachers for an increase in professionalism and for continuous professional development.  That can be done through in-service course programmes and by making the ongoing development of teaching standards compulsory.  There is a real will within the teaching profession, and the teaching community generally, to do that within our education service.  We do not need a teaching council to achieve that.</P>
      <Col N="651" />
      <P>It is important to tackle the issue of casualisation because qualified teachers should not be on the dole when unqualified people are being employed in their jobs.  I know it is said that this can only be done in exceptional circumstances, but I am not sure the Bill will achieve that.</P>
      <P>It is understood that following the commencement of section 30, unregistered persons acting in place of a teacher, even if they are qualified, are likely to be paid at the unqualified rate unless they are registered.  In other words, a financial incentive is being put in here to make people register.  The Department of Education and Skills estimates that up to 10,000 teachers may have to seek registration with the Teaching Council or else face massive pay cuts, potentially to the tune of thousands of euro.  I do not understand the motivation behind this.  Is it to drive another 10,000 teachers into paying over their &euro;90 so the council can get another few bob?  Is it a back-door attempt to cut teaching salaries if people do not register?  I am not sure what it is but I am concerned about cuts in allowances to newly qualified teachers.  I would like the Minister to address this matter in more detail later.</P>

      <P>While we need to examine specific measures in this Bill, the general context in which the legislation is being put forward is depressing due to the cuts in education.  Of course, the Minister and his Government colleagues will throw up their hands and say: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do.  We&rsquo;re in a straitjacket.  We&rsquo;re bankrupt and insolvent, and therefore we&rsquo;ve no choice but to do these things.&rdquo;  I do not accept that in general, however, because it was a political decision of the current Government and its predecessor to prioritise the interests of bankers and speculators, and those who represent them in the EU-IMF, over our society and its citizens.  It is extremely foolish to cut the education sector.  I ask the Minister and the Government to consider this.  While there may well be more, there have already been specific cuts to rural schools.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There has been the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, which will do extreme damage to small schools in rural areas, and a cap on special needs assistants.  Against a background of 10,000 extra pupils joining the school system every year, essentially a demographic timebomb working its way through the education system, these caps, cuts and holding of budgets at current levels will mean a degrading of the quality of education delivered to our young people.  This is at a time when precisely enhancing the quality of and access to education is vital to get us out of the economic mess in which we find ourselves.  Equipping our people to the highest possible level of education and educational standards is the only way we will be able to work our way out of this crisis.  The Government talks about a high-tech and globalised economy.  How that can be achieved is beyond me when the Government is degrading the quality of education available to people by increasing student-staff ratios, capping special needs assistants and cutting school capitation grants.  It just does not add up and will only do extreme damage in the medium to long term.</P>
      <P>The specific issue in this Bill I want to raise is that of unqualified teachers.  I am deeply concerned about this and for that reason, unless the Government reconsiders the Bill&rsquo;s provisions in this regard, I will be voting against it.  The Bill proposes an amendment to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act and to section 24 of the Education Act to allow for the employment of unqualified teachers to fill in for teacher absences.  The Government claims this is not the best solution as it is preferable to have qualified teachers.  It claims there will be all sorts of provisions and protections to ensure qualified teachers will be employed in the first instance to fill gaps for teacher absences.</P>
      <P>This country has mass unemployment and a considerable number of those unemployed are teachers.  In the last week, 1,000 newly qualified teachers looking for employment protested outside the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, for example.  Against this background, I simply do not under<Col N="652" />stand why the Government sees it as important to make provision for unqualified teachers when there are plenty of qualified teachers seeking employment and will be in the future.</P>
      <P>The key way to fill certain absences on occasion is by dealing with the issue of qualified teacher supply.  It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure an adequate number of qualified teachers are available.  With the brutal pay cuts the Government has imposed, along with the removal of the degree allowance, a newly qualified teacher will be coming in at &euro;27,000, approximately &euro;7,000 less than previous entrants.  This will act as a disincentive for people to join the teaching profession and will either drive teachers out of the profession or the country.  Did the Minister know that Abu Dhabi is advertising for English-speaking teachers, of which it has a shortage, on a starting salary of &euro;90,000 per year?  If I were newly qualified teacher and had no ties here, I would strongly consider going to Abu Dhabi, particularly when the Government here imposes pay cuts on newly qualified teachers and does not give a damn about the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Government is degrading the teaching profession and is now opening up a situation where we will rely increasingly on the provision of unqualified teachers.  It is particularly concerning when those unqualified substitutes are paid less.  Whether it is the Government&rsquo;s intention as the pressure for more cuts comes, it may come to rely more on unqualified teachers, resulting in a yellow pack layer of teachers which degrades the quality of our education system.</P>
      <P>The Government claims this provision is simply to cover short-term gaps and absences.  Teachers accept the need for flexibility in addressing these gaps but they are concerned about the possibility of an over-reliance on unqualified teachers with all its implications.  Teachers have proposed that instead of amending the Act, a circular should be issued to allow for supervisors to be employed in extreme circumstances so that unqualified people can supervise a class for a day or two to avoid having to send it home.</P>
      <P>An additional and even better proposal to cover teacher absences would be to re-establish and expand a pilot project which provided supply panels of teachers to service particular clusters of schools.  Such a project was established in 1995 but was abolished, presumably as an austerity measure, in the 2010 budget.  For every 150 teachers in a cluster of schools, there would be four or five supply teachers permanently employed to be deployed to cover absences.  Such a scheme would address the circumstances the Government wishes to address rather than opening the dangerous door to having unqualified teacher levels expand with the consequent threat to our children&rsquo;s quality of education.  Will the Minister consider these suggestions?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that we must examine the costs of the Teaching Council.  However, to claim teachers do not want to register and are complaining about the council is incorrect.  I meet teachers every day and know they are not complaining about it.  If she wants to go on about the quality of the embossed paper or the ink the council issues, she should remember it is the same notepaper we all get.  It is the exact same.  I am in favour of moving to an online system of registration.  Let us deal with the real world.  We have a group of people in staff rooms and classrooms who, under the Croke Park agreement, have changed the landscape of their tenure as teachers.  There has been more movement and flexibility in schools recently than in the previous 25 years.  That is testimony to the teachers who have shown leadership and who continue every day to demonstrate the ability they have in terms of the transmission of education in classrooms.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister, in particular his reform of the VEC sector.  It is important that we give power back locally, amalgamate VECs and allow them to focus on their primary role, namely, to provide local education, training, up-skilling and retraining.  That is at the centre of what their purpose should be.  In recent weeks there has been reference to the VECs in newspapers and in the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have a very good VEC within the city of Cork where the leadership is provided by Mr. Ted Owens, and Mr. Jim Corr, chairperson of the VEC.  I very much look forward to the City of Cork VEC in particular continuing to lead in training and the provision of education.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for changes to speech therapy services, which are to be provided by the HSE.  That is an important aspect of the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Cannon.  The availability of speech therapy services for children requires joined-up thinking to continue by taking a multi-agency approach and a multi-departmental one between the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, social workers and others.  We must protect the vulnerable.  The Minister is getting rid of the Educational Disadvantage Committee.  We are talking about disadvantaged children.  That must also be recognised.  Section 6 deals with the appointment, suspension, dismissal and payment of teachers.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a related issue, namely, the Employment Equality Act, in particular in terms of the possibility of teachers being discriminated against because of their sexuality.  It is important that in the lifetime of the D&aacute;il the Government would amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  It is important that we remove the language contained and its implicit threat of sanction for teachers who may be discriminated against because of their sexuality.  Discrimination cannot be allowed because a person is either married, single, divorced, in a civil partnership or because they are lesbian or gay.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope the Minister will examine the issue in consultation with the relevant line Minister.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that no cases have been brought to date, but it is important that we take on board the work of GLEN, which has been very much to the fore in this regard and has taken a measured approach in its engagement.  I pay tribute to GLEN and its director, Mr. Brian Sheehan, for the way in which the group has campaigned and sought to remove this anomaly which is still part of the architecture of education.  The provision should not exist.  The Minister is amending legislation and the same approach should be taken to section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998.</P>

      <P>Cathal O&rsquo;Riada, a primary school principal in Cork, wrote a moving and informative piece last week in the <i>Cork Independent </i>newspaper.  He referred to the word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; being given back to teachers that they have not enjoyed up to now.  In amending the legislation we would remove the fear based on the constant threat that exists for many teachers and we would allow them to be human without the fear of discrimination.  The Government and the previous one have made huge strides with the civil partnership Bill, the Finance (No. 2) Bill and the Finance (No. 3) Bill, which is due to be introduced.  It is important that we would continue the work.</P>
      <P>Deputies Clare Daly and Richard Boyd Barrett referred to unqualified teachers and other personnel.  I very much welcome the approach taken by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  Deputy Finian McGrath is present.  He, too, would be aware of what it is like to be in a classroom.  It is not always easy to get a qualified person on a Monday or Wednesday morning.  At times, principals can struggle to get qualified teachers.  I very much subscribe to the view that we must allow newly qualified people to become engaged in the profession, to seek employment, to be given experience and to be employed.  I would love to see a 100% employment record of qualified people.  That is what we must aspire to achieve.</P>
      <P>I live in the real world but some of the people opposite seem to live in a parallel world.  They are for nothing and against everything.  They come to the House with no proposal.  I do not refer to Deputy Finian McGrath.  Let them come into the real world &mdash; go into staff rooms and principals&rsquo; offices and deal with the issues affecting them every single day.  It is very easy to come to the House and cry every day, but one must come up with solutions.  One must make practical, responsible suggestions that will get this country moving.</P>
      <P>We are faced with campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in a referendum.  I challenge Deputy Finian McGrath and his colleagues opposite to be responsible and to put people first rather their vested electoral interests.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Finian McGrath is well aware, the architecture of teaching has changed.  We must focus on the delivery of good education by qualified teachers.  That is why professional development and in-service training is important.  We must not use the recession as a means to dilute that.  I challenge the Ministers in the Department to come up with an adventurous and ambitious plan for the professional development of teachers.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of school management and in tandem with the boards of management, principals, VECS, teachers and parents, there is a requirement on us to examine the education system.  Perhaps it is time we had another Green Paper or White Paper on education.  I commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will refer to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in his absence.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I wish to address some of the issues that are important to me.  The Minister has a task relative to the content of the first document in the State, which is the Proclamation by the leaders of 1916.  As Members are aware, they all came from different backgrounds, creeds, ideologies and life experiences.  The first line of the third paragraph of the Proclamation declares that the Irish people have a right to the ownership of Ireland.  That was nearly lost by the actions of the previous Government with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, when one takes banking issues into account.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s debate is on education and I wish to place on record my support for the Government&rsquo;s policy on education and the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship.  I record my admiration for the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the manner in which <Col N="655" />they addressed the issues of SNAs and DEIS schools.  The people were directly addressed, their views were listened to and taken into account.  The Minister was prepared to review the situation and to change his mind.  Far from being a weakness, that is a great strength in a human being.  I welcome that all teachers must be registered and that supervision and standards in education must be adhered to.  The Bill is a significant step towards achieving these aims, particularly during times of difficult economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>The House, the Government and the Minister are rightly motivated by the well being of children, their education and their cultural, social and spiritual needs.  Through the Minister and his Department, we hand over responsibility to the thousands of teachers in our system at preschool, primary, secondary, adult and tertiary level.  Almost 1 million children and students are in full-time formal education, accounting for 23% of the population.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, face the difficulty of making provision for a further 70,000 children.  Our economic crisis, which saw the previous Government put our independence in peril, will only result in success if our education system can meet the demands of society, the expectations of individuals and the needs of industry.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a little cynicism about the previous Government&rsquo;s performance in education because all it did was throw money at the sector.  However, a great deal of evidence shows there was minimal long-term strategic planning.  When the current Minister, the Minister of State and other Ministers travel to other countries for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations, they will formally and informally meet hundreds of Irish people who have moved abroad and set up homes and families and will be celebrating their Irishness.  Many of the people living outside Ireland would love to return home for one reason, namely, our education system.  The pride we all feel in it is directly linked to teachers.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that we have problems in the education field.  He inherited them.  A major problem in the system and in society at large is that of literacy.  This issue is close to my heart, having spent a number of years as director of a voluntary adult literacy group.  A long time ago, a man told me that I needed to take into account what it was like for him as a father and neighbour to walk into a post office and not be able to find his way about, be it filling out a postal order or sending registered mail.  I appeal to the Minister of State to examine this issue and to determine what plans can be implemented to address this major problem.</P>
      <P>Last year, I raised with the Minister an issue that was causing difficulty for many parents, namely, school principals writing to families requiring them to make voluntary contributions.  Added to this is the expense of books, photocopying, uniforms etc.</P>

      <P>For some time, I have been involved in addressing the major issues of obesity, bullying, suicide and self-harm.  Deputy Finian McGrath has taken an active interest in the latter two issues.  Sport needs support and development, although investment in equipment is not a significant need.  Recently, Senator Eamonn Coghlan started a plan for every school.  I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinions on it.</P>
      <Col N="656" />
      <P>Also recently I had an opportunity to meet the teachers of a school in my constituency, the Archbishop Ryan senior national school in Balgaddy.  They are committed to the challenges facing the school, which is in the heart of a developing and, in the opinion of some, very needy community.  Their principal, Mr. John Ring, and their INTO representative, Ms Siobhan Kelly, outlined to me with all of the teachers present the challenges they face on a daily basis.  Given the fact that more than 70% of the school&rsquo;s children are international students, the teaching of language is a particular demand.</P>
      <P>The following day I met the principal of the adjoining Archbishop Ryan junior national school, where Ms Marie Mullen, her staff and some 200 children in prefabs are facing the challenges of the economic downturn.  The teachers are not only providing an excellent education service, but a wonderful developmental service for the children from the new community in Balgaddy to help them integrate into Ireland, to become culturally aware of Ireland and to accommodate their different cultural and linguistic backgrounds into the Irish curriculum.</P>
      <P>These are a sample of the 40 schools in my constituency of Dublin Mid West.  I also met the board of management of St. Mary&rsquo;s school in Saggart recently.  It is a two-site school with two special needs classes.  I was overwhelmed and impressed by the standard of teaching and the dedication of the board.  The school is facing serious challenges.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give further attention to the topic of adult education, which is the key to our economic recovery?  For example, Collinstown Park Community College in Clondalkin and the Inchicore College of Further Education provide retraining for adults who are changing careers.  Such people need the support of the education system.  I hope that, in the Government&rsquo;s lifetime, the Minister and his Department will be able to meet this challenge and allow people to play their part in our national recovery.  I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute on this important debate.  The Bill sets out to reform our education system and is concerned with better service delivery and wiser spending.  A good, efficient teaching service needs top quality teachers, first and foremost.  Give me a good teacher, and the debate on resources, procedures, accountability and reform will follow.  Treating skilled teachers as a priority is the way to improve the education system.</P>
      <P>The teaching profession will always need people who want to be teachers and enjoy working with young people.  One can have all of the points and degrees one wants, but one must love the day job, get a buzz out of it, like children and have certain professional standards to be a good teacher.  These are the people who will deliver front line education.</P>
      <P>The good news is that Ireland has many such teachers.  During my time as the principal of a disadvantaged school, I saw young and fantastic teachers barely a wet week out of college turn around junior and senior infant classes in a matter of months.  Standards improved and poor children made great progress in terms of literacy and numeracy.  This can be done by the right person in the right place even against the odds.  It shows what can be done when the right people are on the front line.</P>
      <P>For this reason, I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s recent decision to continue supporting DEIS schools.  I was annoyed and disappointed by the original decision on the cuts but I was glad the Minister was prepared to listen to teachers, parents and Deputies from multiple parties who campaigned on the issue.  In the assessment, the DEIS schools proved that they had made a difference in disadvantaged communities.  If one improves numeracy and literacy levels among students in disadvantaged schools, one saves money in the long term by preventing young people from getting involved in crime.  Numeracy and literacy problems are a fact of life among <Col N="657" />the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison.  The low self-esteem that started at junior infants led them down the route of crime.  I have spoken to many prisoners and ex-prisoners about this issue.  We have to invest wisely in early education.  I challenge any economist to present evidence that such investment does not offer value for money over the longer term.</P>
      <P>The Bill abolishes the Educational Disadvantage Committee, provides for the employment of unregistered teachers in limited circumstances, clarifies the support services offered to school children and gives the Minister greater powers in deciding procedures for appointment, redeployment and dismissal of teachers.  The Bill also repeals the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Acts.</P>
      <P>We must be careful in addressing the Educational Disadvantage Committee issue and resources must be provided at the earliest opportunity.  The debate on DEIS revealed many examples of good practice in disadvantaged schools.  The delegations who met the Minister and Government backbenchers were convincing because they had delivered in their schools.</P>
      <P>Poor children deserve quality teachers.  A good teacher will always listen to the concerns of his or her pupils and is prepared to broaden his or her mind.  It is sometimes the case that teachers who might not meet the highest standards end up in disadvantaged areas.  We should target trainee teachers who want to work in disadvantaged areas.  I made the choice to work for 27 years in a school in a disadvantaged area.  Every time I meet a group of students from Marino college, 10% to 15% want the challenge of teaching in a disadvantaged school.  They should be encouraged with the best of support and guidance.</P>
      <P>I would love to see Mandarin being taught in Ireland because our future economic development will be based on our relationship with China.  If we can teach Spanish or French, why can we not teach Mandarin?  However, we should not overload the curriculum by reforming the system.  Reform should be based on sound educational or economic reasons.  It is a pity Deputy Buttimer is no longer in the Chamber because I would like him to consider the idea I have just suggested.  By including Mandarin in the curriculum now, we can reap the benefits in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the definition of &ldquo;support services&rdquo; provided in section 2 of the Education Act 1998 to clarify the position on the delivery of speech therapy and other health and personal services to students of school-going age.  It also provides for the consequential repeal of sections 7(5) and 7(6) of the Act.  We must be prepared to invest in speech therapy and other support services to ensure they meet the highest standards.  Young children with speech problems and disabilities are often highly proficient in other areas.  Good teachers will zoom in on the positive qualities displayed by their pupils before dealing with the areas in need of support.  A great number of well-known people in this country experienced speech problems when they were in primary school.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the abolition of the Educational Disadvantage Committee.  This measure requires a broader debate because I am aware from working in a disadvantaged school that there are different levels of disadvantage.  Extreme levels of educational disadvantage are apparent in cases where children come to school hungry from environments associated with domestic violence and drugs.  Four year old children who see their mothers being beaten up every night are expected to act normally when they come into the classroom the following morning.  Other children are disadvantaged because their parents are unemployed or are low-paid workers, but they nonetheless benefit from the stable environment of a happy and safe family.  The extreme forms of disadvantage must take priority when it comes to funding.  We cannot sit on the fence in respect of this issue.  One should not expect a four year old child to be normal after witnessing violent acts committed by somebody who is souped up on cocaine.</P>
      <Col N="658" />
      <P>The bad news is that a significant number of children have to endure such an environment but the good news is that the DEIS schemes allow schools to deal with their problems constructively.  For some of these students, the only part of the day when they are happy is while they are in school.  Some Members may find that difficult to believe but five hours of school can be heaven for children from dysfunctional or violent families.  I have seen cases where children had to be thrown out of school in the evening after finishing their after-school projects in music, sports and computing.</P>
      <P>If the resources are slim, we have to invest them in the most needy sections of society.  Other areas can suffer cuts for a while.  I welcome the decision on DEIS schools but it is important that we keep our eyes on the ball because education has to be part of the strategy for reducing crime and increasing economic activity.  We have to deal with the banks, the financial crisis and the European issue, but we also have to provide for education.  Most people who work in economic and social development are aware of that reality.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the Education Act 1998 to allow for employment in certain exceptional and limited circumstances of persons who are not registered teachers under sections 6 and 8.  As a former school principal I have had the experience of getting a phone call at 8 a.m. on a Monday to be informed the school would be short one teacher and being unable to find a qualified teacher.  Plan B is usually an experienced substitute who can deal with a class and is good with children but might not necessarily have the academic qualifications.  There were times when such people got me out of a hole as a principal and dealt with the class very efficiently.  Some of those people, if they had the extra qualification, would make excellent teachers.  While we need to able to deal with that, we also need standards and regulation.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the appointment, suspension, dismissal and redeployment of teachers and other staff in accordance with procedures determined by the Minister following consultation with the education partners.  We need the people who like the day job, get on well with children and have the required professional standards.  In any job people can have personal issues and teachers with personal problems should always be shown the maximum compassion and support.  However, there should also be a strategy as addressed in this section to ensure the children in the class do not suffer.  The bottom line is that we want to have professional people and standards.  Above all we want the right people working in the job.</P>
      <P>The issue of educational disadvantage is important.  There is a pool of young teachers who with the right direction and leadership could be appointed to disadvantaged schools and do great work as many have done in the past.</P>
      <P>The Bill clarifies that the HSE is responsible for the delivery of speech therapy in schools.  Section 2 of the Education Act 1998 makes speech therapy a statutory function of the Minister for Education and Skills.  However, the HSE is the statutory body for the delivery of health services and its Vote includes funding to provide therapy services to children of school-going age.  According to the Department of Education and Skills this created an anomaly which has caused confusion for parents and professionals.  To reflect a clear separation of functions, the Bill seeks to provide a clear separation of functions between the Department and the HSE.  This issue needs to be resolved because when it comes to speech therapy we need to get in there &mdash; we do not need talks about talks and do not need issues falling between two different bureaucratic systems.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Some of these educational issues are covered under the Croke Park agreement.  A number of Government Deputies have recently been jumping up and down about that agreement, but much reform is taking place.  I used an example last week in the D&aacute;il.  In the past seven months St. Michael&rsquo;s House has taken a hit of &euro;950,000 through reforms in the services.  So we should <Col N="659" />not slag off staff and people who are making efforts to improve the services for children with disabilities while at the same they are experiencing staff reductions.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week when discussing the retirements of a number of our colleagues, we touched on the need for a good quality public servant.  A teacher needs to regard his or her role as a public servant.  Teachers are paid by the public and work for the public.  For approximately ten years that ethos disappeared in the greedy jockeying and we lost that old-fashioned professional ethic.  I make no apology for saying that the idea of public service is very important.  I have met many student teachers in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Marino some of whom have a special interest in special needs, some who want to get into highly academic schools &mdash; good luck to them &mdash; and others who want to work in disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>I have served on many school boards of management.  The roles of parents, patrons, teachers and other staff need to reflect modern society and I support reform in that area.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Teaching Council are to promote teaching as a profession; to promote professional development; to maintain a register of teachers &mdash; more than 73,000 teachers are on the register of teachers; to maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers; and to maintain and improve standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence.  I started my contribution today dealing with the importance of competence, knowledge and skills given that Irish society is changing so rapidly.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that among young people the demand for teaching careers is relatively high.  I would like to see more gender balance.  There are high levels of satisfaction among the general public with teachers.  However, that does not mean we do not need to up our game and teachers should be willing to take their fair share of criticism in order to improve their performance.  We need to improve teacher induction and professional development.  We also need to recognise we have a good group who are up for change and are valued.</P>
      <P>There are concerns about the image and status of teaching and teachers often feel their work is undervalued.  When I was the principal in a disadvantaged school that was highlighted to me by a number of young teachers in the school.  From a management and human resource point of view, we can get much more out of people by treating them with respect and dignity.  Those working in disadvantaged schools in particular must treat the children with equality, respect and dignity and thereby get much more out of those children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the debate.  I would like the Minister to take on board some of my suggestions.  I welcome the change the Minister made on the DEIS schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his initiative in announcing that &euro;35 million would be provided to replace substandard prefabs, many of which are in my constituency.  I believe the provisions of the Bill will lead to better practices in schools of education and will lead to better teachers coming out at the far end.  It will also provide that those wanting to go into teaching will be safeguarded when they are in that role.  As I come from an area where DEIS schools are very much in demand, I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath.  My children all went to DEIS schools whose teachers were excellent, not just as teachers but also in how they looked after children with different social needs.  They looked after the wellbeing of children from breakfast in the morning right through to after-school programmes in the evening.  It takes a special person to teach in such a school.  They need to be interested not only in the academic aspect but in the overall well being of children.</P>
      <P>Last week I visited two schools in my area &mdash; School Street and Goldenbridge &mdash; and I am always impressed with the changes there, particularly with the new literacy initiative.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Some of my comments are not on the Bill but I welcome the opportunity to make them nevertheless.  I have lived, worked and gone to school in an area regarded as disadvantaged. <Col N="660" /> At present, there are four primary schools and one secondary school under the DEIS programme in my area in Inchicore.  There are 900 students between these four schools, a remarkably low number.  When my children went to these schools there were between 400 and 600 in each of them.  Now, some have an enrolment as low as 240 pupils.  Why is this happening?  Why do people chose to send their children outside a parish which in the past had considerable school numbers and where the teachers are as qualified today as they used to be?  Why is there such a stigma around sending children to DEIS programme schools?  I do not have the answer but in the area where I live and work, the label of a DEIS programme school is put not only on the school but on the children and the community.  I have real concerns for all of these schools in the area where I live.  It may benefit some schools in the short term to be under the DEIS label because in the past they received extra money and teachers but how does it benefit them in the long run?  Of the five schools I referred to, I foresee at least two of them closing because I simply do not know how they can keep a sufficient number of children on the roll book.</P>

      <P>Has the overall population dropped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It has increased.  There are many new apartments and many new well-educated young people moving in and bringing up their families in the area.  However, they do not necessarily send their children to school in the area.</P>
      <P>I have many concerns including the reduction in the capitation grant.  I understand that we must make choices and I have said as much myself.  One school is between 60 and 70 years old and has rising damp.  All the classrooms were used at one stage but it cannot afford to use all of them now because it does not have the same number of students as before.  The summer grant and minor works grant are gone.  Those involved are left with the dilemma of whether to heat all or half of the school.  How do they cut the heating in the other half when it is all connected to the one routing service?  The small summer grants for these schools have been cut and this puts them in a worse position.  The standards in the buildings should be rising not falling.  It is very difficult to heat many schools in my area now.  In one of the schools which uses prefabs a large building is being built.  However, as the Minister is aware, the project came to a halt because two developers are not on site now.  This is a real issue.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who was born, reared and who went to school there.  We are left with a dilemma in my parish and community and throughout Dublin South-Central because DEIS programme schools are not attracting the numbers they did in the past.  I realise I am digressing from the Bill but I call on the Minister to consider how we can protect these schools and perhaps give them the extras they need rather than label them.  Labelling schools is wrong for young children and it leaves many of them isolated in their communities.  Many families and parents to whom I have spoken believe it is wrong to label schools and our children.  This has been a growing concern of mine for several years.</P>
      <P>All my children went to DEIS programme schools and they all received a wonderful education at them.  I cannot speak highly enough of the teachers.  I have served on two of the boards and the parents&rsquo; committee as well.  Something must happen now to make a difference to these schools.  We cannot expect schools with numbers of 600 or 400 to survive on the amount of money they receive at present.  I offer one example.  Recently, I was at a meeting where I learned that a school in one area earned &euro;172 in a cake sake.  Another school in a more affluent area in my constituency took in &euro;1,300 in a cake sale.  There is something wrong with that imbalance.  I welcome the changes but we should be aware that we are asking those involved to go to schools and deal with children who have difficulties &mdash; not all of them but <Col N="661" />some of them &mdash; and expect the school to stand on its own ground while the building is falling down around them.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to digress but it is important.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, on this issue.  We must reconsider how we identify schools in RAPID programme areas at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I grew up beside one of the poorest areas in Dublin, Keogh Square.  At one stage some 900 people lived there.  People in Keogh Square will emphasise that they were not disadvantaged.  They may have been poor but they had a quality of life, good parenting and parents who worked.  They had bread and butter on the table for their tea, it was not always a sausage and egg supper.  However, they were stand alone people.  The views of the people I listen to resound in my ear all the time: they do not want to be labelled anymore.  This has destroyed communities and made them no-go areas in many ways and we do not want that.  Last week I visited School Street School in the heart of the Liberties.  It is an excellent school.  Children go there from Oliver Bond flats and School Street and around.  They are the best of children, the best of families and there is the best of support from the parents.  However, they are labelled.  I call on the Minister to consider this in some way.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me some extra time.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Byrne in welcoming the announcement of the &euro;35 million to be put in place to replace temporary substandard accommodation or prefabs.  The news story is that teachers, schools and boards of management have been calling for this type of approach for years because it makes sense.  One can spend &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 per year on renting a prefab and one is paying rent to infinity.  Now, the Minister will put this money into bricks and mortar.  This will provide a better facility for schools and money and jobs in the short term in the hard-pressed construction sector.  I understand this will work as a devolved grant.  This should give more choice to get better value for money for boards of management.  This is a creditworthy decision and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is a good point.  Small schools can be rural or urban.  There is something of a divide.  Parents are concerned about changes and the information they are getting.  There are certain interpretations of the fact of an increase in the pupil teacher ratio which are incorrect and advert to a bad scenario of a school closing.  This is not what the Minister proposes.  I wish to speak to the genuine fears people have for their children in primary school and to the future for rural or small schools.  Predominately, small schools are in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I wish to put paid to the myth that there is a great urban rural divide.  I went to a rural school and I live in a town.  If the Minister came to my town he would realise we are only a stone&rsquo;s throw from being rural.  The distinction is false.  The idea that small schools are being picked on and large schools have it easy or that larger schools or urban areas are more favoured is questionable.  The benefit of being in this position is that I can hear all sides of the story and get information from the Department.</P>
      <P>All schools have one thing in common: they face the same challenges.  Let us consider the larger schools with more than four teachers.  Such schools may have 30 students in a class.  The teachers involved will explain that some of their students are unable to speak English. <Col N="662" /> Nevertheless, they must try to control 30 students or more.  There are more social problems in urban areas and larger schools.</P>
      <P>I am not necessarily talking about disadvantage, but we have more social problems because we have become more sophisticated and urbanised.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are the smaller schools, which must always battle on economies of scale, where a teacher might have several classes in one classroom.  I am a product of that environment and have that experience.  Whichever sort of school parents send their children to, they all say we have an excellent education system. We have and we must begin with that.  In that context, we must make a proportionate response to the fact that the pupil teacher ratio is increasing for small schools.  This is not the end of the world for them.  That is only the interpretation of some people who try to make out that rural Ireland is being picked on.  If that was the case, I would not stand for it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We must look at this in the context that the Minister must make cuts.  We are in a situation where the IMF is involved and because of that, our hands are financially tied and we are constrained.  The Minister&rsquo;s recent decision that 235 DEIS teaching posts, which were to be axed, will be retained has been welcomed generally.  However, when we examine that decision to discover from where the Minister is getting the money, we see he has to cut the capitation grant.  Therefore, the capitation grant is being cut by 3.5% rather than 2%.  Now, some parents from larger schools have e-mailed me to say that now the decision has been made to retain the DEIS teachers, the capitation grant for their children in larger schools has reduced and they are not happy about it.</P>
      <P>We see it all, hear it all and try to make fair decisions.  We should also look at this in another context.  A few years ago, the pupil-teacher ratio in larger schools increased.  Therefore, these schools have seen a tranche of cutbacks.  In the next six years we expect to have approximately 70,000 new students in our primary and  secondary schools.  We must cater for these students, but we have to do that on less money.  Some 92% of the budget for primary schools goes on teachers&rsquo; salaries, increments and pensions.  This leaves little room to manoeuvre with the budget to cover the running costs of schools.  This is down to binding commitments and the Croke Park agreement.</P>
      <P>This is the background to increasing the pupil-teacher ratio.  Currently, in primary schools we have from a ratio of 6:1 in some schools to 30:1 in larger schools.  Over ten years ago, a small school had to have 28 pupils before it got a second teacher.  That did not result in the wholesale closure of smaller schools.  However, if I look around my area, which is a rural area, I see evidence of small schools that have closed down over the past century.  These monuments of old schools exist because the populations are not there to sustain them.  This is the reality of rural Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1965 to 1970-odd, we closed 2,000 one-teacher and two-teacher schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I welcome the appeal mechanism, but not everybody knows about this.  The Minister has picked last September as the date on which the pupil-teacher ratio must be examined and is implementing the cut in numbers of teachers on that basis.  However, people can appeal if they believe the numbers were abnormally low on the specified date.  I welcome that appeal process.</P>
      <P>This issue illustrates the need for a broader debate throughout parishes and communities on the future educational needs of our children and how we can plan for these to be met.  This concerns the organisation of schools for the most part.  Schools have patrons and in areas that <Col N="663" />are predominantly Catholic, the patron is probably the bishop.  We need a forum for discussion on this.  It is not because the Minister has increased the pupil-teacher ratio that suddenly chaos prevails.  There are already underlying problems for small schools.  Aside from the concerns parents express to me, they acknowledge that in some rural areas with small schools within a few miles of each other, these schools are vigorously competing with each other for pupils.  This has caused people to fall out with each other.  The situation is almost like that prevailing in football clubs where people ask what club others support.  That is not the way education should be.  There are many issues surrounding this.  I know of parents who are bypassing the school beside them and taking their children to another school because they have that choice.</P>
      <P>Part of the dialogue on this must involve schools that may not be able to plan their future, whether that should be amalgamation or something else, because of their unique circumstances, such as a non-Catholic school, a non-denominational school or, as in the case of a school about which I wrote to the Minister, a school in a Gaeltacht area which chooses to teach its children through English while all the schools around it teach through Irish.  What are the prospects for such schools?  Every area has unique circumstances.  We know, for example, of schools that are so far from any other schools that pupils could have a 40 km return journey to and from school each day.  We would not wish for pupils to have to undertake that sort of journey.</P>
      <P>People must be empowered and their fears addressed.  I challenge patrons and boards of management to encourage parishes and communities to come together for dialogue on this so that parents do not feel sidestepped or feel that nobody cares about their children.  We do care, but the issues must be discussed in a constructive fashion.  Emotions must be parked.  We all have feelings about things.  However these feelings should not focus on a building or school, but on the best outcome for children in rural areas or areas served by small schools.  This consultation and dialogue must take place, but because every area is unique, each area may come up with an individual plan.  Then, it is up to us and the Minister to respond to these plans.  In that way we can begin the dialogue to make proper provision for the future so that this does not become, in this instance anyway, a rural-urban divide in which spurious arguments are made about some sort of plan or mission to get rid of small schools.  This is clearly not the case.  Parents are concerned and these concerns and fears must be allayed.  The constructive way to do this is for people to get together in dialogue.   That is my challenge to patrons and boards of management.  It is not out of their hands and they are not powerless.  None of us is powerless.  It is the law or the constitutional right of parents to decide on the education of their children.</P>
      <P>However, we are constrained.  The impression given to people by the previous Government over the past number of years that people can have whatever they want is not the case.  That is not the reality of living and is not the economic reality we face now.  However, we do want fairness, equity and democratic consultation and to open dialogue with people.  This is the way to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like others, I acknowledge the announcement on the long-sought abolition of prefabricated classrooms.  There has been significant discussion on this in the House &mdash; long before I was here &mdash; and promises upon promises were made, but it took this Government and Minister to deliver.  They said less than a year ago that there would be a move on this and I commend the Minister on the level of the allocation to replace prefabs with proper accommodation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to declare my support for the amendment to the Bill.  I intend to focus on section 7, but before doing that wish to refer to the mention by previous contributors of the abolition of the Educational Disadvantage Committee.  In principle, I have no great difficulty in agreeing to that.  I want to acknowledge the work the committee did in the past, particularly at the beginning of the process of bringing about the DEIS system.</P>
      <Col N="664" />
      <P>In his speech last night, the Minister referred to a fine report, Moving Beyond Educational Disadvantage, which was published by the committee in 2005.  Essentially, it put up the pillars that were used to develop the DEIS scheme.  It would not have happened as it did if that report had not been published.  The people who worked on the committee should be acknowledged.  I know that, in the past, the Minister has complimented the work of the committee in targeting educational disadvantage in working class areas.  I note his commitment to refer to the report in the future.</P>
      <P>Many of us have large numbers of DEIS schools in our constituencies.  My constituency has 19 such schools, which is the second or third highest number of any constituency.  They are very fine schools.  The Minister and the Government said they would protect DEIS schools.  I have not had an opportunity to acknowledge before now that such schools have been protected.  Like others, I recognise that remarkable progress that has been made in DEIS schools.  It is slow but it is very definite.  Most of us are familiar with the report that came out last January.  It praised the work that is taking place in DEIS schools.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to ruffle the feathers of schoolteachers.  I am sure they constitute a fine body of people.  I always think they are like politicians, plumbers or any other group in the sense that some of them are very good and others are not so good.  I would like to say, without being biased, that some of the principals and teachers in DEIS schools are the finest people in the education sector.  They are working against the tide.  It is the most difficult environment to be teaching in.  They deserve great praise.</P>
      <P>This morning, I attended the opening of a library at Holy Rosary Primary School, which is in my constituency.  The library was opened by the President, Michael D. Higgins.  It is interesting that it was opened today.  Reference has been made to DEIS schools.  The library in question, which is a fine one, is in a large converted prefab.  It did not cost us anything as taxpayers because the parents in the area of this DEIS school organised the building, painting and stocking of the library.  That was done in conjunction with South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s county library, which is the finest library in the country.  It is remarkable.</P>
      <P>It is worth mentioning in that context that we are having this debate on World Book Day.  That was not lost on the President, who tried to persuade the children of the value and importance of reading, particularly at an early age.  Unfortunately, most working class children are reluctant to accept such encouragement.  I was guilty of that in the past.  It is great that we are concluding our Second Stage discussion on this legislation on World Book Day.  I will conclude by restating my support for the amendments that are being made in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterMathews">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to contribute to this debate, as I was not on the list of speakers.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to give every encouragement to the Minister.  I thank him for responding to the need to reorganise the education system.  He appreciates that he can understand what is happening on the ground by visiting small and large schools throughout the country.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on her tremendous insight into particular aspects of DEIS schools in the areas she represents.</P>
      <P>I attended the opening of an extension to St. Mary&rsquo;s national school in Stepaside the other day.  Approximately 300 pupils from 30 different nationality backgrounds attend the school.  It was a joyous experience to see the colourful artwork and craftwork on the walls of the school.  I was uplifted by the vibe of the school, which comprises a cut stone building that is over 100 years old and a new building that adjoins it sympathetically and seamlessly, with wonderful light and space.  When the children were singing songs and playing tunes on the recorder, they <Col N="665" />covered the old traditions of Ireland and the new traditions of the pop culture that travels across borders.</P>
      <P>I would like to pick up on an aspect of what Deputy Catherine Byrne said.  There are some DEIS schools in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  When I spoke to the principal of one of these schools for more than an hour recently, I was saddened to hear of her distress about the falling numbers at her school.  It was quite similar to what Deputy Byrne described.  It seems that certain primary schools, which are not perceived to be DEIS schools, have a magnetic draw.  There is a suggestion that attending those schools is of assistance when it comes to getting places in certain secondary schools.  That compounds the problem described by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is sad that a principal and her team &mdash; I would describe them as human gold &mdash; are being demoralised by the depletion of pupil numbers at their school, which is being undermined by other schools that are nearer to a certain secondary school and perceived to be feeder schools for that school.  I remind the Minister that we have an opportunity to stop this phenomenon.  It should be stopped, if it can be.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne said, perhaps we should stop using labels.  We can give support to DEIS schools without using the word &ldquo;DEIS&rdquo;.  We should merely say a school needs further investment in teachers and facilities.  We should say we are doing something for a school because the need for it is apparent without giving a label to the school.  Labels can be dangerous.  They can become compounding.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well as he continues to work in support of the education system.  I remind him that when great people reflect on their lifetime&rsquo;s work, regardless of the field of endeavour from which they come, they usually say they had wonderful teachers.</P>

      <TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the 29 Deputies, including myself, who have contributed to this Second Stage debate.  If these closing remarks are taken into account, 30 speeches will have been made by the time this debate concludes.  That is evidence of the genuine interest in education of a wide range of Deputies across all sections of this House.  I cannot recall a previous occasion when a Second Stage debate involved so many speakers.  We could probably have had more.  A number of issues were raised during the debate.  As they were raised in different ways, I will take them by theme, rather than citing the Deputies who raised them.</P>
      <P>This Bill is different from the previous Bill of the same name.  It does not refer to the community national schools that will come under the supervision of the VECs, which will soon be known as local education and training boards.  As Members will be aware, we will introduce a comprehensive Bill to consolidate the nine existing Acts that relate to the VECs.  This legislation will also consolidate more than 600 statutory instruments in order to provide for the new 16 local education and training boards which will be the successors to the VECs.  It was deemed appropriate that the provision for the community national schools should be rooted in that legislation, along with all the other activities to be undertaken by the new education and training boards, rather than be established in a separate piece of legislation.  There were good reasons that my predecessor wanted to afford it a statutory basis, although it has not been rolled out properly as yet.  Currently, there are five and a further number will be announced soon, along with the structures for their boards of management and so on.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions and their support for the measure.</P>
      <Col N="666" />
      <P>Much concern was expressed by Members who were teachers in a previous life, so to speak, about the role of the Teaching Council.  They were concerned that it has been established for quite some time; that it was given &euro;5 million in start-up funding; and that it simply collects &euro;90 from the 73,000 registered teachers and there is a question as to what is given to teachers in return.  For the information of those Members who are teachers, for the information of the House and for the record, the Teaching Council will now become a proper self-regulating, professional organisation like the Medical Council or the Law Society or the architects&rsquo; professional body.  The Teaching Council will police and maintain the standards of its own professional members.</P>
      <P>Much lax and loose comment has been made about lazy and indifferent teachers, teachers who cannot be sacked and poor teaching performance.  There have been complaints that teachers are a law unto themselves.  This is a kind of easy soft talk which we have all heard.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act will be activated by this Bill, albeit with a qualification and I will deal with the necessity for that qualification.  The Teaching Council will have the power to ensure that not only are teachers registered, but they pay a variable fee as in the case of retired teachers who wish to remain registered or apprentice teachers who are not yet employed full-time.  Most professions provide a differential fee cost depending on employment status.  This is now a matter to be decided by the Teaching Council and the new council will come into existence later this month.  I urge it to use its powers to address the criticisms.  I will bring to the attention of the Teaching Council the very strident criticisms made by a number of teachers.  Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony from Fine Gael and Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan from the Technical Group are both former teachers and their criticisms were quite scathing of the role and relevance of the council.  This is a task for the Teaching Council.  Deputy Dowds noted that once one is probated, one is a qualified teacher.  In my view, nobody is a permanently qualified anything because it is a continuous learning exercise and there has to be continual professional development in a rapidly changing world.  It is right and proper that evidence of having participated in continuing professional development will be a requirement for continued registration with the Teaching Council, as I understand it.  However, as I think I am obliged to do, I will be bringing to the attention of the new incoming board of the Teaching Council the criticisms and comments made by people who know what they are talking about because they are former teachers.</P>
      <P>The question was raised as to why we have retreated from the absolutist position of only permitting a registered teacher to be paid with moneys from the State and therefore an unqualified teacher cannot be used.  The answer is because, in some very extreme circumstances, the principal of a school will have the choice between sending those pupils home or closing the school.  I issued a circular following the annual conferences of the teaching unions last Easter in which the regulations, guidelines and rules governing the facility and the possibility of such an occurrence were tightened.  This will now have the force of law.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether retired teachers should be re-employed in schools, in my view, they should not.  There is now a differential rate of pay to discourage this practice and retired teachers who return will be paid at the basic rate of pay.  Formerly, they were re-employed at the rate at which they had retired, the top rate.  This practice has now been changed.  On the question of whether a cosy relationship may exist between a new principal and a former principal, one can perhaps suspect this is so and it may be a case of the devil one knows.  All these situations prevailed.  It is the principal of a school and, by extension, the board of management who decides on who will be hired.  We will be addressing this situation by empowering parents and asking schools to indicate the composition of their panels of reserve teachers.  It is normal and reasonable in this day and age to encourage young teachers to be hired in those circumstances and for young teachers who have not been fully probated to be given the opportunity <Col N="667" />to overcome the catch-22 situation to which Deputy Dowds referred, that experience is needed to get a job.</P>
      <P>We have not acceded to the request recently communicated to me to make amendments that would insist on the absolute necessity to employ only qualified teachers even on an emergency basis.  I do not regard this as a practical measure.  It was a bad piece of legislation when it was first enacted and I am making the necessary change now.  As a result, we can now activate section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, which means the council can make it mandatory and can perform the role of a professional body for a profession such as teaching needs.  If some teachers are not performing to a high standard, a complaint can be made to the Teaching Council and the council of peers will decide whether the complaint should be upheld or if the person can continue to be registered as a teacher.  The issue of the disciplining and policing of the profession of teaching is now totally in the hands of the profession itself, which is where it should reside in my view.  If a parent, school or citizen has a grouse about a particular teacher, they can now register that complaint and let the council proceed in the required manner.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill changes the use of the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; to use of the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  The employment control framework fixed in absolute terms the number of people in employment in the public sector, including teachers.  If a teacher is redeployed as a result of being supernumerary in a school, in the past such individuals had a veto on where they would go because their agreement was essential.  It was frequently the case that there would have been agreement between trade union and management sides but the individual concerned would refuse to be redeployed.  I will deal with this matter in some detail in an amendment on Committee Stage and I have dealt with it in the other House.  I am quite prepared to have a formal consultation with the social partners in the education space to achieve a clear idea of the exact meaning of consultation in this instance so that there is broad consensus.  The absolutist position of former times will not apply, where an individual, <i>de facto</i>, had a veto on redeployment if he or she refused to agree.  The real meat in the sandwich, so to speak, is that until such time as we have redeployed existing teachers from the panel to new locations and opportunities, we cannot hire new teachers.  It is not as if we are free agents; in order to acquire new teachers into the system, all surplus teachers on redeployment panels must first be relocated.  This is the nub of the question about agreement and consultation.  I am quite happy to discuss this matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Many other issues have been raised in this debate which are not, as such, germane to this legislation but I will refer to them.  Deputy Catherine Byrne made a very incisive contribution which is rooted in her own experience.  We share adjoining constituencies and some of the area to which she referred used to be in the Dublin South-East constituency.  The issue of stigmatisation has travelled with the DEIS label.  The label of being from a disadvantaged area is chosen from a set of socio-economic criteria.  One can be highly disadvantaged from a very wealthy family if one is not loved, cherished and minded.  I got my knuckles rapped for saying that a child who goes to bed at night without having a story read to him or her is an abused child.  I accept fully it is not the right use of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, because of other connotations, but it is certainly a deprived child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>An ignored child.  That runs across the social spectrum.  Perhaps the motivations in regard to delivering education equality in schools was properly constructed but perhaps we must look at the connotation and stigmatisation because there are unintended consequences, to which Deputy Mathews referred, where school X is not seen as a good feeder school for second level and so on.  Those contributions are valuable and we will have an opportunity to talk about them as we go forward.</P>
      <Col N="668" />
      <P>I refer to the issue of small schools.  Deputy Mulherin said most small schools are in rural Ireland, although not all.  She would be surprised to know there is a two-teacher school in Bluebell hiding behind an enormous church where at one by-election there were more canvassers outside the church than there were congregants inside it.  One could put a Boeing 747 into the church.  It was the first and only time I was ever outside it.</P>
      <P>The value for money report, commissioned by my predecessor, Mary Coughlan, will be published in approximately the next three to four weeks.  There is no fixed date yet.  That is the time when there will be a debate around the issue of small schools, the cost of them, the relative merits and demerits of them, what we do about them and how we deal with the reality that citizens of the Republic living in isolated areas are entitled to access to primary education and whether they are in the same category as half a dozen schools less than 5 km from a provincial town.</P>
      <P>I was in Drumshanbo last Friday on a constituency visit to Sligo and Leitrim.  In 1975, five small rural schools in the vicinity of Drumshanbo voluntarily decided voluntarily to come together.  I addressed a school of 230 pupils and 11 teachers with a whole array of support services, including an autism unit.  It provided a mix and a range.</P>
      <P>In a two-teacher or three-teacher school where the teacher is teaching two or three different classes, it can be a lottery.  I believe it was Deputy Mathews who said we all know what school we went to but we will always remember the great teachers.  In the nature of things, they are not all that great, although there are some that impress.</P>
      <P Just="Left">For example, a definition of a small school in New Zealand, which has a population base similar to ours, is 200 pupils.  I am not going there but we need to look at countries such as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have similar cultures, backgrounds and traditions to ours to see how they deal with this issue.  We will return to it after the value for money report has been debated.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed about some provisions of the Bill which recognise in law the fact on the ground and that speech and language therapy are services delivered by the HSE and not by the Department of Education and Skills.  This is simply recognising the reality on the ground.  I do not have the power to direct the HSE and there is a variation in the delivery of the same service in different parts of the country.  If people have that experience I suggest they raise it with the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>That covers most of the issues we debated.  We talked about giving preference to trained teachers, as distinct from retired teachers in temporary posts, and ensuring they are probated as much as possible.  We talked about amending section 30 of the Teaching Council Act so that it can be activated and made real.  In terms of industrial relations, we talked about the necessity to move from agreement to consultation in order to facilitate deployment.</P>
      <P>It is a short Bill but it covers a wide spectrum of educational issues and that is one of the reasons we have had just 30 contributions to this debate.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for attending the Chamber.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the newsletter of the company involved in the modern languages in primary schools initiative.  The most recent edition refers to the ending of the modern languages in primary schools initiative <Col N="670" />as a devastating blow for all of those involved in language education in primary, secondary and third level education.  It was completely unexpected.  Language learning has never been so much to the forefront of national politics, which is a good thing.  This group of people tried to get host teacher training positions for partner colleges in France, Germany and Spain and demand always exceeds supply.  The trainees in schools always benefit from the experience.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the small amount of money saved by this measure.  The initiative was exceptional value for money, with a small budget allowing 27,000 fifth class and sixth class pupils to benefit.  The programme costs very little and the programme develops the child&rsquo;s language and literacy skills.  The Minister is focused on literacy and numeracy and I hope he will see the link between this initiative and literacy and numeracy.  The 2008 report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is being quoted as the reason for stopping this initiative but it is also fair to point out that the NCCA is currently revising the language curriculum for primary schools.  I hope it will re-examine this matter and recommend the programme&rsquo;s retention.  Some people tell me it will cost more to wind down the scheme than to continue it.</P>
        <P>The Minister cannot say this is a pilot project because the cap was lifted in 2007.  Since then, 200 more schools have joined the scheme.  Ireland is the only country in Europe, apart from Scotland, where foreign languages are not a mandatory part of the curriculum.  We need this initiative more than ever.  Students leaving our education system need strong literacy, numeracy, language and ICT skills.  An article by Colm O&rsquo;Rourke, the well-known teacher and Gaelic football commentator, refers to the PayPal announcement and other high-tech jobs.  Many people talk about the need for language skills at primary level also and I hope the Minister will re-examine this.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position of the decision taken in budget 2012.  As part of the budget 2012 decisions, the modern languages in primary schools initiative will cease at the end of the 2011-12 school year.  The savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have spoken repeatedly about the need to raise educational standards.  In terms of curriculum reform, the priorities in the period ahead are to strengthen achievement in literacy and numeracy, to implement reforms in maths, Irish and science and to progress junior cycle reforms at second level.</P>
        <P>The modern languages in primary schools initiative was a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools and has been operating since 1998.  It has not been possible for other schools to join the pilot project for a number of years and the way in which it operated was not capable of being rolled out to all 3,200 primary schools.  The decision to end the scheme was based in part on policy advice from a 2008 report by the NCCA, which identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.  The advice of the NCCA was that modern languages should not be part of the primary school curriculum as an additional and separate subject.  The advice on curriculum overload predated the wake-up call on literacy and numeracy from the PISA results.  I am taking on board that advice and I am happy that we need to focus on literacy and numeracy.  The entire primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  The &euro;2.5 million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new national strategy, the total cost of which is approximately &euro;19 million.  The 17% of schools currently in the initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.</P>
        <Col N="671" />
        <P>The focus of the review will be on how best to enhance children&rsquo;s learning in these areas, provide a clear delineation of the learning outcomes required and integrate into the infant cycle the learning experiences from Aistear, the curriculum framework for early childhood education.  At post primary level, targeted support is provided to schools to enable them to diversify language provision with a particular focus on Spanish, Japanese, Russian and Italian.  Other languages taught at second level include French, German and Arabic.  Participation in foreign languages, relative to other subjects, remains high.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of students are studying two languages and are therefore developing core skills which will serve them well in future language learning over their lifespan, and there are many opportunities outside the second level system for people to resume language learning.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I referred to PayPal.  Its vice president said when the jobs announcement was made that, &ldquo;In the last two weeks and months I have been looking for a number of potential locations in Europe and Ireland.  However, due to the rich talent and language skills of the workforce in Ireland we decided it was the best place where we wanted to do business&rdquo;.  PayPal also encouraged those without languages and the unemployed to apply for jobs.  It said it was very confident that people who had language skills would be those they would want to employ.  I understand more projects are coming down the road.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the literacy and numeracy initiative.  There was a school library grant which, I am sorry to say, the last Government did away with.  I understand &euro;2 million was involved.  I would like to see the Minister reconsider the initiative.  An allocation of even &euro;1 million would provide &euro;40,000 to every county.  The great library service we have allows 15 of the same book to be lent to schools, which enables them to do projects.  I criticised the former Minister for the decision.  The school library service will come to a halt because books will not be replaced and more fund-raising will be required.</P>
        <P>The expert group that reported last Tuesday on jobs, markets and opportunities stated most advertised positions were in sales and ICT and third level qualifications are required.  Foreign languages, particularly German and Nordic languages, continue to be in demand.  That is the most recent report I have seen.  The Minister should take what it said about foreign languages on board.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I understand the concern that has been expressed by many well-intentioned people about this.  We have been codding ourselves in this country for some time about the extraordinary quality of our education system.  Other countries have been devoting a lot of time to reform and improving their systems.  As a consequence, we have dropped much further than most people realise from a literacy ranking of fifth in the world league to seventeenth. </P>
        <P>All of the education advice I have received over the past year and before I became Minister was that competency in literacy and numeracy are key predictors for educational outcomes as people move through formal education and into the adult career of their choice.  We have to get those basic components right.  The focus of attention is on that area.  At a time when this country has lost its economic sovereignty and we have to reduce overall expenditure we have to make priority choices.  I did not make this choice lightly and knew it would disrupt and disappointed some people, but in a world where choices have to be made I made the right choice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic and the Minister for being here to listen and respond.  The State should not pay more than market rents and rents should not be kept artificially high.  I agree that affects all renters, including those not in receipt of rent assistance.  We are on the same page on that. </P>
        <P>Renting private property is not a long-term solution.  There was a major missed opportunity over the past 15 years to deal with the supply side. I  accept we are in a country which does not have the money to put ideal solutions in place.  The situation must be managed.  I know there will be a one-stop shop which should help matters.  I see people in difficulty every single week.  I have a couple of boxes of tissues on the counter of my office because people come to see me in a terribly distressed state over what has happened.  There is no nuanced approach to some parts of the country in regard to the limits on rent assistance.</P>
        <P>For two adults and two children living in Lucan or south Dublin the allowance is &euro;925 a month.  In Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth, an area which has a population equivalent to that of Waterford City and which is very much a suburb of Dublin, the allowance is &euro;725 a month.  No properties are available for that kind of money.  I looked at <i>www.daft.ie</i> earlier and noted there were 62  three-bedroom properties available in Kildare, but not one in the three towns to which I referred.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of landlords not accepting rent assistance.  There is no overhang of properties in those towns because most were sold off the plans.  No NAMA-based solutions are in the offing.  People have to look much further afield which means they may have to move their children to other towns.  This creates a series of problems.  Many schools are oversubscribed and it is very difficult to set up a child with special needs with additional resources in a new place.  They are also being taken away from their friends.</P>
        <P>There are quite a lot of properties advertised on <i>www.daft.ie</i> in south Kildare which one could rent for &euro;725 a month but one cannot get them in north Kildare.  The changes will be counter-productive in terms of the savings to the State if children require supports to be moved from schools.  I understand the Department made a decision on a county by county basis but there can be variations within counties.</P>
        <P>Some 43% of the housing waiting list is concentrated in six regions, Dublin City, south Dublin, Cork City, Cork county, Kildare and Fingal.  The bottom 3% accounts for only 3% of the list.  Some counties are affected more than others.  There must be a more nuanced approach.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue seriously.  The whole country will not need to be reviewed, but the Department can be made aware of people who have been told to vacate properties within eight weeks.  In many cases there is nowhere for them to vacate to.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  The new maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved while at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement were not priced out of the market for good quality private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector &mdash; about 95,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement and we will spend over &euro;0.5 billion on it this year &mdash; it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in way that could increase rent prices for others such as low paid workers and students.</P>
        <P>Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit, the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree <Col N="673" />to reduce the rent to the new rates, I have specifically asked that departmental officials discuss the options open to the tenant, up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.</P>
        <P>The Department is monitoring the impact of the implementation of the new limits.  If Deputy Murphy has examples of children having to change school as a result of the change to the limits, she should pass the information on to the Department as soon as possible.  I recognise what she is saying about differences from area to area.  This was built into the study and we will take this into account.</P>
        <P>Although the new limits have only been in place for two months, the current trends would suggest that the market is adjusting and the level of availability at the new limits is increasing.</P>
        <P>The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from &euro;369 million to a provisional outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011.  The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from 60,200 in 2005 to over 96,800 at the end of 2011, representing a 61% increase.  The Deputy has acknowledged how difficult the economic circumstances are.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On the question of the clustering of rented properties, I am sure the Deputy will agree that rent supplement is not a long-term solution for those with a housing need.  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long-term reliance on rent supplement: the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which has been in operation since 2004; and the new housing policy initiative, as announced by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State responsible for housing and planning, on 16 June 2011.  The full implementation of these initiatives will address concerns about social mix and the clustering of social accommodation, allowing rent supplement to return to being a short-term income support payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>Websites such as <i>www.daft.ie</i> show that people are being priced out of the market.  There are no alternatives.  I will certainly send the Minister a note on some of the cases related to children.  From my experience, the tenant must always relocate; there has been no realistic alternative to date, although I accept we are in the early days.</P>
        <P>I have carried out an analysis of the RAS properties.  Kildare County Council was struggling to obtain RAS houses in the part of County Kildare to which I refer.  There were other parts in which it was able to get them.  There are only 1,100 RAS houses but there is a housing waiting list of 6,047.  Circumstances are worse than those in Fingal.</P>
        <P>The problem is that there is no RAS option in the part of the county in question because the turnover of houses is minuscule.  Where there is a turnover of RAS houses, because people get a job or decide to rent privately, there is some freedom.  I ask the Minister to examine the problem in the part of the county to which I refer.  If the Department considers the market information that is available to me, I am 100% certain it will find the information I find.  I check it regularly.  The problem must be managed while we are in a position in which there is no better option.  There is a problem; it is not a national problem but there are problems in small parts of the country.  The area to which I refer has a serious one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I would be very grateful if the Deputy forwarded me details of the cases about which she is most concerned.  The study carried out by the Department was carried out very much in conjunction with community welfare officers, who are now officers of the Department of Social Protection.  The information used was check-marked against all the county information available on rates of rent and appropriate rates.</P>
        <Col N="674" />
        <P>Our housing comprises 40% of that in the housing market.  There has been an extraordinary collapse in house values.  Evidence from the private market shows that good tenants get reductions in rent.  I appreciate it is difficult for somebody on rent supplement to face negotiating a deal with his landlord.  Ultimately, however, if we overpay, we drive up rents for individuals such as workers and students, who are paying rent from their wages or parents&rsquo; incomes.  If the Deputy supplies me with the relevant information, my Department will certainly monitor the problem.  I am determined to obtain more value for taxpayers&rsquo; money with regard to rents.  Given the extraordinary fall in house values, it would be quite extraordinary not to have better value available and affordability in respect of rent supplement.  The evidence is that landlords are responding by giving better rental value to taxpayers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
        <P>In case we are at odds, the Minister should note that the focus of the media and public at present is very much on the retirement of public service personnel.  This is a separate issue from the one on which I want to focus, namely, bad expenditure practices in the public service that affect the taxpayer.  Most members of the public refer to abuses of taxpayers&rsquo; money in Departments, local authorities, etc.  People believe these abuses are &ldquo;part of the culture&rdquo;, a uniquely Irish phrase.  The practices have nothing to do with culture; they involve the abuse of our taxes by a small number of people who are devoid of civic responsibility.</P>
        <P>On mainland Europe, one admires the ways in which governments and public services can cut costs and protect the taxpayer from abuses or bad practices.  When the Minister, Deputy Howlin, first took over his Department, I focused on certain sentences he used.  Consequently, I believe he understands where I am coming from.  In a very bad and deep recession, a different approach is required because there is not enough money.  Whatever money is available is provided at the behest of our generous neighbours, who, of course, want it to be repaid.  After 90 years of independence, we have an opportunity to change our habits.  This must be taken as savings are required.  The Department has engaged in change but the public should know about it.  That is the purpose of my raising this matter.</P>
        <P>It was public servants who brought this matter to my attention, but not only when I was canvassing 12 months ago.  They highlighted bad practices in Departments and local authorities.  Fair play to them because, by and large, most public and civil servants are quite decent, honest people.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Maloney for raising this issue, although the impact of departmental savings is a fairly broad topic.  Having listened to him, however, I now understand the focus of his commentary, which certainly merits some discussion.  On taking office, one of the things I did was to have a cross-departmental review, which culminated in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-14 published on 5 December 2011.  I also published the capital infrastructure plan on 10 November 2011.  Meanwhile, the implementation body&rsquo;s publication of the public service agreement &mdash; the so-called Croke Park agreement &mdash; progress report was published on 17 November 2011.  The public service reform plan, which examined all the public service reforms we wanted to make, was also published on 17 November 2011.</P>
        <P>That is the way we will look at bringing about real reforms on the issues referred to by the Deputy.  The general public and public servants have been talking about tackling issues like abuse, waste and bad practices.  As the Deputy knows, I have set up a website to which people &mdash; particularly those on the front line who understand what is going on in the public service <Col N="675" />&mdash; have been invited to make submissions.  We got an extraordinary variety of good submissions which have been incorporated into the comprehensive expenditure review.  All that documentation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The ceilings we have set will ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices will play a full part in contributing to what needs to happen in any event, which is budgetary consolidation.  Deputy Maloney will recall the issue of performance budgeting which we included in the Revised Estimates Volume 2012, published last week.  It was an initiative that now involves almost all Departments.  The annual Estimates of expenditure have been re-cast to ensure full alignment with Departments&rsquo; statements of strategy and to include performance information against each of the high-level objectives set out in the programme.</P>
        <P>The old accounting mechanism of allocating a volume of money to a particular budget line is now accompanied &mdash; people will have read the tome that arrived on their desks last week &mdash; with an actual expected outcome for that money.  I hope Oireachtas committees will be able to follow that to ensure that the money voted will have the specifically expressed outcomes in terms of quantities of individuals to be treated, cases to be processed, or specific outcomes to be expected.</P>
        <P>The new Estimates offer a much more open way of doing business.  The performance budgeting initiative is just one wave of a broad tide of reform which I hope is sweeping over an age-old system for managing public expenditure.  One commentator said this was the first time such fundamental reform had happened since Victorian times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In last December&rsquo;s comprehensive expenditure report, I introduced a new medium-term expenditure framework that sets fixed expenditure ceilings for every Department for 2013 and, on an indicative basis, for 2014.  Last month, I wrote to the chairpersons of all Oireachtas select committees dealing with Estimates, inviting them to begin the process of engagement with Departments on how next year&rsquo;s Estimates should be shaped.  It would also be useful for Oireachtas committees to listen to the front line experience of workers and to put that to Departments in framing next year&rsquo;s Estimates.</P>
        <P>Taking the whole gamut of reforms the Government has laid out, the entire system of public expenditure is undergoing a sea change of which the achievement of expenditure savings is just one element, albeit an important one.  The focus remains on delivering the best possible services, eliminating waste and abuse, and ensuring that we perform at a world-class level.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his comments and congratulate him on his Department&rsquo;s website.  Of the people who brought about five cases to my attention in the past 12 months, four of them have taken up the Minister&rsquo;s offer, which is very good.  For example, a mid-ranking manager in a large Dublin hospital handed me a piece of paper and &mdash; almost shamefully, as an ordinary conscientious taxpayer &mdash; described what was going on in his workplace, which was a waste of public money.  Virtually all public servants want these sort of abuses to stop.  It operates marginally in other jurisdictions.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the completely different monitoring system in the UK.  His initiative, however, is the first of its kind in the history of the State.  He mentioned a commentator&rsquo;s reference to Victorian times, but I am not a big fan of Queen Victoria so I will not praise her in the House.</P>
        <P>I should have qualified my earlier comments by saying that both the Minister and I are public servants, so we come into that, except that in our case we are temporary or part-time.</P>

        <P>We sometimes forget it, but I meant to say that we should be included in this subject matter.  By the way, I drafted this Topical Issue before the cartridge-gate saga, although I do not want to go down this road.  Without a doubt, that is a typical example of how the public perceive the Minister, myself and everyone else in this House.  It is up to all of us to bring a halt to all those practices and not just in here, but throughout the public service.  Eventually, we have to reach a stage where people realise that the use of the phrase &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s the State that&rsquo;s paying for it&rdquo;&mdash; the old colonial language that Irish people use &mdash; is not good enough.  Forget the State, it is the ordinary taxpayer who is paying for it, so we have to change that mindset.</P>
        <P>If I understood the Minister correctly, he said that when the programme period is over he will size up the matter himself.

When things are understood to be open and accessible, people will be much more mindful of how they use resources.  There must be a balance, however, because we must be able to justify the use of resources as well.  It is true that Ministers are reluctant to use the Government jet, which always surprises me because we paid for it and it is sitting on a runway.</P>

        <P>We have pilots that are paid for, while Ministers are now saying: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll take commercial flights and leave that there.&rdquo;  We need to have a different approach that is efficient, mindful of scarce resources and not wasteful.  I fully agree with the Deputy in that regard.</P>
        <P>My final point concerns the management of it, and Deputy Maloney touched on cartridge-gate.  It is important to give authority to managers, whether in the Oireachtas or elsewhere, simply to alert people to say &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;.  If this is the accepted norm, they will not only have the authority but the responsibility to manage resources properly and well.  That should happen across the public service.  It is part of the process that is happening right now in the reforms agenda.  We have a long way to go because, to abuse the word the Deputy used himself, there is a culture change.  The vast majority of those in the public service understand that, as taxpayers, they want good value and want to eliminate waste.  That is the objective of this Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the important issue of the appointment of a director to the National Office for Suicide Prevention following the retirement in October of Mr. Geoff Day, who was appointed to the post in 2005.  I am concerned that in five months no replacement has been appointed.  I wish to recognise the service of the acting director, Catherine Brogan, who is also the national planning specialist for mental health.</P>
        <Col N="677" />
        <P>However, a full appointment is urgent, not least because of a 25% increase in suicide levels in the past two years.  The latest statistics for 2012 show 486 people died from suicide with 127 non-determined deaths.  It is internationally recognised that it is more accurate to include non-determined deaths as suicide which, if applied to the 2010 figures, mean more than 600 people died from suicide.  For comparison purposes, 185 people died in road accidents.  The success of the Road Safety Authority should be a template for how to tackle the issue of suicide.</P>
        <P>On numerous occasions over the past 12 months, I called for an increase in the budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I sincerely welcome the 2012 increase from &euro;4.7 million to &euro;7.7 million, the extra &euro;3 million coming from the &euro;35 million allocated to the implementation budget for A Vision for Change.  With such a substantial increase to the office&rsquo;s budget, it is important a director is appointed to apply this investment to ensure there is a planned and detailed programme with clear targets and objectives to reduce suicide and related issues.  The programme for implementation must also have checks and balances to deal with other areas such as parasuicide.  Last year, 9,630 people attended accident and emergency departments due to parasuicide.  Conservative estimates put the figure for attempted suicide or self-harm between 60,000 and 70,000 last year.</P>
        <P>The person appointed to the directorship should have a clear knowledge and understanding of the areas of suicide, international and national research such as that of the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork, the prevention of suicide and bereavement of suicide support.  It is also important the director has a role outside the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Societal factors and others apply to the whole area of suicide prevention.  There must be an understanding on the part of the director about the involvement of organisations and other Departments, apart from the mental health section of the Department of Health, such as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in suicide prevention.  The director must not have an approach that confines the office to the HSE where it is stationed but one that includes broader societal agencies in suicide prevention.  These broader societal factors are mirrored in the office&rsquo;s implementation programme.  It is absolutely urgent a director is appointed to organise, implement and execute that programme.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important issue for which we all share his concerns.  I am taking this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, Minister of State with responsibility for mental health issues, who cannot be present today.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established by the HSE in 2005 to implement Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.  The office is guided by an advisory group comprising individuals with considerable knowledge and expertise around suicide prevention and mental health promotion.  The work of the office is constantly evolving and its programme of activities is focused on evidence-based interventions and also involves the funding of new research and pilot projects.</P>
        <P>My ministerial colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is very much aware the national office plays a key role in developing and supporting initiatives related to suicide prevention.  Since the launch of Reach Out and the establishment of the national office, there has been a significant amount of cross-sectorial working which has resulted in considerable advances in suicide prevention.</P>
        <P>Initiatives include the ASIST and Safetalk training programmes, the tough economic times programme and the mental health awareness campaigns.  Support has also been given to voluntary organisations in their work on suicide prevention.  All-island co-operation in the areas of promoting positive mental health and tackling the issue of suicide has been promoted.  Funding <Col N="678" />has also been provided for several suicide community assessment nurses, SCAN, to work in primary care to provide an effective and co-ordinated response for people who are in distress.  A working group has been established to address the issue of reducing access to the means of suicide and self-harm in a national and co-ordinated way.  In addition, the national office recently established a working group to review again the current activities in this area and to determine the priorities within suicide prevention to ensure we maximise the available resources.</P>
        <P>The former director of the national office, Geoff Day, retired last September.  I thank him for his contribution and commitment over the years in the area of suicide prevention.  Having regard to the importance of the work of the office, the HSE appointed an acting director while expressions of interest were sought for the permanent position.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 3 February and interviews will take place later this month.  It is expected the appointment to the permanent position should take place shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the issue of suicide prevention is one of the most urgent challenges currently facing society.  It is committed to further developing our mental health and suicide prevention services.  This commitment was clearly shown in budget 2012 which provided for a special allocation of &euro;35 million for mental health in line with programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen the community mental health teams in both adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services and to implement prioritised suicide prevention measures.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for her response.  It is important the work of the suicide resource officers who are allocated to the former health board areas should come under the auspices of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  It is vital their work, which also includes suicide bereavement and promoting good mental health, is co-ordinated with the office.  We have the fourth highest suicide rate in Europe after Lithuania, Finland and Estonia.  We have a very serious youth suicide problem.  We require a programme headed by a person at the level of assistant national director.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, promised that a national director of mental health would be appointed to oversee mental health services.  The appointment must be made immediately.  I have expressed my repeated concern on the allocation of the &euro;35 million to ensure the objectives of the Government and those outlined in A Vision for Change are implemented according to the will of the Government and best practice.  The appointment of the director is vital, as is the appointment of the director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall">
        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I acknowledge the expertise and commitment of Deputy Neville in this important area and the tremendous work he has done in that regard.  We accept the point he made.  We are determined to ensure that mental health services are provided locally at community level for both adults and children.  That is why there has been such a clear commitment on the additional funding for this year&rsquo;s budget, notwithstanding the difficult economic situation generally.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is determined to develop the services to meet the considerable demand that exists.  She has been particularly vocal about the need to establish a national director for mental health services.  That will happen in the coming months.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>Pathways to Work is a new approach to the provision of services to unemployed people, the objective of which is to reduce the level of long-term unemployment and, in so doing, to ensure the overall level of unemployment will reduce as the economy returns to growth.</P>
        <P>In developing the policy the Government is acutely aware that the level of long-term unemployment at approximately 40% and unemployment among young people at approximately 30% could, as in previous recessions, become embedded and persist past the economic upturn.  The Government is determined not to let this happen.  There are two major elements to the Government&rsquo;s response &mdash; the action plan for jobs and pathways to work.  The goal of the action plan for jobs is to create new jobs and the goal of Pathways to Work is to help ensure that as many as possible of those jobs, and other job vacancies, get filled by people from the live register.</P>
        <P>Pathways to Work has five major strands.  They include, more regular and ongoing engagement with people who are unemployed; greater targeting of activation places and opportunities; incentivising the take-up of opportunities; incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed; and reforming institutions to deliver better services to people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>The project plan for the National Employment and Entitlements Service, NEES, was approved by Government last June.  Since then considerable progress has been made and the transfer of the community welfare service, CWS, and the F&Aacute;S employment service were completed on schedule in October 2011 and January 2012, respectively.  The Department is now developing the new integrated service as set out in Pathways to Work.  The new integrated service will be piloted from four office locations in May of this year and extended to a further ten offices by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>As the question suggested, the roll-out of the new service will be very challenging for my Department and will require the allocation of additional internal staff and external resources to employment services and activation work.  The transfer of approximately 1,700 staff from the CWS and F&Aacute;S, the majority of whom have significant experience in working with clients in a case management model has enhanced the capabilities of the Department in this regard.  In addition, the Department is also engaged in a programme of systems development and <Col N="680" />process change that should enable staff from within its own resources to be deployed in accordance with the new model.</P>
        <P>The use of external resources, including private sector providers of employment services, will be also considered.  It must be noted however that the use of external resources is nothing new &mdash; the Department, previously F&Aacute;S, engages approximately 23 local employment service, LES, providers to provide employment services including job coaching, mentoring, and job search assistance to the people who are long-term unemployed and funds those activities to the value of &euro;20 million per annum.  Currently, approximately 300 staff are engaged by LES companies in the provision of employment services.  The Department also has similar external contract arrangements in place to cater for the requirements of clients with disabilities who wish to return to the workforce.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>
        </P>
        <P>With regard to the use of private sector providers, the use of such providers is being evaluated by the Department.  As part of this process the Department has reviewed the experience in a number of other countries and has met or had telephone conferences with its counterparts in France, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany and Norway.  The Department has also met with Professor Dan Finn from the centre for social inclusion at the University of Portsmouth.  Professor Finn is an acknowledged expert in the area of contracting public employment services.  It is clear from the work done to date that the use of private sector providers is common throughout OECD countries with different models in place in different states.  No firm proposals have been developed as yet but if, and when, such proposals are developed the issues raised by the experience of other countries will inform the approach taken by the Department and the issues raised by the Deputies will be also considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for her response to the priority question.  She stated that some external contractors will be appointed to engage with the new staff when they have been trained.  It will involve private companies engaging with social welfare claimants.  Often that is a results-based contract where contractors are paid according to their success in getting claimants back to work.  Similar situations arise in other countries such as Australia and the United States where private contractors have exploited the relationship by cherry-picking claimants most likely to return to work and avoiding the most difficult cases.  In this instance, that would defeat the exercise.  Could the Minister clarify the situation?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to 1,600 workers from F&Aacute;S coming to the Department, in addition to community welfare officers and the training that will be involved in augmenting the new programme.  How much funding has been allocated for that purpose?  Is there provision for the spend and has it been included in the allocation for the coming year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Department is currently evaluating the various models operating in other countries.  I expect to be able to develop proposals following the evaluation.  I am extremely conscious of what the Deputy has referenced, which is the negative experiences in some countries, as well as positive experiences.  In this country, using the local employment services model, we have experience of taking in people to provide services who are not civil servants through external agencies and companies.  I hope we will use the best models that are available.</P>
        <P>There is no compelling evidence one way or the other from international experiences about a greater effectiveness from the private sector.  The net issue here is, given that so many people are unemployed and need assistance to get back into training and education, what additional resources do we require and what other models can develop and use, either within the public <Col N="681" />service or with the assistance on a selective basis of the private sector to improve the service to those who are unemployed? That is the net issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I welcomed the idea of the NEES that was outlined in the presentation, in addition to Pathways to Work on previous occasions.  Yesterday, the Minister lost 246 staff from the Department as a result of the early retirement scheme and she is not replacing the majority of them.</P>
        <P>The numbers applying for social welfare payments has been increasing across every scheme since the recession commenced.  The Department&rsquo;s budget has been cut by &euro;811 million.  By 2014, its spending will have been cut by a further &euro;1 billion.  Has the Department the capacity to deliver a deeper and more regular engagement with jobseekers?  There are more job-ready people than there are jobs.  The European Vacancy Monitor, EVM, suggests one vacancy for every 50 jobseekers.  This presents a large challenge.  I am not being negative and I wish the Minister luck.  The least that the unemployed deserve is a meaningful engagement with the Department, by which I mean a pathway to work, as suggested by the title of the initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s concerns are shared by everyone.  This represents a major change for the Department, which took in an extra 1,000 employees from the Community Welfare Service, CWS, an extra 700 employees from the F&Aacute;S employment services and approximately 300 people who work in local employment service companies to provide one-to-one monitoring.  We are also investing heavily in the roll-out of additional computer systems and other developments, for example, the personal services card.</P>
        <P>It is all change in the Department.  Many of the additional CWS and F&Aacute;S personnel have considerable experience of one-to-one interactions with clients and customers, which is precisely the kind of background and experience that is required when providing intensive help to someone who has unfortunately become long-term unemployed.</P>
        <P>As to resourcing the roll-out, staff in the public service are committed under the Croke Park agreement to responding to the requirements for change.  Since I became Minister, intensive work has been under way in this regard.  The Department&rsquo;s senior management is continuously and actively engaged in the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>It all comes back to the fact that there are 50 jobseekers for every vacancy, which is well above the EU average.  The Minister mentioned the large number of staff who have been taken on by her Department, but it has also taken on a large amount of extra work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Absolutely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>The staff require a great deal of training.  When can we expect the full roll-out of profiling, the group management or group hug-type idea and access to jobs and training, which are required if the plan is to work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>My initial question on the private companies to be taken on to initiate part of this process was in a similar vein, given the fact that staff have been lost and others are joining the Minister&rsquo;s Department from other Departments and will need to be trained.  The Pathways to Work initiative is an honest effort to address this issue and we agree with the concept of the one-stop-shop, but the training, placement and correct management of the service will not be ready until later this year, if at all.  For example, SOLAS will not be on stream for another year.  Has the Minister explored the types of contracts and safeguards that will be developed for private companies or is she depending on prior experience with the companies in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="682" />
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The new system of drawing a profile or picture of new applicants has been tested.  In the roll-out and testing to date, approximately 7,000 such profiles have been done.  The model for the prediction of exit was developed in conjunction with the ESRI.</P>
        <P>In May, we will launch four offices that will be models for the new integrated service.  Their locations will be King&rsquo;s Inns Street, Tallaght, Arklow and Sligo.  We will roll the initiative out to a further ten offices later this year.  We have an ambitious roll-out programme.</P>
        <P>The private sector can bring attributes to the table.  We are examining models.  However, reports seem to indicate that some models are not particularly appropriate for Ireland.  For example, the cherry-picking that is payments by results has been criticised.  There has been an active debate on this matter in the UK.  On the other hand, good private sector models can probably bring expertise to the Department.</P>
        <P>We have a large staff.  Through the Croke Park agreement, staff in trade unions have agreed to co-operate with change.  Their response to the roll-out of the new system, which is being led on the ground by senior management, has been positive.  I look forward to positive outcomes but it represents a significant transformational change in the Department.</P>

        <Quest>   whether she has or will consider introducing pension and social welfare entitlement incentives as a means of encouraging persons approaching retirement age to engage in job share arrangements to transition towards retirement and simultaneously provide employment opportunities to facilitate others in remaining in or re-entering the workforce; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[11999/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>In the first instance, responsibility for the terms and conditions of employment for public sector workers, including retirement and pension issues, lies with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government introduced a moratorium preventing the recruitment of staff in the public sector except in limited circumstances.  This decision was made in the context of the agreement with the troika.  Regarding the private sector and occupational pension schemes specifically, the trust deed and-or scheme rules will determine retirement dates.  Any change to these provisions would be a matter for the pension scheme trustees and-or the employers.</P>
        <P>The public sector already has extensive work sharing and family friendly arrangements for employees, as do some private sector employers, particularly the larger ones.  Recent research on intergenerational solidarity by the OECD demonstrates that the rate of employment of younger people has no relationship with the rate of employment of older people.  The OECD states: &ldquo;The idea that public policy can re-shuffle a fixed number of jobs between workers of different ages is simply not true in anything but the very short-term.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Given the agreement with the troika and the current financial environment, it would be difficult to create a new scheme.  If we are to deliver on our social contract to those in retirement, we need people to remain in work for as long as possible so that we can deliver the supports necessary on retirement.  The challenges facing the pension system are significant.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>
        </P>
        <P>The population share of those aged 65 years and over is expected to more than double by 2050.  People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 88 years for women and 83.9 years for men.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.  Currently, <Col N="683" />there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than 2:1 by mid-century.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population.  In view of this the introduction of a scheme that encouraged reduced participation in the labour market for older workers would be inconsistent with the interaction of current working age and pensions policy.</P>
        <P>In terms of assisting those on the live register to secure employment, my Department operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  These measures are consistent with efforts being made to encourage and facilitate people to continue to work up to and beyond pension age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>I originally put this proposal to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation several months ago but it was rejected.  Approximately 450,000 people are out of work and many of them are highly qualified.  The emigration rates are abnormal and many of our people will leave the country after passing through the education system.</P>
        <P>This scheme would operate on a completely voluntary basis in the public and private sectors and it should not affect the Croke Park agreement or the embargo.  It merely facilitates those who wish to share work.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider the scheme given that it could take thousands of people off the live register and give them the opportunity to get on the career ladder and develop their skills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Fleming is proposing a form of sharing work, particularly among those who might wish to slow down as they get older.  The public service already offers generous facilities in terms of jobsharing and family friendly hours.  In the context of our current economic difficulties and the costs that would arise, we will need exit the troika programme before we can go further than that.  We will also have to ensure that people contribute over a sufficient period of their working lives to build up pension entitlements.  The enormous increase in life expectancy in Ireland means that the population of older people will slowly but surely grow.  We have to balance one with the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>I would take the last five years of a person&rsquo;s working life as the timeframe for the scheme.  A mechanism can be developed to allow personal pensions to be maintained over this period.  Those who start on the career ladder with two or three days of work would not be paying pension contributions because they would be on a fixed contract.  There is potential in this scheme for a win-win outcome.  As the measure would be cost neutral I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.  I am sure she would be favourably disposed towards it if she examined it closely, even if a bit of tweaking is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I understand why the Deputy originally contacted the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about the scheme.  I am aware of job sharing arrangements in other countries but, from the point of view of my Department, we would have to be careful that pension contributions were not diminished.  In light of our welcome longevity in life expectancy and the increasing proportion of older people in the population, I have to ensure people contribute enough to their pensions, whether the contributory old pension or private pension schemes.  There is merit in considering the scheme but it would have to cover these costs.</P>
        <P>The job sharing arrangements available to the public service are fairly generous and certain large private employers offer similar schemes.  People usually avail of such schemes because of family commitments but the arrangements are expensive.  Later this year we will publish an actuarial review of the cost of the old age pension and perhaps at that point we will investigate <Col N="684" />the cost of covering a pension for a person who has retired and whether the contributions would be sufficient.</P>

        <Quest>   the progress that has been made in the ongoing review of community employment schemes; when the reviews are due to report; if any CE schemes will be closed as a result; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Currently, 1,143 community employment schemes are in operation nationally, with 23,300 place, 22,000 participants and 1,300 full-time equivalent supervisor posts.  The budgeted number of places for participants and supervisors in 2012 will be the same as in 2011.  The overall estimated budget for community employment will be in excess of &euro;315 million for 2012.</P>
        <P>Community employment schemes are part of a broad range of employment supports that will cost &euro;977 million in 2012, compared to &euro;882 million in 2011.  This increase of &euro;95 million against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing support for employment.  The process of reviewing the schemes is well advanced and each scheme has been communicated with and met by an official of my Department.  The outcomes of these meetings are now being examined on a regional basis with a view to identifying funding requirements and the savings that can be achieved within the limits set down by the Department.  The analysis of these outcomes will form the basis of the review findings which will be available from the end of March.  Due to the widespread consultation process it is not possible to make any recommendations or decisions until the process is completed.</P>
        <P>Initial feedback is that the additional flexibility of &euro;1,000 provided by my Department has helped to ease the situation.  There is a growing realisation that some reduction is necessary given the budgetary constraints and this is generally accepted in principle.  A series of meetings is taking place at national level with representative bodies in regard to coming up with solutions as to how savings can be gained within the programme.  Further such meetings are planned.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>
        </P>
        <P>The financial review is due to be completed by the end of March 2012.  In the normal course of events in any one year a number of community employment projects may close.  This can be for a variety of reasons, including amalgamation of schemes.  When this situation does arise all efforts are made to ensure that the participants transfer to other projects in their own communities or areas.  The same applies to supervisors who are facilitated in transferring to community employment or other employment programmes in their areas.  In many situations new sponsors will emerge to continue the delivery of the services for the community.</P>
        <P>No decisions in regard to the closing of CE schemes will be made until the financial review process is completed and all options are considered.  There is also a review of employment support programmes, which include community employment.  Stakeholders are also being consulted as part of this review process.  This review will also be completed by the end of March 2012.  These reviews and subsequent reports at both the individual CE scheme level and at the macro level will provide good evidence on which to base future policy and ensure the most appropriate support for participants and the services provided to the community and voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>I assure the House of my full appreciation of the value of CE schemes locally.  Our focus is now on achieving improved outcomes both in terms of service provided at local level and job progression for CE participants.</P>

        <P>The Minister indicated that &euro;360 million was spent on community employment schemes in 2011 but the provision in the budget is &euro;315 million.  Where a scheme can make the case for funding before the process has been completed, the cut will be &euro;500.  She cannot, therefore, claim that she is committing the same amount as last year.</P>
        <P>Was the review group consulted on the Pathways to Work scheme launched last week in light of its impact on community employment schemes?  Was the Minister aware of the plans to reform community employment schemes contained in the Pathways to Work document in advance of the announcement of cuts to these schemes in the budget?</P>

        <P>I have discussed this on a number of occasions with the Deputies present in the House.  Responsibility for CE schemes transferred to the Department of Social Protection on 1 January and the review within the Department of Social Protection could commence only at that point.  There was a commitment to two reviews, both of which are under way and which should be completed by the end of March.  The Deputy referred to the reduction in the overall budget, but that is in the context of my Department&rsquo;s employment support budget increasing by &euro;95 million.  In addition an extra &euro;20 million is being provided to the Department of Education and Skills for training initiatives.  We need to consider how we can best provide CE schemes where there is an element of training.  In some schemes there is a very strong training content and in other schemes the training element simply may be at the beginning of a person&rsquo;s participation and may not continue in the years thereafter.</P>
        <P>Some fascinating information is available and becoming available on CE schemes.  While I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the review, in some schemes they are paying very high rents and in other schemes they have significant costs in areas such as insurance and audit.  In some of those schemes it would be possible to make significant savings.</P>

        <P>Would it not be wiser for the Minister to complete the review, identify the savings to which she alludes, and apply that in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget while allowing these schemes to get the training and materials grant for which they would have budgeted towards the end of last year to cater for their schemes in this year?  Is it open to the Minister to exercise that option in this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Responsibility for the CE schemes transferred to the Department of Social Protection along with the F&Aacute;S employment services.  I am very committed to the role of CE schemes.  As I have said previously, they provide very valuable social services.  We need to consider the quality of experience people gain on the schemes.  We must also seek value for money.  As the Deputy is aware all areas of my Department have been targeted for savings.  However, the troika takes a detailed interest in what one might call the activation and employment support policies of the Department of Social Protection.  I am anxious that in the conver<Col N="686" />sations with the troika we get recognition of the important social aspect of the schemes for communities.  As the Deputy is aware several reviews of CE have been conducted.  CE is principally identified as an employment activation measure with the hope of a person completing a CE scheme and shortly afterwards getting a job external from the CE scheme.  All the studies have shown &mdash; all of us would know this from our personal experience &mdash; that depending on the type of scheme, that may not happen.  The literature on CE schemes regards them as a simple activation measure.  Given that the responsibility for the schemes has transferred to my Department, we should acknowledge their social role and build it into the assessment of the schemes.  Some schemes or elements of some schemes constitute social employment, which is very valuable.  However, that can be very different from a pure labour activation role.  When the review is concluded and as we get the data, that is one of the issues we will examine very closely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid to more than 24,000 parents and guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately &euro;100 million in 2011, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further &euro;45 million.  In addition, the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, some &euro;2.08 billion was paid out in respect of 1.13 million children on child benefit.  In addition, qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of 495,000 children.</P>
        <P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>I have asked the advisory group on tax and social welfare to examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the budget 2012 proposals regarding changes in eligibility criteria and rates of payment for disability allowance and the increase in the age threshold for payment of domiciliary care allowance, and to assess the overall effectiveness of these proposals in delivering on these objectives.  The advisory group has sought submissions from interested parties and I expect that the group will commence its work on this issue in the near future.</P>
        <P>Representations from parents, guardians and-or representative groups on the operation of the scheme are routinely reviewed by officials of my Department.</P>
        <P>Individual domiciliary care allowance cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.</P>

        </P>
        <Col N="687" />
        <P>Reviews are initiated with the parent-guardian being asked to complete a review of medical criteria form, which also requires medical input from the child&rsquo;s GP.  The parent returns this form together with any additional recent reports of ongoing medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  While 21 days is allowed for the return of the completed review form and supporting documentation, flexibility is given where some additional time is needed to obtain specific reports.</P>
        <P>This information is then sent for review by a medical assessor who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child continues to meet the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.</P>
        <P>The decision of the deciding officer is communicated to the customer in writing and he or she is given the option to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  Any new or additional information received after the issue of the revised decision and before the appeal is heard is further assessed by a medical assessor.  In this way, the review process affords parents and guardians every opportunity to provide additional information and to have this information assessed at an early stage with payment restored, where necessary, without the necessity of an appeal hearing.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to ensuring that those children who meet the conditions for the scheme will continue to receive the payment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>In January I welcomed the Ministers intention to review the domiciliary care allowance &mdash; nobody has a problem with a review.  Will the Minister commit that the advisory group on tax and social welfare will consult with the carers association and parents organisations on the domiciliary care allowance?  Most people are not aware that the group that is reviewing whether to cut the disability allowance is also reviewing the domiciliary care allowance.  While nobody has a problem with reviews, the problem is that 21 days is insufficient to get the professional letters that are required.  I ask the Minister to instruct the Department to automatically notify the parents in receipt of domiciliary care allowance in advance of the review so that they have a number of months, given that it can take up to six months to get the professional documentation required.</P>
        <P>Has there been an increase in the number of individual reviews of these cases?  It is causing distress to a number of people who have been in contact with me and other Deputies.  These are parents of children with lifelong debilitating disabilities with no chance of the condition improving in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I put it to the Deputy that there were advertisements in the newspaper recently relating to the review being carried out and an invitation to interested individuals or organisations.  Certainly, I will ask the officials of the Department to re-advise any of the caring organisations that the review is ongoing and that they have been asked to make submissions.  I understand they are all aware of it but I will re-check the position.</P>
        <P>Some 1,700 domiciliary care allowance cases are scheduled to be reviewed in 2012.  This issue arises as part of the review process as well and it is often indicated when the domiciliary care allowance is first given.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will appreciate, in the case of some conditions affecting children there may be &mdash; hopefully there will be &mdash; a recovery while in other cases where there is a lifelong disability, there may not.  Overall approximately 40% of all claims are awarded the allowance.  The success rate does not vary to any significant degree between claims relating to intellectual and physical disabilities.  The success rate for claims relating to intellectual and physical disabilities is similar.  I recognise that question has been raised by some people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="688" />
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I have raised the issue because most parents I have dealt with were not aware of a review date.  Sometimes if one rings up in advance one can get the date but one is not informed at the start that there will be a review in one, two or three years.  It does not matter much whether they are informed at the start or whether notice goes out with sufficient time for them to make the preparation to get the most up-to-date information from the professionals dealing with it.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that no domiciliary care allowance payment should be withdrawn without the deciding officers meeting the parents and child involved?  This reassurance could deal with some of the concerns of parents who have a child with a disability so severe that the child needs care and attention or supervision over and above that of another child of the same age.  This reassurance would address most of the concerns of parents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has suggested that parents should be given a longer period of notice before a review takes place.  I will examine whether that is possible.  The Deputy is aware that the domiciliary care allowance was taken over from the HSE and the Department of Health only a short number of years ago.  The assessment for the domiciliary care allowance and the reviews are medically based.  Therefore, as the Deputy is aware, it depends on the level of medical information and witness brought forward.  It is a desk-based review because the medical advice, diagnosis, judgment and so on is given by the child&rsquo;s medical advisers.  I am unsure whether the Deputy is suggesting there should be further direct medical examination of the children by the Department.  The problem in that case would be that it might impose considerable additional stress on families if they had to undergo another set of medical examinations.  I am unsure if that is what the Deputy meant.</P>

        <P>I take the reference to expanding and extending the pre-notice period.  None of the cases taken over from the HSE has been fully reviewed as yet.  When the medical diagnosis and assessments are made there are often review dates put on the file to determine how the child progresses.  Perhaps shortly after the initial award is made the parents could be advised so that they are made aware.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>As announced in the Pathways to Work programme, one of the five strands will provide greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for job seekers, especially those who are more than one year unemployed.  My Department will continue to provide supports in the form of work experience and training through the community and voluntary sectors.  There are 85,650 places through a variety of schemes of which 22,300 are community employment.</P>
        <P>Community employment will play a critical role in this.  The Government is determined that those who are unemployed will be assisted with the appropriate advice, training and work experience to enable them to take advantage of new job opportunities as the economy recovers. <Col N="689" /> Community employment helps people who are out of work for one year or longer to maintain contact with local employment opportunities and to avail of training so that they can get these jobs when they arise.  At the same time the programme helps the local community and reduces the impact of long-term unemployment on individuals and their families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under Pathways to Work, I am prioritising one third of the places on CE schemes towards a shorter, more focused active labour market intervention.  This will be undertaken in conjunction with the wider review of community employment schemes currently under way by officials from my Department.  The CE part-time integration option of one year is likely to form the basis for this approach.  The F&Aacute;S system has been using this system already.  The option offers an applicant who is more than one year unemployed the opportunity to participate on CE for one year and to avail of training that can enhance their chances of employment.  I expect that this period on CE will have a more intense labour market focus by both the scheme sponsor and the individual job seeker towards gaining employment.</P>
        <P>CE participants are employed for 19.5 hours per week.  Therefore, the option is open to them to participate in part-time courses provided by the VEC and F&Aacute;S.  Progression to further education and training to obtain major awards will continue to be a key progression route for participants.  In addition, participants have a range of education and training programmes available to them from the F&Aacute;S training side &mdash; which will become SOLAS &mdash; and the VECs, including evening courses during and after they leave CE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I attended the launch of the Pathways to Work initiative to familiarise myself with the considerable change proposed.  I was surprised to find the realignment of one third of the places on community employment schemes.  My question is simple.  There are 22,300 CE places at present.  Of that, a number are termed &ldquo;special CE&rdquo;.  Does the realignment relate to one third of the total minus that figure or is it one third of the whole figure?</P>
        <P>Has any thought been given to the effect this would have on child care facilities operating through CE schemes which take several years to reach the FETAC level 5 or level 6 that is required?  Many CE schemes need a longer period of two or three years.  One year simply does not suffice.  Problems would arise if CE schemes were reduced to one year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy referred to special places.  I assume he has in mind ring-fenced places for CE schemes managed by community drug teams and services which, essentially, are rehabilitative in nature.  In the review, I asked specifically that this particular CE provision remain ring-fenced, because it provides an important and particular service to people who have or have had a drug problem who are anxious to be involved in a programme of rehabilitation.  In many cases these people ultimately become successfully involved in education and training and acquire qualifications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>That response deals with the drugs places but there are others related to child care, disability places and a whole range that has built up over the years.  If these are deducted from the 22,000, how many of the CE places are realigned to the new one-year figure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>In child care, there is a specific budget within the overall budget for training.  I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the review but child care will occupy a significant and important place with regard to both training opportunities for employment in both the public and private sector and in terms of delivery to a local community where access to good quality child care and after school care may be essential to facilitate people such as <Col N="690" />lone parents.  I cannot give the Deputy the numbers now, because the review is in progress, but the provision of places for particular categories is an important element of the review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
        <P>Representatives of three community employment schemes in Wexford, Ferns, Grantstown and Tagoat, have contacted me.  They are in a bad way and are very upset about the proposed cuts.  I asked them for a breakdown of their costs and spending and I can say that they could give lessons to a number of businesses on how to manage money.  I was amazed by how well their schemes were put together and by how well they did things.  The Minister says that the troika is putting pressure on budgets and that it is looking for quality of training and value for money.  I know the Minister alluded to this herself but the troika will not measure the social dividend and that is what these schemes are about.  We should not look at these schemes in purely financial terms.  In the overall scheme of things, they are not a massive cost to the State but cutting them will have dramatic social consequences for the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister explain the contradiction between on the one hand, the shortening of the CE schemes and the opportunities for training for people on the lower end of the skills base who need that training and on the other hand, her drive to ensure that people with higher qualifications, such as professionals, nurses, skilled crafts people and so on, are driven on to training programmes that are many multiples below their existing skills base?  Why that contradiction when what these people need is not a different type of training but a job in the profession for which they are qualified, a profession for which there is a basis and need, be it medical care, craftsmanship or whatever?  How can she marry the two?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>To return to what I said earlier, the Minister said in response to a previous question that the funding is there within the training spend.  If the funding is there and the Minister is aware that the review to date has identified savings that will accrue to the State, and will know that towards the end of March, that is a win-win situation for the State.  It can retain the CE schemes and still make savings.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the threat remains against these CE schemes which have not only a social dividend but also a dividend for those who participate, with the opportunity to use their experience to gain gainful employment thereafter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Given the transfer of CE to the Department of Social Protection, its importance, the large amount of money spent on CE, the large numbers of people on CE and the 1,400 supervisors employed, it would be very odd if the Department did not conduct a review of this important and significant area of social, economic and training activity.  I am aware that many people have asked why we did not conduct the review beforehand.  Unfortunately, it did not arrive in the Department until 1 January.  Second, as the Deputies are aware, there has been a number of extremely critical reports done on CE which, as mentioned by Deputy Wallace, did not take into account the social delivery aspect of CE.  We have over 1,100 CE schemes and they encompass a wide and varied range of activities.  It is important for the Department to make itself aware of the breadth and width of CE schemes because some of the criticisms of CE schemes arise from the fact that they are seen purely and solely as labour market activation and progression.  That does not tally with the reality of many of the CE schemes.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   the number of farmers that have been affected by the changes to farm assist announced in budget 2012; the amount of <Col N="691" />savings she anticipates making on the changes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The changes in the farm assist scheme referred to by the Deputy will result in estimated savings of &euro;5 million in a full year and will affect approximately 10,000 recipients.  Farm assist is a means-tested payment which is broadly similar to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  There are currently approximately 11,310 recipients on the scheme.  It is expected to cost &euro;115 million this year, slightly up from approximately &euro;114 million in 2011.</P>
        <P>The farm assist means assessment takes into account expenses incurred in relation to farming activities and also includes two sets of disregards that are unique to the farm assist scheme.  In arriving at net income, gross income is first established and all expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out self-employment are deducted and then the two sets of disregards are applied.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the current year.  However, account can be taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</P>
        <P>Budget 2012 contained two measures relating to farm assist, both of which affect the special disregards.  The first measure increases the assessment of means from self-employment, including farming and any other self-employment, from 70% to 85% of net income.  The second measure halves the deductions from net income in respect of children to &euro;127 per year for each of the first two dependent children and &euro;190.50 per year for each subsequent child.  These measures align the farm assist scheme more closely with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme on which it is based, but the means assessment for farm assist is still the more favourable of the two.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Additional information not provided on the floor of the House</i>
        </P>
        <P>Assessment of means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is currently 100% and there are no disregards for child dependants.</P>
        <P>The measures apply to new claimants from 1 January 2012.  For existing claimants, review forms together with an explanatory letter are currently issuing to all farm assist claimants.  Claimants will be given two weeks to return the forms.  Where this review results in entitlement to a lower rate of payment, each recipient will receive a letter detailing their revised payment levels.  A revised decision will issue if the review results in a cessation of entitlement.  If a farm assist customer&rsquo;s position changes after their payment rate has been revised, he or she can apply to have his or her means reviewed in light of his or her changed circumstances.  In addition, it is open to the individual, if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed, to appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>These measures increase equity in the social welfare system by bringing the conditions of the scheme closer to those of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and are fair and equitable in our current economic circumstances.</P>

        <P>Despite buoyant food prices and the upturn in the farm income in recent years, farmers have been greatly affected by recession and rising production costs.  The average farm income remains below &euro;20,000.  Under the changes, farmers are finding it more difficult to access the &euro;188 farm assist payment, although it remains a core income supplement for those farmers who seek it.  The Minister said that the changes in the scheme will affect 10,000 recipients.  Is she considering any other significant changes to farm assist and has the number of visits by welfare officers to farm assist recipients increased over the past 12 months?  If so, has the Minister the figures available or will she make them available?</P>

        <P>As I said, the farm assist scheme currently benefits 11,311 farmers and farm families.  Approximately 10% of them are not affected by this measure because they have little or no income from farming.  As I indicated in my reply, the disregards that apply are significantly in excess of what is provided under jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  In fact, farm assist will continue to constitute a significant support for people with a mixed income, some of which comes from farming and some of which comes from the social income support that is made available through farm assist.  As I said, the total expenditure on the scheme is likely to be increased by &euro;1 million this year, from &euro;114 million to &euro;115 million.  Obviously, we have been obliged to make savings in the social welfare budget, as set out in the original agreement between the troika and the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  We have attempted to do that in a way that keeps the core social welfare benefits intact, while targeting the available funds in the best way possible.</P>

        <P>The Minister mentioned that approximately 11,300 people are receiving this supplementary income.  That represents an increase of 46% on the 2008 figure and shows how important this is.  That is why I asked for a commitment that no further or additional changes are planned in this area.  I would also like to ask about the welfare officers who visit recipients of farm assist payments.  Can the Minister confirm on the record how many visits have taken place?  Can she give information on the extent to which the number of visits by welfare officers to those who receive farm assist has increased?  If the Minister does not have that information now, I will accept it at a later date.</P>

The changes took place in the context of budget 2012.  There are no proposals for any further changes.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position to give undertakings about future budgets.</P>

        <Quest>   if she will make a statement detailing the schedule and nature of training planned for all staff in her Department to enable the national employment and entitlements service to operate effectively.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The first step in establishing the proposed national employment and entitlements service involved transferring staff from the community welfare service and F&Aacute;S to the Department of Social Protection.  As I said earlier, the transfer of more than 1,700 staff from the two bodies was completed on schedule in October 2011 and January 2012.  Approximately 7,000 staff are now employed in the Department, some 400 of whom are involved in activation and case management.  As most of them have received professional training in guidance, they have the right competencies to deliver the new service.  The staff that transferred from F&Aacute;S received training in the provision of guidance services to certificate and diploma level from NUI Maynooth.  Most of the 1,000 staff who transferred from the community welfare service have significant experience of dealing with clients on a one-to-one basis.  Their skills and experience will be key in transforming the way the Department serves its customers.</P>
        <P>Together with the existing staff of the Department, the staff from F&Aacute;S and the community welfare service provide a core platform of experience and skill from which we can develop the national employment and entitlements service.  They will be integral to the roll-out of the service pilots in four local office areas, which is scheduled to take place in May of this year.  As the service rolls out past the pilot phase, and as additional staff are deployed on activation-type work, the provision of relevant and timely training will be critical to ensuring clients receive a high level of service.  In this regard, the Department&rsquo;s staff development and trans<Col N="693" />formation units are considering options in relation to the technical skills training that is required for staff who will be involved in the day-to-day implementation of the service but who do not have the requisite level of expertise.  Case management and employment guidance are just two elements in the delivery of an integrated service.  Other skills, for example, relating to the updated information technology system and the training of deciding officers, will also be needed.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i>
        </P>
        <P>The staff development unit is actively considering all options with regard to the commissioning and delivery of the training that is required to support the business of the Department.  All of the community welfare service staff and most of the F&Aacute;S staff have already completed induction training to ensure they are successfully integrated into, and quickly familiarised with, the organisation and structures of their new Department.  The Department has recently launched a newly designed management development programme for front line and middle management grades.  This continuous professional development initiative includes the areas of business process improvement, change management, performance management and planning and will equip our managers to deal with the challenges faced by staff in delivering our new and existing services.</P>

        <P>Yesterday, I attended a joint committee meeting at which a presentation on the major information technology challenges was given.  The achievement of the targets that have been set in Pathways to Work will also be challenging.  Is the Minister confident that the extension of profiling to almost all new claimants by the end of this year, as set out in Pathways to Work, will be achieved?  Has the Minister been in contact with the Minister for Education and Skills about the possibility of transferring to the Department some of the school guidance teachers who will become unemployed as a result of changes in the education sector?  If they were head-hunted by the Department, they could continue to use the expertise they have gleaned from their years of dealing with young people who would be facing unemployment in the current climate if their guidance teachers had not managed to advise them and guide them towards work.  Has any movement been made in that regard?</P>

        <P>The Department&rsquo;s staff development unit includes trainers from the Department and the former community welfare service.  This unit, which takes the lead in developing and organising relevant training, is planning to train staff on the new services and processes.  Some 29 staff are employed directly in the staff development unit.  Its training budget for 2012 is &euro;1.6 million, which compares with a budget of &euro;1.1 million in 2011.  Obviously, it is an enormous and exciting challenge for the staff of the Department.  It is certainly the biggest revamp of the provision of social welfare services for some time.  A focus is being placed on helping people to get back into employment, training and education.  As the Department is being transformed, the challenges are very significant.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>   if she will provide a definition of control savings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[11711/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the Department&rsquo;s schemes.  They represent an estimate of the value of prevented future social welfare expenditure on claims that would have been incurred if the control work had not been carried out.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  They do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error, or any case in which a customer voluntarily told the Department of a change in his or her means <Col N="694" />or circumstances that resulted in an adjustment of his or her rate of payment.  The control savings target for 2012 is &euro;645 million.  A further target of reviewing 945,000 individual welfare claims has been set.  These targets will be kept under review over the course of the year.</P>
        <P>Actual moneys are recovered when the Department assesses overpayment in individual cases and subsequently recovers such debt.  If, following a review of a claim in payment, it is confirmed that a client is receiving a payment to which he or she is not entitled, or is receiving a payment at a higher rate than that to which he or she is entitled, a deciding officer makes a revised decision on the entitlement.  Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision, having regard to the new facts or evidence and the circumstances of the case.  This can result in an assessment of overpayment.  In 2010, total overpayment amounted to &euro;83.4 million, which represented 0.41% of total departmental expenditure.  Overpayment arising from activity suspected of being fraudulent amounted to &euro;25.9 million in 2010.  The overpayment figures for 2011 will not be released until they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system.  It is unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments, to businesses that are run on a legitimate basis and to taxpayers.   The fraud initiative 2011-2013 sets out a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure public confidence and trust in the system.  These actions will be reviewed periodically and updated, as required, given emerging trends.</P>
        <P>As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>In 2010, the Department referred a total of 341 cases for legal proceedings under either social welfare or criminal justice legislation out of a total of 1.4 million people receiving payments.  This represents 0.024% of claimants.  Does the Minister accept, therefore, that the fraud statistics published by her Department are misleading in that they clearly imply an exorbitant level of fraud that is not statistically verifiable?  The rhetoric and commentary in this regard is unfair, unjust and uncalled for.  The people on the live register are hurting, not only financially but also mentally, in their efforts to maintain their family life and some form of normality against a backdrop of this cruel existence.  This commentary and rhetoric must cease.  I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that the numbers as issued by the Department are misleading.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I am surprised by the Deputy&rsquo;s statement because in my experience, most people in receipt of a social welfare income are very anxious that the small number of people who are scamming the system should be stopped in so far as this is possible.  I hear this from pensioners and from unemployed people.  I hear concerns expressed about employers who may be employing people under the counter, as it were, and in the shadow economy.  If the Deputy has not heard this same concerns expressed, then I am a little surprised, to be honest.  Most people who are in receipt of social welfare payments are utterly honest and they receive no more nor no less than their entitlement.  However, some people are claiming entitlements to which they are not properly entitled.  I do not make any apology for the Government giving a high priority to ensuring that social welfare payments go to people who are entitled to those payments and not to people who have no entitlement or who may be involved in other activities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to cases being brought to court.  This happens in a very small number of instances because prosecution is ultimately a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions but there have been a number of cases, particularly involving people <Col N="695" />using multiple identities or submitting multiple claims for social welfare purposes.  The courts have taken a very serious view in such cases of these activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
        <P>I can only go by the statistical analysis and the information shows this percentage, 0.024%, of cases going through the legal process.  Of course, abuse of the system cannot be condoned but I point out the fact that it is engaged in by only a minute percentage.  This being the case &mdash; and given the confusion this figure has produced &mdash; has the Minister plans to create a more comprehensive and accurate detection system and also a system for publication regarding the various levels of savings made within the Department?  This would avoid the confusion that a figure such as &euro;645 million is an all-encompassing figure for fraud when this is not necessarily the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I repeat that the figure of &euro;645 million is the prevention of expenditure which would occur if checks and extensive checking were not undertaken to ensure that people were in receipt of the correct payments.  The fraud initiative includes targeted reviews and examinations within areas which may be deemed to be a fraud risk.  The most effective use of audit resources is to target at-risk areas.  For instance, a targeted control project involving both former community welfare officers and social welfare inspectors took place in June 2011.  Some 320 clients were visited, of whom 90 were called for further interview.  A total of 43 clients had their payments suspended, 18 for non-attendance at interview, 16 for no longer being at the address stated and nine for non-compliance with requests to supply information.  The savings generated in that case was &euro;140,000.  The Department of Social Protection, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue, co-operate in an investigation of those working on taxi ranks in order to identify people who are operating taxis who are not registered for PRSI or for taxation purposes and who may not be in possession of a valid taxi licence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister would make Margaret Thatcher proud.  Nobody is arguing that fraud should be tolerated but the Minister has elevated this issue to the extent that people who, through no fault of their own, may be in receipt of an inaccurate payment, are being demonised as people who are robbing the State, more or less.  She speaks about protecting public money.  It is also her duty to ensure that scarce resources and public workers are employed to the best effect.  Her Department&rsquo;s staff are out investigating malicious complaints in many instances when there is a backlog of payments waiting for people who are entitled to social welfare payments.  This is neither a protection nor a good use of public money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General said that the Department&rsquo;s current practice of including all overpayments arising from control activity as bankable savings, is questionable.  I will explain that control savings are where there are no controls and no inspections.  Michael Taft said it would be like the garda&iacute; estimating the number of murders that might take place over time if there was no police force.  The figure of &euro;650 million is inaccurate whereas the &euro;20 million or &euro;26 million is probably more accurate.  All fraud is wrong.  If that figure of &euro;26 million is correct or if the Minister believes there is more, why have no additional social welfare inspectors been employed?</P>

        <P>I agree with the Minister that it is very important to tackle fraud.  For example, if two blocklayers are pricing a 50 m wall and one of them is signing on the dole illegally then it is an unfair playing field.  Because of the manner in which the figures were presented, the right-wing media is liable to use the figures in the manner in which they were <Col N="696" />presented sometimes in order to paint the wrong picture.

        <P>&mdash;&mdash;an employer is competing with a business down the street which is employing people under the counter and in the shadow economy, that business has to compete against a business with an unfair advantage over a legitimate employer.  There has to be some honesty in this regard.  I repeat that the vast majority of people who have social welfare income support of any kind are paid exactly what they are entitled to, no more and no less.  Thankfully, the vast majority of people are utterly honest.  Does this mean that we should ignore people who are scamming or abusing the system?  We have to maintain confidence in the system so that if people are scamming the system they are targeted.  I put it to Deputy Daly that the best way to target fraud and abuse is to use good intelligence in order to identify high risk areas where there has been an identifiable risk of wrong.  Ultimately, as the Department and the Revenue Commissioners roll out improvements in computer systems and the personal services card, we will be able to do a lot more checking and verification of identity at the point where people collect payments.  We will also be able to match data so that if there is something ontoward, say, for instance it turns out that there are perhaps ten households claiming a payment of some kind from one address, this would suggest a possible audit would be required.  This is modern auditing.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are 439,422 signing on the Live Register at present.    Over 88,000 of these are employed for part of the week.  Another 31,000 are signing for PRSI credits only and do not receive a payment.

        <P>Despite the economic downturn, a total of 143,230 people left the Live Register in 2011 to take up work.  A breakdown of this number between those who took up full time or part-time employment is not available.</P>
        <P>In addition to these numbers, there were 29,371 closures to education, training or employment placement recorded in 2011.  This total does not include the 18,000 people who were formerly on the Live Register but who are now availing of the Back to Education Allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>There were 21,895 transfers from the Live Register to other social welfare schemes in 2011 while in another 16,251 cases, claimants closed their claims as they were going abroad.  This means that in addition to the 143,000 who left to take up work a further 67,517 left for education, training, other social welfare schemes or to move abroad.</P>
        <Col N="698" />
        <P>The continuing high level of unemployment and the risk of extensive long-term unemployment are both completely unacceptable.  The Government is determined to do everything in its power to reduce the numbers on the Live Register by maximising employment opportunities for all those seeking work.  We are doing so not only because unemployed people are entitled to the dignity and rewards of work but also because it will help bring the national finances into balance and enable us to recover our economic sovereignty.</P>
        <P>This is an enormous task, given the scale of the economic downturn.  Some progress is being made, as Deputies will be aware from recent and very welcome new jobs announcements.  Some comfort can also be drawn from the fact that so many people leave the Live Register to take up work, as it shows that in addition to the new jobs that are coming on stream, job vacancies are being filled even though the economy is still running below its potential.</P>

        <P>Using the activation strategies set out in Pathways to Work the Department will seek, in so far as possible, to find jobs for unemployed workers in areas where they can contribute most added value commensurate with their skills.  The Department will engage with and provide supports to increase their prospects of securing a job.  As part of the job-matching service that we will offer employers, we will be seeking to match the job requirements with the capabilities of the candidates available on the live register.  As part of the service to customers a customer profile will be drawn up, as well as a personal action plan to assist with the job matching process.  It is highly likely that qualified and trained professionals, such as nurses, will get work in line with their skills and training.   Under the rights and responsibilities approach of Pathways whereby a person has an entitlement to a Social Welfare payment and a responsibility to engage with the department, we will expect people to take up reasonable job offers.  Ideally, we would like a person to be employed in their job of preference but this may not always be possible.  The objective is to keep a person close to the labour market.</P>
        <P>In relation to JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme which  came into operation on 1st July 2011 as of Thursday 23rd   February a total of 4,990 individuals had commenced an internship and there were a further 2,089 internships available to be filled.  This represents very significant progress in a short period of time.</P>
        <P>The JobBridge scheme, which is a voluntary arrangement, is open to all individuals irrespective of their skill levels and should assist the groups to which the Deputy refers to return to work.</P>
        <P>Internships are currently available in a wide range of occupational sectors including Information Technology, Transport and Logistics, Science, Health, Education, Arts and Literature etc.  Internships are also available to jobseekers in all geographic areas.</P>
        <P>The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.</P>
        <Col N="699" />

        <P>The current income support payment structure enables adult claimants to have financial responsibility for dependents, both adult and children.  An adult depending on a claimant is referred to as a &ldquo;qualified adult.&rdquo;  A claimant is eligible to claim for an increase for a qualified adult if that adult has no social welfare payment in their own right and has means of less than &euro;100 per week from employment or elsewhere.  A tapered reduced rate payment can be claimed when a qualified adult earns more than this amount up to a maximum of &euro;310 per week.   At the end of December 2011 there were approximately 193,000 adult dependent allowances in payment. </P>
        <P>Analysis and information in relation to qualified adult dependents is not routinely collated by my Department across all of its various schemes.</P>
        <P>This is, however, a matter that the Department will examine in the future as it develops policies aimed at restructuring and reforming the social welfare system.  As they do not claim a payment in their own right, qualified adults, particularly those in the working age cohort, have no engagement with the system nor are they included on the Live Register.  They therefore have no access to labour market supports or interventions that are Live Register linked. This situation does not adequately reflect modern society and its needs and, in time, will bear consideration in relation to how best to support those depending on the social welfare system to achieve better outcomes for themselves and their families.  Research such as that suggested by the Deputy will support this consideration.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18, 23, 32, 55, 56 and 58 together. </P>
        <P>Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from &euro;369 million to a provisional outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011.  The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 at end 2011, a 61% increase.</P>
        <P>The new maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available; this analysis is published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others such as low paid workers and students.</P>
        <P>Data is not available on the number of rent supplement cases that have been reviewed since the introduction of the new limits or of the outcome of these reviews.  However, all new rent supplement applications are subject to these limits and as existing claims come up for review, (most claims are reviewed every six months), or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits.</P>
        <P>The new rent limits are only in place for two months so it is too early to say what impact they have had on the rental property market.</P>
        <P>Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not <Col N="701" />agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.</P>
        <P>Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate.  However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.    Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</P>
        <P>Top up payments could occur where the application for rent supplement to the Department presents a lower rent than that actually being paid to the landlord.  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department official dealing with the rent supplement case.</P>

        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week and processes in excess of 2 million claims each year.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.  The most reliable measure of excess payments by the Department through fraudulent claiming is by way of fraud overpayments raised.  To prove fraud requires careful investigation of the case, establishment of the facts often under a cautioned interview, a disallowance of payment by the deciding officer and the setting up of an overpayment in respect of the historical period, where that is possible.  </P>
        <P>In 2010, there were a total of 51,950 overpayments assessed on scheme cases which amounted to &euro;83.4m and represented 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure.  Overpayments arising from activity suspected of being fraudulent amounted to &euro;25.9m in 2010, representing less than 0.1% of total Departmental expenditure.  The overpayments figures for 2011 will not be available until audited by the Comptroller and Auditor and General.</P>
        <P>Fraud and Error surveys give an indication of exposure to risks of abuse on different schemes.  Surveys were conducted on disability allowance, one parent family payment and jobseekers benefit in 2010 and 2011 and the results will be available in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 sets out a range of actions to ensure that an integrated approach is taken to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s schemes.  Under the Initiative, there will be greater liaison at local level with employers and the business community generally to pursue allegations of abuse and to monitor emerging trends.  In this regard, it should be noted that some 190,000 people work and legitimately receive a welfare payment.</P>

        <P>I have read the report &lsquo;Seven is too Young&rsquo; published by OPEN and have noted its content.  Until 2011, the one parent family payment (OFP) provided long-term income support, until children were aged 18, or 22 if in full-time education, to lone parents &mdash; without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training.  Such long-term welfare dependency and passive income support to individuals of working age was not considered to be in the best interests of the recipient, of his or her children or of society.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the best route out of poverty is through paid employment.  Work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, it is believed that supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and of their families.</P>
        <P>In addition, despite significant levels of State spending on one-parent families as well as improvements made to the OFP over the years, the results have been poor in terms of tackling poverty and social exclusion and of encouraging economic independence.  Lone parents and their children continue to experience high rates of &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo;.  The latest EU-SILC figures, published in November, 2011, show that, in 2010, 9.3% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; compared to 7% of two-parent households and to 6.2% of the population as a whole.</P>
        <P>Lone parents are not a homogeneous group &mdash; they have experienced different routes to lone parenthood, are of different ages, have different education and employment backgrounds as well as different needs.</P>
        <P>Social assistance and the structure and delivery of payments have a key role to play in terms of incentive and disincentive effects with regard to commencing/returning to work, education or training and extending employment.  While supports are available to those in receipt of the OFP payment, these are not currently provided in a structured or systematic way.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the payment moves the OFP scheme towards a single means-tested social assistance payment for people of working age, which is the Department&rsquo;s strategy with regard to means-tested income support.  This payment will end the categorisation of customers, including lone parents, into different payment types and will instead focus on the person and on their individual capacities.  People can then be given, or be directed to, the supports and services that they need in order to return to, or take up, employment, training or educational opportunities.</P>

        <Col N="703" />
        <P>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these schemes that a person must be available for full-time work.</P>
        <P>In this context it may be noted that for many unemployed people, unemployment is a short-term experience.  Significant numbers of people leave the live register for work and for other reasons.  In 2011, some 143,000 left the register to take up employment.</P>
        <P>Budget 2012 provided for a change in payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Where a benefit recipient is working part-time or in casual employment their benefit entitlement will be calculated with reference to a 5 day, rather than a 6 day, week.  The Budget also provided for the inclusion of Sunday working when calculating the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit/allowance payable.  Changes to the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit will be implemented in July 2012 and the inclusion of Sunday working in January 2013.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis made a series of recommendations for structural changes to the jobseeker schemes.  The Budget measures anticipate implementation of these recommendations.  A working group has been established to advance the recommendations and the Budget measures.</P>

        <P>As part of the implementation of the Pathways to Work approach it is intended that every client applying for a jobseekers payment will be asked to sign-up to a social contract with the Department.  The social contract is being finalised at the moment and will be introduced in our trial offices in May.  It is intended to be a straightforward document that sets out the services that will be provided by the Department  and the commitment that will be expected from clients to engage with and work with these services. It is nothing more nor less than that but it is an important initiative in terms of:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          the Department committing to  a standard of service delivery against which it can be evaluated by customers.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          making the terms of the service explicit to customers so that they know that these services don&rsquo;t come for free &mdash; that they will be expected to invest their time and effort to make the most of the services on offer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Basically, there is a right to a payment but also a matching responsibility on the unemployed person to engage with the system.  This, I think, is a reasonable approach from the individual&rsquo;s and the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>The contract will clearly specify that failure of the client to honour their commitments may result in the reduction or suspension of their welfare payment.  In this regard reduced payment rates were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010.</P>
        <P>The reduced rates, which apply to personal jobseekers payments, may be implemented where a jobseeker:</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) refuses an appropriate offer of training by an officer of the Department;</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) refuses, or declines to avail of, an offer of training;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) declines an intervention &mdash; for example a referral to a work experience programme or a specific work opportunity;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iv) does not attend scheduled meetings with an officer of the Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The relevant legislation provides safeguards for the social welfare recipient in terms of the reasonableness of the intervention being offered.  In common with many social welfare provisions, the new measures allow for discretion on the part of a deciding officer, as an offer of training, education or employment must be viewed in the context of a person&rsquo;s circumstances.  Where a customer has been subject to the reduced rate, the normal rate of payment will be restored from a current date when the person subsequently engages with the process or takes up offers of training that were made.</P>

        <P>My Department undertook a significant range of work in preparing the Pathways to Work policy and in the development of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service, as provided for in the Programme for <Col N="705" />Government, which will integrate employment and benefit payment services within the Department.  With reference to the European vacancy monitor the Deputy mentioned I believe the data used for the January 2012 report is the estimated number of vacancies at the end of the second quarter 2011, compared to the number of unemployed people.  This figure does not represent the number of jobs actually filled over time.  The same report, for example, estimates the number of jobs filled at approximately 95,000 during the quarter in question. As I am sure the Deputy noted from the report, there has been an increase in the number of jobs compared to the previous year. </P>
        <P>My concern is in particular for people who become long term unemployed as data from my own Department indicates that while a person has a 50% chance of finding work in their first year of unemployment, this figure drops to 10% in the second year and continues to drop every year thereafter.  Pathways to Work is designed to address this pattern by working with people to help them enhance their job prospects and secure one of the available vacancies.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that the Pathways to Work policy is not a policy working in isolation from other actions.  The Government launched its Action Plan for Jobs with a view to creating a net additional 100,000 jobs over the next five years.  Pathways to Work is a complementary policy designed to support people currently on the live register to access those jobs.</P>

        <Quest> if she will make changes to the family income supplement scheme to allow for a more regular review of the payment level especially in circumstances when the family suffer a reduction of income through their working hours being reduced because under the current system a family must wait until the full 52 week period concludes before the payment level is reviewed. </Quest>

        <P>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) payment is designed to provide income for employees on low earnings with families.  Expenditure on FIS for 2011 was of the order of &euro;204 million in respect of some 29,000 families.  The payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with &mdash; or is supported by &mdash; him/her. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</P>
        <P>An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.   This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>Claimants must apply to have their payment renewed if they wish to receive payment for a further 52 weeks.  At present, application forms for renewal of the payment of FIS for a <Col N="706" />further 52 weeks are issued one month in advance of the expiry of the current payment and are processed in order of the date of expiry of the current payment and not by the date of receipt of a completed renewal form.  This is designed to facilitate the collection of the most up-to-date customer information to ensure the fairest calculation of entitlement for the next 52 week payment period of FIS.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to change the existing arrangements and any changes to the scheme would require an amendment to the legislation.  However, the FIS payment is one of the family and child income supports that are currently being examined by the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare which was established in mid-2011.  The Group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.</P>

        <P>The group engagement initiative, referred to in <i>&ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;</i>,  is a relatively new approach by my Department when working with jobseeking clients.  Under this process, jobseekers who have been on the live register for at least three months are referred in groups to a single location.  Staff from my Department offer them a presentation that provides relevant information and advice on their entitlements, rights and responsibilities.  Appointments are then made for follow-up one-to-one meetings with an employment services expert.  The group engagement initiative was first tested by my Department, in conjunction with F&Aacute;S, in October 2010 in three locations initially [Galway, Dublin North and Dublin South].  This was part of the suite of measures aimed at strengthening the labour market activation process under the National Employment Action Plan.  Following an evaluation of the group engagement process in mid-2011, the initiative has now been extended to 38 of the Department&rsquo;s local offices.  Over 13,000 people have been referred through the process to date.  The Department&rsquo;s research has shown very positive feedback from clients with significant increases in the attendance rates at the follow-up, individual one-to-one interviews with the employment services experts. </P>
        <P>The group engagement initiative forms part of the suite of improvement measures to the way in which people will be offered more informed and personalised support services with the prioritization of more intensive and targeted support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment under the new profiling arrangements.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 50 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>The Department is establishing a new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES), as provided for in the Programme for Government, which integrates employment and benefit payment services within the Department.  The Pathways to Work strategy which was launched by the Government on 23rd February incorporates the provision to establish the NEES and commits to a new approach to the provision of services for unemployed people.  The objective is to reduce the level of long term unemployment and to ensure those who are unemployed will be provided with appropriate advice, support, education and training to take advantage of new job opportunities as the economy recovers. The Pathways to Work has five strands:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed,</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          greater targeting of activation places and opportunities,</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          incentivising the take-up of opportunities,</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed, and</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          reforming institutions to deliver better services to people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In considering the resource requirements required to implement the programme set out in Pathways to Work and in establishing the NEES, it is expected that the integration of staff from F&Aacute;S, the Community Welfare Service and the Department will realise efficiencies.  This integration will free up resources and staff for the more resource intense role of case management and activation.   There will be staff savings at local level where customers will now be dealing with one agency rather than interacting with three different agencies in three different locations.  There will also be synergies in the alignment and rationalisation of corporate service such as HR, Finance, and IT Payments.</P>
        <P>The Department expects to realise further efficiency gains from the continued upgrading and development of IT support systems and the automation of routine resource intensive operations.  This will release staff who are currently involved in manual routine work to resource the case management service.</P>
        <P>The NEES project plan also allows for the outsourcing of some of the case management and activation services to complement the Department&rsquo;s own resources in referral and job placement.  Work on the possible involvement of private and third sector providers is ongoing within the Department.  Over the course of the last three months meetings have been held with a number of stakeholders including representatives from the Department of Work and Pensions, representatives from international employment service providers and representatives of Irish recruitment companies.  A specific proposal on how to integrate private sector provision into the services the Department currently provides has not yet been worked out.</P>
        <P>Three advantages of such a model are:</P>
        <Col N="708" />
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Firstly it gives access to the expertise and knowledge of the private sector &mdash; people who have a better &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; knowledge of workforce requirements than the public sector could be expected to have.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Secondly it allows us to &ldquo;flex&rdquo; our resources by bringing in extra private sector resources as required to match peaks and troughs in demand.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Thirdly, the payment by results approach minimises the call on scarce exchequer cash resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is to be noted however that the use of external resources is nothing new &mdash; the Department, previously F&Aacute;S, engages c 23 Local Employment Service (LES) providers to provide employment services including job coaching, mentoring, and job search assistance to the people who are long term unemployed and funds these activities to the value of c &euro;20 million p.a.  There is currently c 300 staff engaged by LES companies in the provision of these employment services.  The Department also has similar external contract arrangements in place to cater for the requirements of clients with disabilities who wish to return to the workforce.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department has a history of contracting with external contractors for the provision of services &mdash; namely An Post for the provision of payment services and contracted Branch Managers for the provision of customer facing services in approximately 60 locations.</P>
        <P>I would like to stress that the Pathways to Work policy is not a policy working in isolation from other actions.  The Government launched its Action Plan for Jobs with a view to creating a net additional 100,000 jobs over the next five years. Pathways to Work are a complementary policy designed to support people currently on the live register to access those jobs.</P>

        <P>The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  Participation on internships currently operates on a voluntary basis and there are no current plans to amend this approach.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that all organisations who are participating in the JobBridge scheme are required to abide by the criteria of the scheme including the specific measures which have been designed to prevent the abuse of the scheme by employers, protect the intern from exploitation and ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme.  These include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          that the internship is not displacing an employee; and</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, all host organisations must comply with the monitoring requirements of the scheme including the completion of the monthly compliance reports and the Standard Internship Agreement with their interns.  This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the intern<Col N="709" />ship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.</P>
        <P>To ensure compliance my Department is monitoring internships to check that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.</P>
        <P>As a further safeguard a &ldquo;whistle blowing&rdquo; feature has also been introduced where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria may contact the JobBridge team.  All such claims will be investigated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition a pilot monitoring programme has been rolled out with the objective of initially monitoring 3% of Internships. The internships selected for monitoring will be based on a risk assessment process conducted on a regional basis.  It is intended that ultimately approximately 5% of internships per region per year will be selected for an on-site visit.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Monitoring Process is to establish the level of Compliance with the Standard Agreement (as signed by the Host Organisation and the Intern).  This includes the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Has the Standard Agreement been completed and signed by both parties.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Has a Mentor been appointed, if so, whom.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Are the duties and responsibilities in line with the original internship advertisement.</P>

          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Has the Development Work Experience Agreement been completed, signed and adhered to.</P>
        <P LI="1">

          Scope for any further/additional information is also provided.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In general, the feedback from the Monitoring Visits that have taken place to date has been overwhelmingly positive from the perspective of both the Host Organisation and the Intern.</P>
        <P>It is intended that following the pilot a short review of the process will be undertaken to ensure the effectiveness of the approach.</P>

        <P>The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.  No decisions have yet been taken by Government on the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  Before any decisions can be taken, there are a range of complex issues which need to be examined in detail.   </P>
        <P>I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay on 20th   February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an initial opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved.  I envisage that further consultations will be held with stakeholders in order to further develop the debate on these issues.</P>
        <P>The level of savings which would be generated from a statutory sick pay scheme would depend on how the scheme is structured, particularly in relation to the duration of payment, rate of payment, extent of coverage and number of &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; for which no payment is made.  By way of illustration, however, it is estimated that savings of &euro;23 million would arise if illness benefit was not payable for the first week of illness, rising to some &euro;89 million if it was not payable for the first four weeks of sick absence.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As Minister for Social Protection, I am determined to ensure that the contribution of such schemes is recognised in any future decisions on the future operation, funding and role of Community Employment.   There is a total spend on Community Employment of &euro;315 million in 2012. The financial review, that I have asked to be completed by the end of March, is being carried out between local community employment sponsors and the officers responsible for the scheme under local management.</P>

        <P>I acknowledge the valuable contribution made by Community Employment Projects.  Currently, there are currently thirty three Community Employment Projects located in the Dublin 5, 17 and 13 areas where they support a wide range of services within the communities.  However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012.  The reduction only applies to the grant for materials and training and represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011.  There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places in 2012.  I have requested a financial review of all Community Employment Projects.  It is anticipated that CE projects will see a reduction in the level of grant aid allocated in respect of materials and training in 2012 as funding will be allocated according to the needs of the participants and the project circumstances.  The purpose of the review is to establish the level of need and this review should be completed by the end of March 2012.  </P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is undertaking a separate review of the effectiveness of a range of employment supports including Community Employment.  The outcome of these reviews will inform the overall approach to be taken by the Department and ultimately determine future policy.</P>

        <P>As announced in the Pathways to Work, one of the five strands of the programme is to provide greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for job seekers &mdash; particularly those who are over one year unemployed.   The Department will continue to provide supports in the form of work experience and training through the community and voluntary sectors.  Community Employment will play a critical role in this.  The Government is determined that those who are unemployed will be assisted with the appropriate advice, training and work experience to enable them to take advantage of new job opportunities as the economy recovers.  Community Employment helps people who are out of work for one year or longer to maintain contact with local employment opportunities and to avail of training so that they can get these jobs when they arise.  At the same time the programme helps the local community and reduces the impact of long-term unemployment on individuals and their families.  There are no reductions in the <Col N="712" />number of places available on the Community Employment programme in 2012. Similarly, the numbers of supervisors will remain the same within agreed ratios. </P>

My Department is not aware of any cases where the Data Protection Act has been used to inhibit the investigations of those who are charged with detecting welfare fraud.  Where the Department has issues or questions regarding data protection matters, it raises them with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Social welfare legislation is reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated, where appropriate, to strengthen controls and penalties.

        <P Just="Left">Responsibility for the Local Employment Services (LES) transferred from the Department of Education and Skills to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1st January 2012.  The department recognises the valuable role the Local Employment Services play in the activation of unemployed people, particularly those most disadvantaged and distant from the labour market and in the provision of career/vocational guidance to Jobseekers referred by the department to the LES through the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP).  My officials have met recently with representatives of the Irish Local Development Network (which includes the Local Employment Services) and assured them of continued funding for 2012.  Officials will continue to work to further develop this relationship in 2012.  In this regard and as was the case in recent years, for 2012 an interim contract for an initial three month period (January-March 2012) with a pro rata budget was put in place at the end of December 2011 to facilitate the contractual relationship into the new year 2012.</P>
        <P>As in previous years officials in the regions will shortly commence a budget bid process with the 24 individual organisations with whom the department contracts for the provision of the local employment service, in order to put a contract in place for the full year 2012.</P>
        <P>The Congress Centres are independent companies administered by the Irish congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Currently, My Department provides the Congress Centres with a number of CE/JI places to enable them to deliver their service. There has been no reduction in the number of places provided to the congress centres to assist them in the provision of their service. Following the reductions in the CE training and materials grant announced in the Budget, the Department of Social Protection commenced a review of the financial resources of individual schemes. This review is scheduled to be completed by the end of March. As stated previously, I have made a commitment that no Community Employment Scheme would close pending the completion of this review.</P>

        <P>Ensuring that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which makes payments to over one million people every week.  It is important to emphasise, that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them each week.  Overpayments are generally defined as money obtained contrary to or in excess of a valid decision.  Most overpayments arise as a result of a revised decision regarding entitlement. Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case. An overpayment is assessed for the period <Col N="714" />that a client was not entitled to a payment and the recovery of the overpayment is followed up by the relevant section of the Department.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of the Department to pursue recovery of all overpayments.  In 2010, a total of 51,950 overpayments were assessed on individual cases.  These represented &euro;83.4m or 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure in that year.  The overpayments figures for 2011 are not available until audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>In 2010 almost 930,000 control reviews were undertaken while in 2011, in excess of 980,000 reviews were carried out.  Such activity may lead to the assessment of an overpayment.  However, not all overpayments arise from control reviews.  Overpayments also arise, for example, where the client, of their own volition, reports a change in their means or circumstances which results in a reduction in their entitlement.  If there is a time lag between the occurrence of such change in means or circumstances and the revision in the rate of payment, an overpayment can arise.</P>

        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.</P>
        <P>Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of HRC.  I have no statistical evidence that there has been any significant increase in the number of disallowances on the grounds of not being Habitually Resident for claims made by returning Irish emigrants.</P>
        <P>The guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically.  The Guidelines state: &ldquo;A person who had previously been habitu<Col N="715" />ally resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.&rdquo;</P>

        <P>Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) is currently paid to over 24,000 parents/guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately &euro;100m in 2011, with the accompanying Respite Care Grant costing a further &euro;45m.    In addition, the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, some &euro;2.08 billion was paid out in respect of 1.13 million children on child benefit.  In addition, qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of some 495,000 children (369,000 at full rate and 126,000 at half rate).</P>
        <P>DCA is a monthly payment to the parent/guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I have asked the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the Budget 2012 proposals regarding changes in eligibility criteria and rates of payment for Disability Allowance and the increase in the age threshold for payment of Domiciliary Care Allowance and to assess the overall effectiveness of these proposals in delivering on these objectives. The Advisory Group has sought submissions from interested parties and I expect that the group will commence its work on this issue in the near future.  Furthermore, representations from parents/guardians and/or representative groups on the operation of the scheme are routinely reviewed by officials of my Department.</P>
        <P>Individual DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Reviews are initiated with the parent/guardian being asked to complete a &ldquo;review of medical criteria form&rdquo;, which also requires medical input from the child&rsquo;s GP.   The parent returns this form together with any additional recent reports of ongoing medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  While 21 days is allowed for the return of the completed review form and supporting documentation, flexibility is given where some additional time is needed to obtain specific reports.   This information is then sent for review by a  medical assessor who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child continues to  meet the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.</P>
        <P>The decision of the deciding officer is communicated to the customer in writing and they are given the option to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Any new or additional information received after the issue of the revised decision and before the appeal is heard, is further assessed by a medical assessor.  In this way, the review process affords parents/guardians every opportunity to provide additional information and to have this information assessed at an early stage with payment restored, where necessary, without the necessity of an appeal hearing.</P>
        <P>Finally, I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that those children who meet the conditions for the scheme will continue to receive the payment.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Since January 2009 payment of illness benefit is limited to a maximum of 104 weeks (624 pay days) in most cases. There are a number of possible social welfare payments for which a customer may qualify thereafter, depending on their circumstances. Letters are sent to illness benefit customers 13 weeks before their claim is due to expire. This period of advance notice is kept under review. The customer is advised about other possible schemes for which they may qualify, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. Customers are also advised that if they are considering applying for any of the schemes they should do so as soon as possible.  There has been a consistent upward trend in recent years in the number of applicants for invalidity pension &mdash; from 7,475 in 2009 to 14,621 in 2011.  In order to qualify for invalidity pension applicants must be permanently incapable of work and satisfy the social insurance contribution conditions.  Approximately 70% of applicants do not meet the criteria.</P>
        <P>In an effort to ensure that recipients of illness benefit receive a decision on invalidity pension in advance of the expiry of their illness benefit, resources are prioritised towards those claims where illness benefit is due to expire first.  Every effort is made to process claims prior to the expiry of the illness benefit entitlement.  It should be noted, however, that an average of approximately 70% of all such claims for invalidity pension are found not to qualify.   In order to meet the challenge of increased volumes of new claims for its schemes, the department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the deployment of new computer systems. A new processing system has recently been rolled-out to manage the processing of new claims in disability allowance. Customer service delivery remains a key priority in my department and processes are kept under continuous review to ensure that services are delivered promptly to customers.  Staffing needs are also kept under regular review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</P>
        <P>If a person has an income need pending a decision on any scheme they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</P>

        <P>The process of reviewing each Community Employment (CE) scheme is well advanced.  All schemes have been communicated with and met by an officer of the Department.  Returns from these meetings are now being examined on a regional basis in terms of the funding requirements and the savings that can be achieved within the limits set down by the Department.  These outcomes will be analysed and will form the basis of the review findings which will be available from the end of March. Due to the widespread consultation and information being provided, it is not possible to make any recommendations or decisions until the process is completed.

        <P>The partial capacity benefit scheme was formally launched on Monday 13th February 2012.   Full details of the scheme have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website and an information leaflet has also been published<b>. </b>  The introduction of the partial capacity benefit scheme marks an important and positive development of the social welfare system.  The scheme recognises that the welfare system, which categorised people as &ldquo;fit to work&rdquo; or &ldquo;unfit to work&rdquo;, did not reflect the reality for many existing welfare customers and, in particular, for claimants of long-term social insurance based illness and disability payments.  The scheme provides an opportunity for such people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive an income support payment.  </P>
        <P>The partial capacity benefit scheme is open to people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months.   As these qualifying payments are based on social insurance contributions, they are not subject to a means-test.   The means-tested disability allowance scheme, on the other hand, already contains provisions which facilitate people to engage in employment.  Where a person in receipt of disability allowance takes up employment, the first &euro;120 of weekly earnings is disregarded in the means-test and earnings above that threshold are assessed at 50% for the purpose of establishing means.</P>
        <P>In light of these arrangements, it is not considered that it would be appropriate or necessary to extend the provisions of the partial capacity benefit scheme to the means-tested disability allowance scheme at this time.</P>

        <P>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and decisions made on entitlement as quickly as possible.  Each application for payment is determined by an officer of the Department taking account of the relevant legislative provisions and on the basis of the merits of each individual case. The timescale for determining applications are dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, lending institutions etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required or where a medical examination is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. </P>
        <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective; however this has to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated.

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Plans to tackle child poverty are outlined in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPSincl) and in the Programme for Government.  The Government is committed to achieving the targets in the NAPsincl to reduce the number of people experiencing poverty.  These targets are currently being reviewed to ensure that they continue to be appropriate and achievable. Consistent poverty and at-risk-of poverty rates for 2009 and 2010 are statistically the same. The EU at-risk-of poverty rate for children was 20.5 per cent in 2010 (EU27), up from 19.9 in 2009. Ireland&rsquo;s child poverty rate is slightly less than the European average at 18 per cent. The EU rate for Ireland and the national rate vary slightly because of methodological differences.  The highest rates of poverty are in jobless households and households that have limited engagement with the labour market.  These groups include lone parent families, unemployed people with disabilities and unemployed families.  Children in jobless households are three times more likely to experience consistent poverty than children generally. </P>
        <P>Therefore, a multidimensional approach to tackling child poverty is needed to take into account income supports, services and parental access to employment. The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society.  The Programme for Government sets out the framework to achieve these aims.  Employment opportunities will be increased through labour market activation, skills training and education measures. New initiatives such as Pathways to Work will also facilitate especially those who have been long-term unemployed to re-enter the labour market.  Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social <Col N="720" />protection accounts for nearly 40 per cent of current Government expenditure, savings have to be found in the social welfare system. In Budget 2012, the Government has endeavoured insofar as it could to limit cuts in social welfare to households where there is some additional income over and above the basic social welfare payment and in that regard, avoided any general reduction in primary weekly welfare payments. The standardisation of child benefit rates announced in Budget 2012 is an important component of introducing a more appropriate system of child income supports. While it is recognised that this measure will have implications for some families, the payments that provide additional support to families on low incomes, such as child related increases to social welfare payments and the family income supplement, remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The poverty reduction effect after social transfers also demonstrates that the social protection system is protecting those at-risk-of-poverty. In 2010, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate by 60 per cent. From 2004 to 2009 (most recent data for children), the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children&rsquo;s at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 43 per cent to 60 per cent. This reflects concerted State intervention and investment in the social protection system during this period.</P>
        <P>This Department works closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in relation to these issues. The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, 2012 -2017, as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross-departmental collaboration to secure this objective. Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities in the DCYA to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of the DCYA, also have an important role in this regard. These programmes and the results of three Dublin-based pilot projects to enhance children&rsquo;s development which are jointly funded by the DCYA with a philanthropic organisation, will inform the Government&rsquo;s plans to develop a new area based approach to child poverty.</P>
        <P>Finally, I understand that my colleague, Frances  Fitzgerald T.D., Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, plans to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</P>

        <P>My Department operates a range of means tested schemes and these schemes, including the means testing elements, are administered through a network of local and central offices.   In the case of means tested social assistance schemes, the vast majority of claimants are means tested only once.

          placing the Department  in a position to anticipate and respond to changing business demands e.g. additional means factors, changes to scheme rules, etc.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The second project involves the establishment of the National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  This will fully integrate the former F&Aacute;S employment services and community programmes and the former HSE Community Welfare Services (CWS) with the income maintenance role of the Department.</P>
        <P>This project will transform social welfare offices into one-stop-shops where clients can access their entitlements and get help with planning their return to work.   The Department is well advanced with a number of initiatives that facilitate the development of the NEES. Some 1,000 staff from the CWS became full staff members of the Department on 1 October 2011. The Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes have approximately 700 staff and provide a range of services to unemployed people, employed job seekers and employers. They   were integrated into my Department on 1st January 2012.</P>
        <P>The NEES project will result in a more coordinated approach to the provision of service to the public. This will create opportunities to remove duplication of work, including in the area of means assessment.</P>

        <P>There are many activation programmes that do not require one year on Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Those programmes that have such a requirement have particular objectives and are targeted at specific groups as it is not possible to cater for all groups on a single programme.    My Department is currently reviewing employment <Col N="722" />programmes and supports and this review will include eligibility requirements. This review will be completed at the end of March 2012.</P>
        <P>Persons from the categories outlined can discuss the various options that are currently available to them at their local employment services office. These options include, education, training and employment programmes.</P>

        <P>My Department has a wide ranging programme to combat social welfare fraud and abuse. The Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 sets out a range of actions to ensure an integrated approach to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s services.    Among the actions proposed is the roll-out of a new Public Services Card (PSC). </P>
        <P>The PSC will be issued following a robust registration process and will incorporate identification features including a photograph and an electronic signature thus making it harder for people to use false identities.  It will contain personal information inscribed on the face of the card for visual inspection and also electronically encoded on the card for access by a secure card reader.</P>
        <P>A biometric template of the photograph will be created on the Department&rsquo;s own database to enhance the robust registration process and to help detect and/or prevent duplicate registrations through the application of facial image matching software.  However, at this point in time, it is not proposed to store any biometric information on the PSC itself.</P>
        <P>Biometric information is information about human body characteristics, such as fingerprints, eye retinas/irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements and it is typically used for authentication purposes.  Biometric data can associate a particular individual with a particular set of human characteristics.  The selected biometric information can later be obtained from the individual and checked against the stored information, thus confirming that the same individual provided both sets of information.  Any such system would need secure registration and identification processes and the ability to read and measure biometric information throughout.  The cost of this infrastructure would be dependent on the specific biometric selected as the infrastructure (readers etc.) would need to be widely deployed.</P>
        <P>The PSC itself can support the use of biometrics but it is not proposed to deploy it in this way, at this point in time.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the new PSC will help to reduce fraud and error which could result from the incorrect identification of claimants. The Cards are being introduced on a phased basis with nearly 6,000 of them issued to date.  A multi annual rollout programme which will involve the issuance of significant numbers of cards in 2012 and the following years is currently being finalised.</P>

        <P>While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, this Department has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  The Department already operates a diverse range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payment and return to work. It is proposed that the effectiveness of these programmes will be evaluated in 2012 and that the programmes will be revised to improve their effectiveness as considered necessary.   &lsquo;Pathways To Work&rsquo; which was launched last week will build on existing Government policies to ensure that as many new job opportunities as possible are filled by those on the live register. </P>
        <P>In addition to its existing programmes and support my Department will incentivise return to work by extending and simplifying the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme which exempts employers from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees.  Also, as part of the <i>Pathways to Work</i>   plan, claimants will sign a rights and responsibilities contract and commit to a progression plan with the Department. The Department will engage with and provide supports (such as education, training, work placement or job search assistance) to each unemployed person to increase their prospects of securing a job.  The Department will reset the relationship with employers, with more and better contact to ensure they have access to and are offered the right candidates to fill vacancies.</P>

        <Quest> if there has been any increase in the number of applications for exceptional or emergency needs payments; if so, the scale of same; and if she will make additional funds available for administration by community welfare officers in view of cuts to social welfare payments made by budget 2012. </Quest>

        <P>It should be noted that Budget 2012 did not impose any cuts to primary social welfare payments.   Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These exceptional needs (ENP) payments are a vital component of the SWA scheme and link the income support function of the scheme with the wider welfare role of the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  An analysis of payments made in the first eight weeks of 2012 over 2011 shows that during this period a total of 33,800 ENP payments at a cost of &euro;8.6m were made while in the corresponding period in 2011 a total of 38,600 payments were made at a cost of &euro;10.6m. This represents a 12% reduction in the number of payments. There are no plans to make additional funds available.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the claim made by an individual at the Energy Action conference and I do not accept it.  The publication of &ldquo;Warmer Homes &mdash; A Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland&rdquo; at the end of November 2011 proposes, for the first time, a framework that will combine national and geographically focused actions to improve the thermal efficiency of the housing stock, provide targeted income supports and ensure that comprehensive advice and information is provided to vulnerable and other groups affected by energy poverty.   My Department spent some &euro;530 million in 2011 on the fuel allowance scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package benefitting some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance.  In 2005 there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of &euro;280 million.  This indicates that whilst the number of beneficiaries has increased by more than 20% the costs of provision of these schemes have almost doubled.</P>
        <P>Energy efficiency is an area of increasing investment and innovation in Ireland. Improving energy efficiency will pay dividends for the environment, energy security and competitiveness. It will also contribute towards meeting our European target of 20% energy efficiency savings by 2020.  Since 2006, more than &euro;81 million has been expended on providing energy efficiency improvements in over 80,000 homes under the Better Energy programme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on behalf of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy, the focus in 2012 will shift to addressing those households considered at higher levels of energy poverty as a priority; such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services. This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.</P>

        <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to persons who make a claim to invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, having previously been in receipt of illness benefit and carer&rsquo;s benefit respectively.  Since January 2009 payment of illness benefit is limited to a maximum of 104 weeks (624 pay days) in most cases. There are a number of possible social welfare payments for which a customer may qualify thereafter, depending on their circumstances. Letters are sent to illness benefit customers 13 weeks before their claim is due to expire. The customer is advised about other possible schemes for which they may qualify, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. Customers are also advised that if they are considering applying for any of the schemes they should do so as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>There has been a consistent upward trend in recent years in the number of applicants for invalidity pension.   There were 7,475 new claims registered in 2009, 8,774 in 2010 and 14,621 in 2011. Recipients of short-term illness benefit do not automatically qualify for invalidity pension.  They must be permanently incapable of work and satisfy the social insurance (PRSI) conditions. <Col N="725" /> In an effort to ensure that recipients of illness benefit receive a decision on invalidity pension in advance of the expiry of their illness benefit,  resources are prioritised towards those claims where illness benefit is due to expire first.  Every effort is made to process claims prior to the expiry of the illness benefit entitlement.  It should be noted, however, that an average of approximately 70% of all such claims for invalidity pension are found not to qualify.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme is a weekly income support payment which is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit is based on an applicant satisfying medical, employment and PRSI contribution conditions.  The maximum duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme is currently 104 weeks.  However, it is important to note that each care recipient may receive a total of 104 weeks care.  This may be claimed as a single continuous period or in separate tranches.  Carer&rsquo;s benefit claimants are contacted 20 weeks prior to the expiry of their benefit and reminded to consider applying for carer&rsquo;s allowance if their caring duties are likely to extend beyond the expiry of their entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit and where they have a need for continuing income support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits. Processing of applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance from persons who are already in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit are prioritised as far as possible.  If a person has an income support need pending a decision on any scheme they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.  The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. Processes and procedures are continuously reviewed with the explicit objective of reducing delays.<b></b> The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</P>

        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which administers over 70 schemes.  It processes in excess of 2.5 million applications per annum and issues over 85 million payments per year to 2.2 million customers and their families. I am fully conscious that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.   However, the country is experiencing a very serious recession and as one of the largest spending Departments, we have to take the necessary steps to ensure that all public money is accounted for appropriately.</P>
        <P>Social welfare fraud is not a victimless crime, it undermines public confidence in the system as well as being unfair to other social welfare recipients, to the taxpayer and to businesses being run on a legitimate basis.  It is against this backdrop that I have asked my Department to step up its efforts to target fraud.  To prove fraud requires careful investigation of the case, establishment of the facts often under a cautioned interview, a disallowance of payment by the <Col N="726" />deciding officer and the setting up of an overpayment in respect of the historical period, where that is possible.  In 2010, total overpayments amounted to &euro;83.4m which represented 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure.  Overpayments arising from activity suspected of being fraudulent amounted to &euro;25.9m in 2010. The overpayments figures for 2011 will not be available until audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under existing arrangements lenders are required to report details of mortgage arrears to Revenue where cumulative arrears of 18 months or more exist.  In such cases, Revenue requires lenders to provide information regarding the precise nature of the arrear such as whether the customer is making interest payments and if so, the amount. Based on this information, Revenue determines whether interest relief should continue to be paid or ceased on a case-by-case basis.    Where interest relief is ceased by Revenue, and the mortgage is subsequently the subject of repayment in accordance with an agreed schedule with the mortgage provider, then subject to an application for relief by the mortgage holder, relief is restored by Revenue. The relevant interest relief ceiling will of course apply so that if the overall interest repaid by the mortgage holder exceeds the relevant ceiling, interest relief for interest payments beyond that ceiling will not be available.</P>

        <P>NAMA is not a State authority for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations Act 1957. A state authority means any authority being a Minister of State or the Commissioner of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission or the Revenue Commissioners or the Attorney General. The primary consequence of being a state authority is that it removes time limits on bringing a legal action specific to the purposes of the state authority.  As NAMA is not a state authority for the purpose of the statute of limitations, this means that NAMA is subject to the same time limits in bringing legal actions as other legal persons.</P>

        <P>Section 48 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides that a credit union may offer additional services to its members subject to these services appearing to the Central Bank of Ireland to be of mutual benefit to its members.  Each credit union is required to apply to the Registrar of Credit Unions for permission to provide the service.  However, in cases where a service appears to the Central Bank to generally involve no risk to the assets of the credit union or the funds of its members, the Minister for Finance has powers under Section 48(2) of the Act to make regulations under Section 182, exempting such a service from the requirement to have the separate prior approval of the Registrar.</P>
        <P>S.I. No. 838/2007 sets out the Credit Union Act 1997 (Exemption from Additional Services Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2007.  These regulations were made by the then Minister for Finance under Section 182, following consultations with the Registrar of Credit Unions.  They provide that individual credit unions can offer any service whereby a credit union member may arrange to have transferred to or from his or her account third party payments by way of electronic funds transfer or otherwise, without requiring the prior approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to be definitive on whether the services to which the Deputy refers would be third party electronic payments exempted under S.I. 838/2007 in all circumstances. It is a matter for individual credit unions to ensure, in the context of the specific nature of a proposed service, if the proposed service falls within the definition under S.I. No. 838/2007.  In addition to the provision of such services being required to meet the requirements under those Regulations, credit unions are also required to meet all legislative and regulatory requirements under the Credit Union Act 1997 including the provisions set out in Section 32(3) of the Act, relating to restrictions on withdrawal of members&rsquo; savings.</P>
        <P>The Registrar of Credit Unions has advised that a circular, which issued to all credit unions on 27 January 2010, states that any credit union considering providing new card services to their members is required to contact the Registry of Credit Unions prior to developing any such services.</P>

        <P>The Final Report on the Strategy for Financial Inclusion which was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in March 2011 identified that the credit unions have the potential to play a key role in the provision of the basic payment account and in the promotion of financial inclusion in the future.  It is planned that there will be a pilot stage for the basic payment account which is expected to commence in mid 2012. Following an analysis of the outcome of the pilot stage, it is intended to roll the account out on a nationwide basis in 2013. It is expected that all credit institutions, including credit unions, will be able to participate in the provision of the basic payment account in 2013, provided they have the appropriate technology, infrastructure and systems and controls in place to provide this service.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Credit Unions  is examining the issue of &ldquo;social lending&rdquo; and how credit unions can play a role in providing financial services and products to meet the needs of low income groups and the unbanked. The final report of the Commission is due to be submitted to me by the end of March 2012.</P>

        <P>My officials inform me that the Deputy has clarified that the &ldquo;private managed pension fund&rdquo; referred to is to be taken as a reference to an occupational pension from a private sector employment.  As the Deputy will be aware, an occupational pension scheme is generally managed by a pension provider or by an administrator appointed by that pension provider.  In addition, given the tax benefits of pension schemes, occupational pension schemes are those generally approved by the Revenue Commissioners for various purposes of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of a scenario wherein an occupational pension scheme would be in the name of an individual entitled to a pension under that scheme.  Nor are they aware of a scenario wherein an individual entitled to a pension under the rules of an occupational pension scheme can simply change that entitlement to include an entitlement of his or her spouse.   I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the Deputy is prepared to forward details to my officials (for onward transmission to Revenue)  of the specific case to which the question refers, they will examine the case with the view to providing the information being sought by the Deputy.</P>

        <P>I addressed the issue raised by the Deputy in his question when contributing to a Topical Issues debate on the matter of the EBS &ldquo;13 Month&rdquo; payment on 15 December 2011.  The record of the House shows I indicated that &ldquo;I have the utmost sympathy for EBS staff regarding the timing of the announcement of the decision that this so-called 13th month payment would not be made. This does not reflect well on management and should not have happened. However, this payment is described in the contracts of the relevant staff members as the payment of a Christmas bonus. The terms of the latest capital investment in AIB and its accompanying letters made clear in July 2011 that no bonuses whatsoever could be paid or awarded.&rdquo;   I am happy that through the combined efforts of management and trade union officials, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, a solution was found acceptable to all parties whilst respecting the above principle</P>
        <P>I might add to reinforce that principle that as informed by AIB, and contrary to continuing media reporting on the issue, no such payments have been made to EBS management since 1992 and no bonuses of any kind have been paid to this cadre of employee since 2008 in line with the conditions outlined above.</P>

The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &lsquo;Mortgage Arrears &mdash; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&rsquo; and this is available on the Central Bank website:  <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Consumer%20Booklet%20-%20FINAL%20Feb%202011.pdf</i>.  The Deputy will be aware that recent data from the Central Bank indicates that the number of restructured mortgages is increasing across the system.  At end December 2011, a total of 74,379 mortgages were restructured compared to 69,735 at the end of September 2011 and 59,229 at the end of December 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, as part of the overall process to implement the recommendations made in the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears, the Central Bank is currently reviewing the mortgage arrears resolution strategies of all mortgage lenders to ensure that they are looking at a range of appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Group report as well as other options that banks may themselves develop, for their customers who having difficulty meeting their mortgage commitments.  In its engagement with banks on this matter, the Central Bank advises that it will wish to ensure that banks manage the capital cost of such solutions, ensure that there is transparency and fairness to the consumer and also ensure that banks have the operational capacity to implement such solutions.</P>

        <P>The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.    </P>
        <P>Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.</P>
        <P>Neither the Central Bank nor I have any responsibility for any variation in the variable mortgage interest rates charged by Permanent TSB.  However, as I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, the Central Bank has advised me that it will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.</P>

        <P>In July 2010 NAMA published its Business Plan which incorporated three different scenarios and their associated net present value (NPV) outcomes over its expected life time. These included a scenario where there was a recovery of long term economic value which suggested that there was a positive NPV of &euro;1bn; a scenario of long term economic value plus 10 per cent suggesting a positive NPV of &euro;3.9bn or a recovery of long term economic value minus 10 per cent equating to a loss of &euro;0.8bn.  The NAMA Board is currently reviewing its strategy in the light of developments in the Irish economy and in the property market since it published its Business Plan in July 2010. I am advised by NAMA that the key factors which the Board considers critical in terms of NAMA&rsquo;s ultimate profitability includes the performance of various economies in which its debtors&rsquo; assets are located, the timing and sustainability of any recovery in the property market in Ireland, the sustainability of the UK property market, the availability of finance and the extent to which it can maximise the level of income produced by its loans and property assets securing them. I have asked the NAMA Board to keep me informed of its deliberations.</P>

        <P>Under Section 57 CL (1) of the <i>Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, 2004, </i>if either a regulated financial service provider or a complainant is dissatisfied with a finding of the Financial Service Ombudsman (FSO), either the financial service provider or the complainant concerned may appeal to the High Court against the finding. Subject to any such appeal, a finding of the FSO is legally binding on the parties to a complaint. The FSO respects the right of parties to a complaint to appeal a finding as set out in the legislation and fully engages in all such appeals on a case by case basis, and in accordance with such legal advice as it may receive in respect of each appeal.   As the Deputy is aware, the covered financial institutions operate at arm&rsquo;s length from the Minister in relation to the day to day operations of the institutions. A decision to appeal or not appeal a finding of the FSO is a commercial/legal decision for the financial institution involved and as such I have no function in such matters.</P>

        <P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government&rsquo;s Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November last, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 &mdash; over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary &mdash; and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary.</P>
        <P>In view of the very real need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.</P>
        <P>In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation, it is not possible for me to advance with a summer works programme this year.</P>

The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the proposed acquisition of a site for the school he referred to is at an advanced stage and pre-contract enquiries are on-going between the solicitors of the relevant parties.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, I have already indicated in the context of the announcement of the Government&rsquo;s Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework on the 10th of November 2011, which sets out the  demographic challenges facing the education system in the coming years, that I intend to publish a five year plan outlining the projects that will commence construction during that time.</P>
        <P>In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The current position of all projects on the school building programme, including this project, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. Details in relation to projects are updated regularly.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at the moment to deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s request in full as the priority and urgency for my Department is to complete the teacher allocation process at this time. Notifications are currently being finalised to issue to each DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 school of their staffing entitlements for 2012/13, including the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s decision to retain 235 posts from previous disadvantage schemes in 140 Band 1 and Band 2 DEIS schools. When this process is complete, the information will be forwarded to the Deputy directly.</P>
        <P>As already announced the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS Band 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed. This involves 136 posts from 163 post primary schools, 16 posts from 16 rural primary schools and 40 posts from 17 non DEIS primary schools.</P>

        <P>My Department invited patron bodies to make applications for patronage of the new primary schools to be established in 2012 and 2013.

        <P>For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students.  An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents or legal guardian from the October preceding entry or re-entry to further or higher education.</P>
        <P>In order to establish a candidate&rsquo;s status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate&rsquo;s address from 1st October of the year preceding entry into college.  In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority.  An applicant may appeal the decision of the grant awarding authority to its appeals officer.  Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.</P>
        <Col N="748" />
        <P>I understand that the outcome of the application was communicated to student referred to by the Deputy on 19 September 2011 and that the student was informed of the appeals process.  No appeal has been received by the awarding authority to date.</P>

        <P>A public service-wide review of allowances, announced by the Government as part of Budget 2012, is currently being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Under Circular 70/2011, teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date.  Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011.  The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the review.  Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.  Circular 3/2012 provides that allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; i.e. those who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012.  Examples of such allowances include any form of qualification allowance or the supervision and substitution payment paid to teachers, and the secretary to the Board of Management allowance paid to school principals.  The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances.  These decisions were taken pending the outcome of the public service-wide review of allowances due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances.  Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.  I am not in a position to comment further on the position in relation to teacher allowances until the outcome of the public service-wide review of allowances is known.</P>

        <P>Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative in 2005.  As already announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS Band 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed, including the 38 posts from 15 non-DEIS schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy.  Where a school is losing three or more posts as a result of the combination of budget and reform measures, an application can be made to the Staffing Appeals Board with a view to seeking to have a portion of the loss in posts deferred to the 2013-14 school year on the basis that it is having a particularly adverse impact on the school&rsquo;s overall allocation.  The priority for my Department is to complete the teacher allocation process at this time.  Notifications are currently being finalised to issue to each school losing disadvantaged posts from previous schemes, of their staffing entitlements for 2012-13.  Notification to the school to which the Deputy refers will issue before the end of this week, providing details of its staffing for 2012-13, including posts being withdrawn and details of the appeals mechanism open to the school.</P>

        <P>Officials in the Pension Unit of my Department are addressing the pension benefit entitlements for those who are retiring at this time.  The number of teachers in Primary Secondary, Community and Comprehensive schools who have applied to retire in the period 1 January to 29 February 2012 is 1,166.  Information received from the Vocational Education Sector indicates that 220 teachers have applied to retire in that sector during that period.  It is important to note that schools will be able to fill vacancies arising from retirements.  A circular was issued by my Department in July 2011 requesting school Boards of Management to inform all staff in their schools (who are members of an occupation pension scheme) who intended to retire on or before 29 February 2012 that they were required to give three calendar months&rsquo; notice of their date of retirement.  The circular also stated that a notification may not be withdrawn on or after the date indicated as the last day of service.  It was pointed out in the circular that failure to give the required notice could result in a delay in payment of pension benefits.  Accordingly, the actual number retiring will not be accurately known until some time after 29 February 2012 when the details are processed and compiled.  When the work of processing pension benefits for those retiring has been addressed, it is intended to commence work on compiling detailed statistical data on the number of teachers who retired and to publish this information on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>The staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year are set out in Primary Circular 0007/2012 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs. This should be completed by schools in March.</P>
        <P>There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools. The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc. The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.</P>
        <P>All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher redeployment and recruitment and to reduce the impact of travel time between schools where teachers are shared.</P>
        <P>My Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible. As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements</P>

        <P>As non-residents may also apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a tax clearance certificate, this document does not necessarily of itself prove residency in the State.  However, it may be considered by the relevant grant awarding authority in conjunction with other acceptable supporting documentation to demonstrate residency, including utility bills, social welfare statements or evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and other documents as outlined in Schedule 5 of the Student Grant Scheme 2011.</P>

        <P>The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The statute does not accord me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform any function in this regard.  </P>
        <P>The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches, land on golf courses, tennis courses, etc.  The Act also provides for the exemption from rates of &ldquo;<i>Community Halls</i>&rdquo;. To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises need to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature. Many sports clubs achieve exemption from rates on their property under this provision. However, the Valuation Act 2001 specifically excludes the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 from this provision. Therefore, the premises of such a registered club is rateable.  Essentially, this means that clubs licensed to sell alcohol are rateable.  It is important to point out that this provision has the effect of making all premises occupied by the club rateable and not just that part of the premises normally used for the sale of alcohol. The premises of a club which ceases to be registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 will no longer be rateable.</P>
        <P>The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a licensed sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.  Therefore, in equity, exemption from rates can only be achieved by the cessation of the club&rsquo;s registration under the 1904 Act.</P>
        <P>Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain the existing local authority valuation lists.  It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuation of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list.  The valuations of commercial properties, including sports clubs, are determined by reference to the values of similar types of properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated in a fair and equitable manner. Therefore, rising or falling property values have no impact on valuations determined at revision.</P>

        <P>In October, 2009, the Office of Public Works allocated funding of &euro;13,500 to Kerry County Council to carry out a study of the flood problem in the Glenflesk area on foot of an application from the Council under the minor works scheme.  </P>
        <P>The study report, which was submitted by the Council to the OPW in November last year, recommended flood mitigation works at four locations (a) Upstream of Glenflesk/Foiladuane (b) Glenflesk (c) Headford and (d) Flesk Bridge.</P>
        <P>Following discussion with the Council, it has been decided that providing a long term solution to the problem in Glenflesk will be addressed in the context of the ongoing South West Catchment Flood Risk Assessment study.</P>
        <P>In the interim, it is open to the Council to submit applications for funding for minor flood mitigation measures under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Works scheme, and OPW understands that they intend to do so shortly.</P>
        <P>Any application that is submitted by the Council will be considered having regard to the Minor Works scheme eligibility criteria and the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the NewERA unit was established within the National Treasury Management Agency in 2011 to reform the manner in which Government manages the commercial semi-State companies. NewERA will initially undertake the corporate governance function, from a shareholder perspective and reporting to relevant ministers, of ESB, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, EirGrid, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte. Its role will be<i>, inter alia,</i> to advise on matters such as the appropriate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment.  </P>
        <P>In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I have not requested that the commercial semi State companies pay an increased dividend to the State in 2012. However, the Government has agreed that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and with the advice of NewERA and the Commission for Energy Regulation, will review the dividend policy in relation to ESB with a view to securing a greater return on the State&rsquo;s equity in future years.</P>

        <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.  However, having made enquiries, I understand that the Tribunal received a claim from the person concerned on 21 April 2011. </P>
        <P>The Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  This has had the unfortunate consequence of increasing the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal.  The current estimated waiting period for Tribunal hearings is approximately 67 weeks from the date of application.  This period is subject to fluctuation, depending on the rate with which existing cases are disposed of.</P>
        <P>I regret the lengthy delays that are currently being experienced.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, I would add however that the functions and outputs of the Tribunal are being addressed in the context of my planned reform of the State&rsquo;s employment rights and industrial relations structures and institutions.  I expect this reform and streamlining project to deliver a measurable improvement in the quality of services provided to users of the State&rsquo;s employment rights/industrial relations dispute resolution services and reduce the burden of accessing such services for users and reduce costs to the State.</P>

        <P Just="Left">A major service delivery modernisation project is under way to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation.  The first tranche of new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer&rsquo;s allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing systems. In addition, to dealing with approximately 330 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications that are received each week, overtime working is being applied to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
        <P>While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted the intake of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims remains at a high level and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process.</P>

        <P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving <Col N="759" />this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together. </P>
        <P>In the period since May 2008 some 952 staff have been redeployed to the Department to fill critical vacancies in local offices, Central Support Units and the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate   to <Col N="760" />deal with the increased volume of claims due to the downturn in the economy.  Taking into account the numbers of staff who have left the Department and the vacancies that exist currently, a net total of 486 additional staff have been assigned to the Department.</P>
        <P>The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, having regard to workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</P>
        <P>In order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is also undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  The establishment of the NEES under the management of the Department brings together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency Schemes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the NEES will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit.  This new service will provide a coherent, integrated and more personalised service to customers and will help minimise the duplication that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.</P>
        <P>Regarding the backlog of appeals, I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that in addition to the allocation of extra appeals officers that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to source staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

        <P>I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in June 2011 to address a number of specific issues regarding the operation and interaction of the tax and social protection systems. The Group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be addressed and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Group has been asked to examine a number of issues and to identify specific practical institutional and administrative improvements.  One of the issues I have asked them to examine and report is the question of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</P>

Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget/estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.</P>

        <P>The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.</P>
        <P>A total of 17,758 carer&rsquo;s allowance applications were registered in 2011 and 13,762 were processed in the same period.  Some 7,698 applications are registered and awaiting a decision at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. The first tranche of new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer&rsquo;s allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing systems. In addition, to dealing with approximately 330 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications that are received each week, overtime working is being applied to help reduce backlogs that have built up. However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
        <P>While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted the intake of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims remains at a high level and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process. Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
        <P>The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.</P>
        <Col N="762" />
        <P>In the meantime, if a person&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, they may apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</P>

        <P>As part of the overall Government approach to unemployment, the Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. </P>
        <P>These include t&uacute;s &mdash; the community work placement initiative, the rural social scheme (rss), community employment (ce) and the community services programme (csp). Under t&uacute;s, there is provision for up to 5,000 short-term quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year, rollout of this initiative is advancing with 2,875 currently engaged on the payroll. Under the rss, 2,730 are engaged, while 23,300 people are provided with opportunities under the ce scheme. The csp currently supports 2,800 people in full and part-time employment. The purpose of work placement, employment and training schemes is to focus on those people who are long-term unemployed and likely to have more limited opportunity of returning to the labour market and in need of training. In addition, last week I announced a new initiative &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;, which is a radical new plan to get unemployed people back to work. &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; is primarily focused on those who have been out of work for a year or more. The aim is to get 75,000 people who are currently long-term unemployed back into the workforce and to reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months today to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments by entering into both part time and full time employment. The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register. It provides an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services. In addition, as provided for under the Programme for Government, a new National Employment and Entitlements Service is being established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers. This Department will spend &euro;977 million on employment supports in 2012, up from &euro;882 million in 2011. This increased spending of &euro;95 million, against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation, underlines the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="763" />commitment to enhancing support for employment.  Overall, the Department will offer 85,650 job placement or work experience initiatives in 2012.</P>
        <P>A policy review of the overall range of employment support, activation and work schemes operated by the Department is currently underway. The aim of the review is to assess the schemes, individually and in combination, &lsquo;in the light of their contribution to the Department&rsquo;s policy objective of supporting people of working age into employment&rsquo; and to recommend any changes to the current range of schemes/programmes seen as required on the basis of the analyses carried out&rsquo;. The review is scheduled for completion by the end of March.</P>

        <P>My Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments arising as a result of suspected fraud or error.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  Debt holders should be aware that a departmental debt will remain on their records until fully recovered and will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining.</P>
        <P>Those clients who are aware that they are being or have been overpaid by my Department should contact their local social welfare office immediately.  An overpayment recovery plan, acceptable both to the customer and to the Department, will then be agreed.  The general approach is that the recovery amount proposed will be the maximum repayment that the debtor can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department.  In the context of the Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 which I launched last September, the Department is reviewing its overall approach to debt recovery.  A range of options are currently being considered with a view to both minimising overpayments and increasing the rate of recoveries. The consideration of all the options has to be balanced, of course, clearly taking into account the core income support and social inclusion purpose of social protection payments and any particular legal requirements.</P>

        <Quest> if she will examine the position of people on local authority housing lists who have not been offered housing accommodation and continue to rely on private rented accommodation, which in turn is the subject of very strict guidelines regarding the maximum rent payable, with particular reference to areas such as north Kildare, which, by virtue of their location, are in the higher rent bracket, and who now find themselves unable to source rental properties; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from &euro;369 million to a provisional outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 at end 2011, a 61% increase.</P>
        <P>The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement. The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by our colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning on 16th June 2011.</P>
        <P>Both initiatives give the local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement. Latest figures show that over 37,700 rent supplement tenancies have now been transferred from rent supplement to RAS and other social housing options since its inception.</P>
        <P>The new maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</P>
        <P>As existing claims come up for review (most claims are reviewed every six months), or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits. Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation. Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate.</P>
        <P>However, once the lease has expired, the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.  It is accepted that in limited circumstances rent supplement recipients may be forced to secure alternative accommodation.  It should be stressed however, that these new limits will not cause or create homelessness for anyone in receipt of rent supplement.</P>

        <P>There were 90,267 recipients of One-parent Family Payments at the end of January 2012 with payments being made in respect of 149,196 qualified children. It is estimated that approximately 46% of the recipients are in paid employment. </P>
        <P>Information concerning the working patterns of recipients of One-Parent Family Payment is not collated by my Department. Therefore, it is not possible to identify what proportion of the 46% estimated to be in paid employment have fewer than 19 hours of work. However, I can inform the Deputy that 6,212 recipients of One-Parent Family Payment are also in receipt of <Col N="766" />Family Income Supplement, indicating that they have more than 19 hours&rsquo; paid employment while still being on low income.</P>

        <P>A financial review of Community Employment schemes has commenced following the announced changes in Budget 2012.  All schemes have been communicated with and met by an officer of my Department.  Returns from these meetings are now being examined on a regional basis in terms of the funding requirements and what savings can be achieved within the limits set down by the Department.  These outcomes will be analysed and will form the basis of the review findings which will be available from the end of March. </P>
        <P>Initial feedback is that the additional flexibility of &euro;1,000 provided by my Department has helped to ease the situation.  There is a growing realisation that some reduction is necessary given the budgetary situation and there is a general acceptance of this in principle.</P>
        <P>A series of meetings are taking place at national level with representative bodies in relation to coming up with solutions as to how savings can be gained within the programme and further meetings are planned. The financial review is due to be completed by the end of March 2012.</P>
        <P>Due to the widespread consultation and the level of detail being provided it is not possible to make any recommendations or decisions until the process is completed.</P>
        <P>There is also a review of Employment Support programmes, which includes Community Employment. Stakeholders are also being consulted as part of this review process. This review will also be completed by the end of March 2012. These reviews and subsequent reports at both the individual CE scheme level and at the macro level will provide good evidence on which to base future policy and ensure the most appropriate support for participants and the services provided to the community and voluntary sector.</P>

        <Quest> if she will estimate the cost to her Department in a full year of extending the right to short term welfare benefits, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and illness benefit, to persons who pay class S pay-related social insurance; if she has considered such a proposal; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory). Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </P>
        <P>Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and illness benefit, to self-employed persons would have significant <Col N="767" />financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost in a full year of extending the right to short term welfare benefits to the self-employed.  I have, however, established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government. The Advisory Group has been requested, inter alia, to examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will also examine this matter.</P>

        <P>The Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme is managed on behalf of my Department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.</P>
        <P>Previously, applicants were deemed eligible by SEAI for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.  The SEAI advises that there is a total of 10,382 homes on the national waiting list as of 13 February 2012.  Energy efficiency upgrades continue to be provided and households on the waiting list on 31 December 2011 are being retrofitted according to their position on the waiting list.  All applicants since that date have been informed that there will be a change in eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P>The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing, as a priority, those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty.  Such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  Factors that will be taken into account in reviewing the eligibility criteria include the age of the home, the thermal efficiency of the home, the number and age of occupants, health considerations and household income.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.  The revised eligibility criteria will be published shortly and implementation of the prioritisation mechanism will begin next month.</P>

        <P>The allocation of an affordable home is made on the basis that an individual is in need of housing, is a first time buyer, cannot afford to purchase privately on the open market but can service a mortgage obtained by loan through an approved financial institution or a local authority where private finance has been refused.  While the terms and <Col N="772" />conditions of the various affordable housing schemes and the regulations governing local authority loans do not prohibit an affordable home owner from renting a spare room in his/her home, a local authority may attach conditions to the contract with the purchaser pertaining to subletting of the unit and its use by the purchaser as his/her normal place of residence. In order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes, houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes, at a significant discount from market value, contain a clawback provision. However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.   A breach of contract conditions would be a matter for a local authority to pursue as it considers appropriate given the particular circumstances involved. The administration of the various affordable housing schemes is a matter entirely for local authorities.</P>
        <P>As announced in the Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, published on 16 June 2011, all affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, have been stood down in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. A request for tenders in respect of the review was published at the beginning of February 2012.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provision) Act 1992 enables housing authorities to provide capital funding to approved housing bodies (AHBs) in respect of the provision of housing.  A body seeking to obtain, and to retain, approved status under Section 6 of the Act must have as primary objectives, the provision of accommodation for low-income families or persons with special needs such as the elderly, the homeless or persons with a physical or intellectual disability.  It must also have in its memorandum of association or registered rules, as the case may be, provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring that the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objectives. </P>
        <P>Approved housing bodies (AHB) are the owners of the accommodation schemes financed under my Department&rsquo;s capital funding schemes.  These bodies have overall responsibility for the proper management and maintenance of their dwellings. It is also their responsibility to ensure that procedures and administrative arrangements are in place to achieve compliance with the terms of the capital funding schemes. It is a matter for the housing authority to have suitable liaison arrangements in place to oversee the administration of the schemes, and to ensure that the investment made in the dwellings provided under the schemes is preserved and the terms of the mortgage arrangements are complied with.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement, published in June 2011, identifies AHBs as key partners in the delivery of social housing. This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector.</P>
        <Col N="773" />
        <P>AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement. However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them.  As such, I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.</P>
        <P>The development of such a regulatory framework, which is both robust and harmonised with the varying capacities of individual AHBs, will take some time. In the interim my Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</P>
        <P>In the context of this regulatory work, my Department is keeping the situation in relation to the expiration of mortgage periods under review and will examine, in consultation with housing authorities and the voluntary housing sector, whether specific guidance in this area might be of assistance.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.</P>
        <P>A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011. A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.

All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives.  Issues including uncollected waste and service coverage will be considered in this context.</P>

        <P>A fee of &euro;30 is payable with a Commencement Notice required in accordance with section 6(2)(<i>k</i>) of the Building Control Act 1990.  Where a commencement notice relates to more than one building, the fee is &euro;30 per building up to maximum fee of &euro;3,800.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act clearly places responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder/developer who carries out the works.  Moreover Section 6(4)(<i>a</i>) of the Act clearly specifies that where a commencement notice is submitted to a building control authority, the building control authority is not under any duty to any person to ensure that the building or works to which the notice relates will, either during the works or when completed, comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations or be free from any defect.</P>
        <P>Building control authorities do however have a responsibility for enforcement of the Building Regulations and under the Act have strong powers to:</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) serve enforcement notices for non-compliance;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements;</P>
        <P LI="2">(iv) seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The agreed national inspection target is that each building control authority should inspect a minimum of at least 12% to 15% of buildings covered by valid Commencement Notices submitted to the authority.  My Department understands from statistical returns from building control <Col N="776" />authorities, that an inspection rate of 23% was achieved across the local authority sector during 2010.</P>
        <P>I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why, in July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>In broad terms the measures will involve:</P>
        <P LI="2">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</P>
        <P LI="2">(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective oversight of building activity;</P>
        <P LI="2">(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</P>
        <P LI="2">(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mandatory certification, lodgement of drawings and improved inspection arrangements as outlined above are key reforms which, I believe, will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.</P>
        <P>Professionals who are engaged by developers will be required to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards and there is an urgent need for the construction professions to deliver high standards and professionalism in the construction field.</P>

        <P>I assume the question relates to inspections undertaken by the Housing Inspectorate of my Department following an application by the developer of the Priory Hall complex for Floor Area Compliance Certificates (FACCs) as introduced by section 72 of the 2004 Finance Act.  The focus of the FACC process was to determine eligibility for exemption from stamp duty and the certificates issued serve no other purpose.</P>
        <P>The application for the FACC was assigned to one of my Department&rsquo;s inspectors who then took responsibility for processing the application, which included a number of on-site visits for inspection purposes and written correspondence with the developer seeking documentary evidence of compliance with the Building Regulations.  During this process my Department&rsquo;s inspector raised a number of concerns with the site engineer, which were notified in writing to the developer, in relation to the absence of fire collars on pipes and adequacy of roof and wall insulation.  My Department&rsquo;s inspector subsequently liaised with the site engineer to resolve the areas of concern and no communication took place with Dublin City Council.  The site engineer was requested to remove external cladding in order to fit the required insulation and to arrange for installation of fire collars on pipes.</P>
        <P>Spot checks were subsequently undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s inspector to confirm the defects had been remedied.  In relation to the fire collars the developer subsequently provided a certificate from CLM Fire Protection Limited dated 21 November 2006 confirming that fire collars had been installed in compliance with the Building Regulations.  In addition signed copies of RIAI Form 1 &mdash; The Architect&rsquo;s Opinion on Compliance with Building Regulations (the form for use where professional architectural service has been provided at the design and construction stage of the relevant building or works) were provided by the developer to the Department&rsquo;s inspector in support of the FACC application.</P>
        <P>These forms for Priory Hall were signed by a registered member of the RIAI and accompanied by the RIAI Membership Stamp confirming that architectural services were provided at design and construction stages; that designs (based on drawings submitted by the signatory) are in substantial compliance with the Building Regulations; and that fire safety certificates were properly obtained.  The form is completed by the inclusion of the statement that &ldquo;in the opinion of the Architect concerned, the construction of the relevant Building or Works is in substantial compliance with the Building Regulations.&rdquo;  The onus is on the owner/developer and agents acting on their behalf to ensure compliance with the building regulations, including fire safety requirements.</P>
        <P>In late 2008, following a complaint to Dublin Fire Brigade, Dublin City Council became concerned about fire safety issues more generally at Priory Hall and this resulted in a full investigative survey of the development which identified further and more serious concerns than had been uncovered by any previous inspection.  Since that time it has used the statutory powers available to it to pursue compliance with planning permission conditions and with fire safety and building standards requirements, all of which are at issue in relation to Priory Hall.  Failure by the developer to honour court undertakings to remedy fire safety defects led to the latest High Court proceedings.</P>

I can inform the Deputy that the processing of PSV applications with regard to the suitability of the applicant is a matter for the Garda authorities.  In that regard, I am advised that, where an application for a PSV licence is duly made, the Commissioner shall grant the licence if, inter alia, he is satisfied that <Col N="779" />the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence to drive small public service vehicles and has not been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Commissioner would render him/her unsuitable to hold a PSV licence.  I am further informed that there is currently no legislative provision in force specifying the offences which would render an applicant who has been convicted of a specified offence unsuitable to hold a PSV licence.</P>

        <P>Tourmakeady is in the Castlebar District and the Garda strength of that District, as of the 31 January 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 83.  These resources are augmented by 12 civilian staff who provide vital technical and administrative support in the Castlebar District and free up sworn officers for operational duty.  While the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; in Castlebar station is 2, all Garda&iacute; have responsibility to deal with Community Policing issues as and when they arise.<b></b>The Commissioner is committed to providing a professional and effective service to the community, both urban and rural.</P>
        <P>The importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime and maintaining a safe environment for everyone can never be over-emphasised and the pledge of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to continue to invest time and energy in those partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.  It is intended where possible that the resources presently assigned to Tourmakeady Garda station will remain in the Castlebar District, subject at all times to operational requirements as determined by the Commissioner.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that applications for a certificate of naturalisation were received from the persons referred to by the Deputy in October, 2011.  The applications are currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

However, I can say that I expect to make decisions on a large volume of 2011 applications in the coming months.

        <P>The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered the feasibility of regulations to require the labelling of alcohol containers in its 2008 Report. Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.  However, no such regulations have been made to date for reasons outlined in the Group&rsquo;s Report.  The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arose under two headings.</P>
        <P>Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods.</P>
        <P>Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container.  The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it.  Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person.</P>
        <P>The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General. That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  For these reasons, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act but I am prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report.</P>

        <P>The person concerned has been in the State without the permission of the Minister since August 2005.  Consequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 16th July, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should not have a Deportation Order made against her.  The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

        <P>The first person named entered the State on 12 November, 1997 with his mother. He availed of the  permission granted to his mother based on him being a family dependent.   She was granted temporary permission to remain in the State in 2000 under the arrangements then in place for the non-EEA parents of Irish born children. This permission to remain has been renewed on a regular basis  and is currently valid to 9 January, 2014.</P>
        <P>Given that he is now over sixteen years of age and entered the State with his mother, he is required to register his permission to remain.  In this regard, he should attend his local Immigration Office with his mother, and submit his valid original passport and birth certificate for registration purposes.  I should add that Stamp 2A is generally issued in cases of children aged between 16 and 18 who are studying with Stamp 4 being issued when such children become adults at age 18.</P>

The second person referred to by the Deputy was granted permission to remain in the State on 14 June, 2005 under the revised arrangements for the non-EEA parents of children born in Ireland prior to 1 January, 2005, commonly known as the IBC/05 Scheme. This permission to remain was renewed in 2007 and in 2010, and is currently valid to 14 June, 2013.  An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the second named person in February 2011.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether she meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>I am advised that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation having been submitted in respect of a minor child. Such an application is only possible where the child was born in the State without an entitlement to Irish citizenship, where there are Irish Associations or where the application is made by a naturalised Irish citizen on behalf of their child.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The military authorities advise that they do not anticipate that any personnel currently stationed in the three Barracks will retire during March 2012.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all of the assigned roles to them. It was against this backdrop, and having regard to restricted financial allocations, that the Government decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. This recognises the significant modernisation that has been achieved to date.</P>
        <P>In response to this revised strength ceiling of 9,500, there will be a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces encompassing a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from three to two. I have asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I recognise that the departure of the number of personnel outlined earlier, over a short period, will require close monitoring, particularly where vacancies arise in critical appointments. In order to address this issue, it is envisaged that limited promotion competitions will take place to provide candidates to fill critical vacancies. In addition, within the agreed 2012 estimates, limited recruitment will be undertaken in 2012. Throughout this process careful monitoring will take place to ensure that any problems arising are managed in the interim period.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the vaccination trials is that the intention of my Department is to replace badger culling with vaccination when research demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition. With this in mind, my Department has been funding research in UCD and collaborating with DEFRA in the UK on research into a vaccine to control tuberculosis in badgers.  Research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment<b></b>with the BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against challenge with bovine TB.  However, it is necessary to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in both badgers and cattle in field conditions. Accordingly, field trials are being undertaken, involving the vaccination by individual oral delivery of several hundred badgers over 3 to 4 years, with continuous monitoring of the population to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated control badger populations. The efficient and effective delivery of the vaccine to badgers is an important aspect of the research programme of my Department but no definitive conclusions as to the most appropriate bait or delivery mechanism can be arrived at from the research conducted to date. My Department intends to conduct further research into this issue and will be collaborating very closely with DEFRA on this matter.</P>
        <P>If the trials are successful, badger vaccination will be incorporated into the eradication programme. However, it will be some years before the trials are completed and therefore targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term. I am, however, hopeful that the trials will demonstrate that vaccination of badgers can provide an effective alternative to badger culling in the longer-term.</P>
        <P>The cost of the culling programme over the past 10 years is set out below (excluding staff costs):</P>

        <P FLI="0">Staff costs relating to personnel involved in the badger culling programme are not maintained separately from overall Department staff costs. However, the costs of staff involved in badger culling in 2011 is estimated at &euro;3m.</P>
        <P>The cost of the badger culling programme has to be considered in the context of the savings arising from its implementation.<b></b> The badger programme has been in place since the mid 1990&rsquo;s and was significantly enhanced in 2004. The incidence of bovine TB in Ireland has declined significantly since 1998 when approximately 45,000 animals were removed as reactors to just 18,503 reactors in 2011, the lowest level last seen since the start of the programme in the 1950&rsquo;s.  While it not possible to attribute the decline in the incidence of the disease to any single factor, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the disease situation can be attri<Col N="791" />buted to the badger removal policy. In this context, it is interesting to note that it is estimated that the animal prevalence of TB in NI, where there is no badger removal programme, was, on average, approximately 33% higher than in the South during the ten year period 2002 to 2011. On this basis, I am satisfied that the badger removal programme is highly cost effective.</P>

        <P>China is a key strategic market for Irish exports of food, seafood and beverages and presents significant opportunities for other exports. Exports of Irish food and beverages to China are estimated in 2011 at &euro;215m, including exports of hides and skins. Exports of food and beverages alone have risen from &euro;135m in 2010 to an estimated &euro;180m in 2011. It is anticipated that further growth in exports to China will continue in 2012. This increase in exports reflects both the efforts of Irish companies and Bord Bia in promoting sales of Irish food and beverages in China and my Department&rsquo;s work in conjunction with diplomatic channels in facilitating market access for individual companies into China.   The recent visit of the Chinese Vice President to Ireland and, in particular, the opportunity he had to view an Irish dairy farm at first hand, is an important milestone in that respect.</P>
        <P>The process of obtaining approval for the export of food and other products to China is complex and detailed. My Department continues to work closely with the Chinese Authorities and our Embassy in Beijing with regard to progressing the issue of market access for additional products, including beef. Market access for beef was one of the issues raised with Vice President Xi Jinping during his recent visit to Ireland. I will be leading a trade mission to China in April and the issue of trade and furthering our market access objectives will raised with my counterparts.</P>

        <P>The first discussions on the Global Strategic Framework will be held at the FAO Regional Conferences. The European Regional Conference, which my Department will be attending, will take place in April in Baku, Azerbaijan and will be an opportunity for Ireland to feed into the process and to influence the consensus ERG position to be formulated.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s submission will be prepared by my Department in consultation with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While our submission has yet to be completed, I can assure you that it will be very supportive of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in developing countries.  Our submission will be informed by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, which recommended three priority areas for Ireland in its efforts to address global hunger: 1) support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Africa; 2) addressing maternal and infant undernutrition, and 3) strengthening international political commitment to addressing Hunger.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made steady progress in implementing the Hunger Task Force recommendations. Through our overseas development programme, Irish Aid, we support a comprehensive range of programmes to sustainably improve food and nutrition security of the poorest and most vulnerable. For example, in Malawi, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; organisations to improve soil fertility and diversify to more nutritious crops; in Tanzania, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; access to better farm inputs such as seeds and fertiliser; and in Lesotho, we support smallholder farmers to develop vegetable gardens to improve household nutrition.  At the international level, we work to ensure that global agricultural research is focused on the needs of women smallholder farmers, and that research outputs are readily available to the poorest farmers.</P>
        <P>The <i>UN Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition</i>  is another opportunity to further Ireland&rsquo;s work in this area, and I look forward to engaging with it.</P>
        <P>A full meeting of the UN Committee on World Food Security takes place every October and is attended by my officials and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  October of this year.  A decision on Ministerial attendance will be taken closer to the event.</P>

        <P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  About 66,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.</P>
        <P>Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2008 and 30 June 2009 qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2012 and  children born in July and August of 2009 will qualify for the programme in September 2013.  There are no exceptions for children who are below the qualifying age.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) compiles and publishes monthly performance reports which include statistics in relation to children in foster care.  Information in relation to the number of foster carers is published on a quarterly basis and the HSE reported that there were 3,769 foster carers, of whom 3,138 were approved by the Foster Care panel under Part III of the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) regulations, 1995, at the end of December 2011.  Data for Galway is not included in these figures. It should be noted that there are a number of steps undertaken in the assessment of foster carers, including  Garda vetting, prior to formal approval of foster carers. As regards information specifically in relation to Garda vetting, I have asked the HSE to submit the information to me and I will forward to the deputy when it is available.</P>

        <P>The Government has decided, on foot of my recommendations, that the VHI should make an application for authorisation by the Central Bank, subject to further Government decisions to be made relating to capitalisation, once the level of its capital shortfall is clarified.  The VHI has been working for some time in preparation for this.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission took a case against the State regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which had exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last. In response to this judgement, the Government agreed to:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Engage with the Commission to address the ruling;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Work with the VHI and the Central Bank on the VHI&rsquo;s application for authorisation, with a decision then to be taken regarding the question of capitalisation;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Examine the legal and legislative requirements to allow for the incorporation of the VHI as a limited company, in order to address the concerns of the EU Commissioner for Competition that the VHI may benefit from an unlimited State guarantee;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Examine other options for the future status of the VHI.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government&rsquo;s plans and a realistic timetable were outlined to the European Commission on 9 December last.  Resolution of the issues will involve a number of steps.  The timescale for some of these steps is outside of the State&rsquo;s control and will depend on the time it takes for decisions to be made by the European Commission itself regarding State Aid issues, as well as <Col N="795" />by the Central Bank. The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation. The date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves is set at 31 December 2013. Should the State decide to provide the funding requirements for authorisation, approval of the European Commission under State Aid rules would be required.</P>
        <P>The Commission responded this week by way of a Letter of Formal Notice, a procedural notification that the Commission is obliged to issue within six months of a judgement. The letter had been expected and the Department has been in regular contact with the Commission in relation to the case.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to work with the Commission to progress a range of issues relating to the legal status of the VHI. It is making good progress in relation to these and will press ahead with them as planned.</P>
        <P>I will now consider the terms of the Formal Notice in the normal way and respond to the Commission within the two month period specified by the Commission.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a<b></b>range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. </P>
        <P>In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with physical and/or sensory disability.  Although the funding allocated to disability services has been cut by 3.7%, the HSE aims to maintain this level of service in 2012. Service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service rather than reducing the number of hours or the pay of personal assistants.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding best practice, training and standards relates to service matters, I have arranged for that part of the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P>The decision to reduce the top up payment made to people with a disability attending rehabilitative training was implemented by the Health Service Executive (HSE) without informing the Department of Health.  The reduction from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week, from the 1st January 2012, was communicated to the HSE Local Managers in advance of the Minister approving the National Service Plan for 2012.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that this proposed measure sought to bring consistency to the top up bonus paid to people attending the HSE rehabilitative training scheme with similar payments paid in other State training schemes.</P>
        <P>Any reduction in payments to individuals requires adequate advance notice to enable the recipients and indeed, service providers, to take the reduction into account in planning their support needs and other arrangements.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that people with a disability attending Rehabilitative Training are usually in receipt of a State payment such as the Disability Allowance.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the HSE agreed to my request to review its decision, and it has recently submitted a Report on the matter which is under consideration in my Department.</P>

        <P>Since taking up office I have appointed two advisers, Mr Mark Costigan as Press Adviser and Mr Sean Faughnan as Special Adviser, both on the Principal Officer (Standard) salary level. Mr. Faughnan is paid at the minimum of the Principal Officer (Standard) scale, currently &euro;80,051 and separate sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the appointment of Mr.  Costigan on the fifth point of that scale, &euro;92,672.  Before his appointment Mr Costigan was the Deputy Government Press Secretary from September 2005 until the last general election. Prior to that he was the political editor of Today FM. Mr. Faughnan worked as a financial analyst for a number of years in London. More recently he was an advisor to the present Taoiseach while in opposition. </P>
        <P>Mr. Faughnan has indicated to me his intention to reduce his work commitment from full time to one-third time. It is my intention to appoint Ms Maureen Windle, ex-Chief Executive Officer of the Northern Area Health Board on a two-thirds time basis, and one salary will accordingly be divided between the two individuals pro-rata in line with the time worked. Mr. Faughnan and Ms Windle will share the advisory role on the strategic health reform aspects of the Programme for Government as well as having responsibility for other tasks, including  parliamentary issues.</P>
        <P>Mr.  Costigan deals with a wide range of press enquiries from both the national and local media and from  specialised health publications and  works closely with the Department across a broad range of communications activities..</P>
        <P>Ms Windle is in receipt of a Public Service pension from her previous employment. Upon taking up appointment as my Adviser, she will be subject to standard public service pension abatement rules.</P>
        <P>Mr. Faughnan has not had a previous role in this Department, the Health Service Executive or a Health Board.</P>
        <P>While Mr. Costigan was answerable to former T&aacute;naiste and Health Minister Mary Harney, his role was as Deputy Government Press Secretary, based in Government Buildings. He has not had a previous role in the Health Service Executive or a Health Board.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <P>Under EU law and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended, existing public service obligation (PSO) <Col N="805" />bus services can be procured by the National Transport Authority (NTA) through direct award contracts and any other new subvented services must be procured by way of open tendering.</P>
        <P>At the expiry of the current 5 year direct award contract for the provision of PSO services with Bus &Eacute;ireann the NTA have discretion to renew, modify or terminate the direct award provision of bus services following a consultation process with interested parties under which the NTA is obliged to justify its approach.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government to explore the benefit to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision, I will be consulting with my Ministerial colleagues soon on the future options for procurement of PSO bus services.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the position regarding a sporting event (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. As well as bringing spectators to our shores, the hosting of sports events such as the Ryder Cup, the Tall Ships Race, Volvo Ocean Race or the Solheim Cup can provide a great showcase for Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the holding of sports and other events that can boost tourism and in 2012 the Volvo Ocean Race will return to Ireland with its finale in Galway and the Navy-Notre Dame College Football game and the Tall Ships Race will take place in Dublin. </P>
        <P> The normal procedure in regard to the hosting of an international sporting event is that the Irish affiliate of the relevant governing body will bid to host the event in Ireland.  Where appropriate, the State Tourism agencies will provide advice and assistance to the sporting body which is seeking to secure an international event.  In certain cases it may also be appropriate for F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide financial support towards the event, in return for a contractually-agreed package of tourism and publicity benefits. I am supportive of the efforts of the State Tourism Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract suitable international events, subject, of course, to overall Government financial constraints and an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any particular project. </P>

        <P>In relation to the organising of The Gathering 2013, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established a Project Board to oversee its planning and delivery.  Staff assigned to work on The Gathering are currently considering how to engage appropriately with those groups, in the public, private and voluntary and community sectors who plan to hold Gathering 2013 events.  Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s Question to the agency for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</P>
