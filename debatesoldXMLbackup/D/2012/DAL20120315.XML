      <P>We will commence with Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  I invite Deputy Dooley to ask the first question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most memorable promises that the Government broke within the first months of entering into office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldNash">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Read on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was its pre-election stance on third level fees.  We all remember the infamous photograph of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, outside Trinity College alongside members of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, in the days before the election when he signed the pledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Labour equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The pledge was not worth the paper on which it was written.  The Minister signed up to a commitment not to re-introduce third level fees and committed to reducing student fees.  Neither occurred.</P>
      <P>To add insult to that injury, the Government will make it more difficult for people from the self-employed sector and rural families to get student grants to help them to attend college.  In March 2011, the Minister nailed his colours to the mast when he spoke to the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>.  He stated: &ldquo;Up until now there has been a bias towards the self-employed and the agricultural community who were able to quite frankly manipulate their income in a manner in which they could, or their children could, avail of grants&rdquo;.  It is this bias that allowed the Government to decide in the last budget to include farm assets in the means testing for third level grants from 2013.  This will discriminate against the children of farm families and, in these recessionary times, against the families of the self-employed, who are under severe financial pressure.</P>
      <Col N="636" />
      <P>The Minister should be aware of the facts.  The average income of many farmers is less than &euro;20,000 per annum.  The decision, if implemented by Fine Gael and Labour, will put third level education beyond the reach of many people in those particular sectors.  Does the Minister not agree that eligibility should be based on income alone and not include the value of capital assets, as the latter does not give a true picture of income or ability to pay?  The Government and the Minister admitted the mistakes made in respect of DEIS schools.  I ask him to give the same consideration to this issue with a view to reversing the decision at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question, as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on this matter and to allay fears, particularly in the agricultural community, which is experiencing a spectacular year of performance under this Government.  We hope it will continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as the 1990s when Mrs. Niamh Bhreathnach was the Minister for Education, a commission chaired by Dr. D&oacute;nal de Butl&eacute;ir reported on equality among people accessing third level grants to participate in third level education.  There was found to be a discrimination against PAYE workers and others compared with the self-employed, including members of the farming community.  The Deputy will probably be <Col N="637" />interested in knowing that the largest beneficiaries of grants are the children of the self-employed, not members of the farming community.</P>
      <P>We are seeking equality.  A capital assets test and means testing system are fair.  To minimise bureaucracy, we are trying to put in place the same means testing arrangement for health services, social protection and education.  Work is proceeding along those lines.  No document has been produced for me yet, but we will examine it when it is produced and the D&aacute;il will discuss the matter before any final decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister stated that this matter first came to light during the tenure of the former Labour Minister for Education.  Clearly, it has been Labour policy to target rural Ireland and the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldNash">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Accuracy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.  Their education is supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister does not understand, but if he had a clear understanding of the assets associated with farmers or the self-employed, he would know that they are used to generate income and should not in any sense be factored in as representing income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that why the former Government took the installation and early retirement schemes from farmers?  They amounted to &euro;30,000 per family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>Those assets cannot be sold or used to generate an income other than the income that is already being derived from them.  It is wrong of the Minister to continue as he has been.  Regardless of an individual&rsquo;s background, be it self-employed or farming, his or her income is based on the returns submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  This is the only fair and equitable method and is the approach taken in respect of PAYE workers.  I do not accept that we can have a different set of rules for the self-employed.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that there may be a greater number of people in the self-employed sector than there is in the farming sector, but many of them are small business owners who are under severe financial pressure in the current climate.  Farming is enjoying a relatively positive phase in its economic cycle but for the past five to seven years farmers were put to the pin of their collar and were losing money.  It would be more beneficial to concentrate on verifiable incomes as provided to the Revenue Commissioners rather than seek to impose penalties based on the value of assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Deputy has sought to scaremonger once again.  There is no attack on rural Ireland or the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>What about small schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no attack on any self-employed group of people.  We are looking for fairness and the way in which the Deputy is protesting suggests that he realises that the current system is not fair.  This will be done objectively and the conclusions will be published so that we can debate them in this House.  The Deputy can then decide whether it is fair or an attack on rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is continuously attacking rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the High Court gave leave to an individual to challenge the implementation of the household tax.  In the Government&rsquo;s haste to obey the diktats of the so-called European partners in paying unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders and picking the pockets of hard-pressed citizens through the implementation of unjust and unfair taxes, it forgot to translate the legislation into our national language.  In light of the High Court ruling, coupled with the fact that an overwhelming number of people, myself included, have chosen not to register or pay this unjust tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People who are receiving mortgage interest supplement, those who live in social housing or on certain unfinished ghost estates and the commercial properties and premises owned by charities will be exempt from the charge.  A large number of exemptions have been designed to ensure people who have difficulty meeting their commitments will not have to pay.  It is a fair charge as far as we are concerned and it is necessary because of the state of the national finances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Few people listening to this morning&rsquo;s debate believe what the Minister is saying.  Despite what he may think, people are not stupid.  Funding for local authorities has already been cut by this Government and this is an issue of fairness.  The Minister claims the tax is fair but that is contrary to what the Taoiseach and his own party leader has said.  Both of them have acknowledged this is an unfair tax.  The Minister asserts that legislators have a responsibility to uphold the law.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the plight of our senior citizens during this major economic crisis.  We all acknowledge the massive contribution senior citizens have made to this country.  They have worked hard and paid their taxes for many years.  The programme for Government prioritises investment in care for older people in community and residential settings.  Why is the Government ignoring that commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney">

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>

      <P>Two matters arise.  Several years ago a document was published entitled Better Regulation which aimed to ensure that legislation would be approached in a different way.  For example, it was proposed that a regulatory impact assessment would be produced and that the heads of all Bills would be published in advance to allow a full discussion in committee.</P>

      <P>With this in mind, have the heads of the Further Education and Training Authority (SOLAS) Bill been passed by Cabinet?  Will they be published in <Col N="647" />advance of the Bill given the urgency involved?  Will the Minister be more specific about the timeframe indicated rather than simply stating that it is expected this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to bring a memorandum for Government at the end of this month on the SOLAS legislation.  Then we will move to the drafting stage.  It is my intention to do with this legislation what I did with the local education and training board legislation, that is, to publish the heads in advance.  That turned out to be a constructive and productive way of engaging not only with the Oireachtas but with the wider partners.</P>

      <P>The Minister has only published a consultation paper on the Water Services (Amendment) Act with regard to the regulations that will apply for the inspection of septic tanks.  During the week the Department appears to have been able to identify those households which will be targeted for inspection this year.  A large number of homes in Donegal have already been targeted for inspection.  However, the Government has been unable to specify what regulations these homes must comply with.  Will the Minister provide an update?  Since the Department is capable of publishing a list of those targeted, when will people be clear about what regulations they will be inspected under?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been enacted.  I understand regulations are required subsequently.  I am unsure about it and I must get back to the Deputy on the matter but I presume this is part of a process and the regulations will be published and made available for everyone to see.</P>

    <Title>Symphysiotomy: Statements</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly">
      <TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to explain to the House precisely what symphysiotomy is and to give some context about its use as a medical procedure and specifically its use in Ireland.  Symphysiotomy is a medical procedure that was used primarily before the advent of safe caesarean sections.  The procedure was carried out in Ireland from approximately 1920 until the early 1980s.  It was gradually replaced by caesarean section as the preferred method of delivery in childbirth where required.  It is clear that the procedure continued to be used in Ireland for some time after it had been all but discontinued in other developed countries.  In this regard within Ireland it continued to be used for a longer period, most notably in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the distress that symphysiotomy has caused to a number of women and recognise the pain that this issue has caused to those affected by it.  The Government is committed to dealing with it sensitively, so that if at all possible, closure can be brought to those affected by it.  This practice has resulted in long-term distress and pain, problems with urinary continence, problems with bowel function and difficulty walking to perform day to day duties within the home.  It has had a serious effect on a number of women who have had the procedure performed.</P>
      <P>My first priority is to make sure that the health needs of those who have had a symphysiotomy are met quickly and effectively.  With this in mind, I am committed to ensuring that the greatest possible supports and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure.  The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place including the provision of medical cards to all who requested them; the nomination of a liaison officer for a patients&rsquo; group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure; the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients; the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up for women, including medical assessment, gynaecological assessment, orthopaedic assessment, counselling, physiotherapy, reflexology, <Col N="648" />home help, acupuncture, osteopathy and fast tracked hospital appointments; the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication and private treatments; the establishment of a triple assessment service for patients at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin, in January 2005; and a support group facilitated by a counsellor which was set up in 2004 in Dundalk and Drogheda for women living in the north-east region.</P>
      <P>The provision of these necessary support services for women is monitored and overseen by the Health Service Executive which is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who underwent a symphysiotomy and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that some 1,500 symphysiotomies took place during the period 1944 to 1992, giving a rate of approximately six symphysiotomies per 10,000 births.  While there was a large variation, even in the hospital with the highest rates, the maximum rate appears to have been six per 1,000 births in one year.  Thus, it was a rare intervention in comparison with caesarean section, for example, which rose steadily in the same period from three per 100 births in the early 1940s to now over 20 per 100 births.  This is not in any way to minimise any serious effects and suffering it had on the women concerned, but it does indicate the procedure was quite rarely carried out in Ireland overall.</P>
      <P>We need to act on the basis of the best evidence that is available on this issue, as in all aspects of our health services.  To this end the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health commissioned an independent research report last year into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  The aim of the report is to provide an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland, and an examination of the Irish practice relative to other countries.  It is to include an assessment of the circumstances in which the procedure was carried out, what protocols or guidance existed at the time to guide professional practice and details of when the practice changed and why.</P>
      <P>The specific terms of reference the researcher has been given are to document the rates of symphysiotomy and maternal mortality in Ireland from 1940 to date, by reference to available data, including annual and other reports; and to assess symphysiotomy rates against maternal mortality rates over the period.  The researcher has also been asked to critically appraise international reviews of symphysiotomy practice and associated rates in a number of comparable countries in the world and in Ireland, to review any guidelines and protocols that applied in Ireland on symphysiotomy over the time period and to write a report based on the findings of the analysis providing an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland and an examination of the Irish experience relative to other countries.  The academic researcher concerned was formally appointed on 1 June 2011.</P>
      <P>On a point of information, she experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and, as a result, submitted the report behind schedule in late January 2012.  She informed the Department this was due primarily to the challenges associated with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept.  Subject to legal advice, I propose to make the draft report available for consultation and will further engage with the relevant patients&rsquo; representative bodies concerned and through them the women who underwent symphysiotomy.  My Department will also consult with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland.  When these consultations have been completed satisfactorily, the draft report will then be finalised by the academic researcher, taking account of the consultative process and any legal considerations, and presented to me.  Informed by the outcomes of the consultation process, I will then consider the final report thus produced by the researcher and decide on the steps required to address this situation.</P>
      <Col N="649" />
      <P>Ireland is now one of the safest places to have a baby.  We have one of the lowest maternal mortality rates and perinatal mortality rates in the world.  Ireland is a now a very safe place to have a caesarean section and we should be proud of the fact that we are recognised internationally as leaders in the field of obstetrics.  Recent legislation requires doctors to maintain and update their competence.  These new requirements for doctors to maintain their professional competence are a significant step and a concrete assurance that medical practitioners are appropriately qualified and competent to practise safely.  With the advent of new clinical programmes and directors, there is now much greater monitoring across each specialty.</P>
      <P>The national clinical effectiveness guidelines published last year provide a framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and audit to optimise patient care.  These guidelines will contribute to improving health outcomes, by reducing variation in practice, improving quality of clinical decisions, influencing health service policy and informing service users and the public about the service they should be receiving.  These and many other developments ensure that the health system is striving to fulfil the vision of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance &mdash; knowledgeable patients receiving safe and effective care from skilled professionals in appropriate environments with assessed outcomes.  In other words it aims to empower patients more to know what is safe, to what they are entitled and what they should expect and to empower them to complain when that does not happen or they do not receive that care.</P>
      <P>The new clinical programmes being developed and implemented in the HSE are one of the most important developments in this regards.  These are currently led in the HSE by the directorate of clinical strategy and programmes which was established to improve and standardise patient care throughout the Health Service Executive by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to every user of HSE services.  Very often we have excellence in practice in an area which can be translated to a different discipline.  The interaction that now occurs between the clinical programmes is already yielding great benefit.  The clinical programmes are a multidisciplinary initiative between the HSE and the various faculties and generally include patient representatives.  Each programme is led by a clinician.  The clinical programmes are a sea change in the way we provide health care in Ireland.  This new approach utilises key proven drivers of success in improving disease management and is aimed at improving patient care.</P>
      <P>The obstetrics and gynaecological clinical programme is led by Professor Michael Turner.  The aim of the programme is to improve health care choices for women.  Its initial work aims to implement key guidelines, establish local programme implementation groups to facilitate change, develop national models of maternity care, develop a standard approach to capturing and reporting audit and performance metrics, develop solutions and guidelines to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies requiring neonatal intensive care, develop workforce planning and training models and strategy and investigate the numbers of women attending for antenatal care in early pregnancy.</P>
      <P>More generally, there has been considerable progress in the options of maternity care available to expectant mothers in Ireland.  They now have a number of choices they can make in respect of the obstetric care they choose.  Women may opt for a combined care package with their GP and the hospital, under the maternity and infant care scheme which provides a number of free GP and maternity hospital visits to all eligible expectant mothers.  There are also a number of midwifery-led units nationally which offer the opportunity to expectant mothers to give birth in a uniquely designed birth room cared for by a team of experienced midwives.  These units are located close to hospitals should an emergency arise that requires specialist intervention.</P>
      <Col N="650" />
      <P>I commend developments in the south of the country, which I would like to see extended, where the maternity service is delivered entirely in the community, with GP and consultant visits being held in the local primary care centre.  This is the practice in Mitchelstown, for example.</P>
      <P>While these developments can bring further improvements to maternity services in the future, I am committed to addressing the issues that have arisen from the legacy of past practice in relation to symphysiotomy.  The Government is also committed to dealing with this whole issue, with all the sensitivity which is undoubtedly required, to help do whatever can be done for those affected by it.  I have outlined the supports that have been provided to the women affected and the progress in finalising the research report, but I am aware that much remains to be done.  I know there is cross-party support for this group of women who have suffered as a consequence of this procedure.  It is the role of the Government and of this House to support them in reaching closure on this matter and to ensure that they receive the service they require to help them recover and lead as normal a life as is possible.</P>
      <P>I hope to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible and I firmly believe that the women who have had this procedure deserve nothing less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The Minister, as a medical practitioner, will have dealt with these sensitive issues on a confidential basis.  As a lay person, however, when I met survivors of symphysiotomy in the AV room last evening I was very disturbed by their sad stories, as were many other Members.  Their stories were emotive, disturbing and upsetting for non-medical people.  Anyone who was present last night must acknowledge that deep hurt and pain has been borne by these women for many years with great grace.  They simply got on with their lives and suffered urinary tract infections, bowel difficulties, difficulty in walking and psychological difficulties as a result of this procedure.</P>
      <P>I am not here to be judge or jury or to apportion innocence of guilt, but I have the capacity to know what is right and what is wrong.  The issue of whether or not medical practice at the time was in support of symphysiotomy on some occasions could be debated for evermore.  Some medical practitioners will go to their graves stating that the practice was carried out for the right reasons at the time.  Equally, the women on whom the procedure was carried out say it was often done for the wrong reasons.  They told me last night that there was an undercurrent of religious ethos in medical practice and that use of the procedure was concentrated in some areas of the country, in certain hospitals and among some individuals.</P>
      <P>Given what we heard last night and what the Minister and Members of the House are aware of, we owe it to the women to have a full and frank discussion on this matter.  The report will be published in the near future, and I look forward to its being discussed.  This will not be an end in itself, however.  While we can continue to provide care and support, the women and their families believe they were wronged.  I too believe they were wronged.  This is not simply because they suffered a medical practice that was accepted at the time but because alternatives were available and were being practised in hospitals in the same vicinity.  Across Europe Caesarian section was used in preference to symphysiotomy.</P>
      <Col N="651" />
      <P>For all those reasons, we owe it to these women to have a discussion on foot of the report.  I hope it can be published as soon as possible.  I say this because many of the women concerned are in the latter stages of their lives.  The way they spoke last night indicated the urgency of this matter.   I was shattered last night when I left the AV room.  I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for pursuing this issue vigorously and in an all-party and non-partisan way.</P>
      <P>We should publish the report quickly.  It should not sit around.  Let us have a genuine discussion, in parliament and in society, and see how we can formally make redress to the women who feel so aggrieved and are in such distress.  While the report will document the number of symphysiotomies carried out from 1940 to the present and will contain other detail, the real issue is the higher incidence of the procedure in some hospitals and by some individuals.  Was this because some doctors genuinely believed it was the only possible medical intervention or were there other reasons?  This is an important factor.  People told me last night that symphysiotomy was used because the view at the time was that one could have only a limited number of Caesarian sections, in which case family planning would have to be discussed.  A woman who had a number of Caesarian sections would have to use birth control to avoid a further pregnancy.  I do not know if that is the case but it is what was said to me last night in the AV room.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what has happened in the lifetime of these women and what we have today.  While we argue across the floor of this House about hospital waiting lists, lack of services and people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, we can be very proud of our maternity services, our infant mortality rates and levels of care in gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics.  We can be proud of what we have achieved and that we provide the best care to women during pregnancy and birth and to mothers and children.  However, the issue we are discussing this morning is not something we can be proud of.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged the distress of these women and that they deserve whatever we can do for them.  There are individual care packages.  They can access medical cards, if requested.  Physiotherapy and other supports are available.  Some of the women tell me that does not always happen.  The decision was made some years ago that it would happen.  If it is not happening, the Minister should make sure the women get what they are entitled to under agreements made previously.</P>
      <P>However, that is not enough.  The women deserve an acknowledgment of what was carried out.  I am not here to apportion guilt or innocence.  I vehemently opposed the referendum to establish committees of inquiry in the Oireachtas.  I do not have the competence or skill set to apportion guilt or innocence but I have the ability, as a person and as a parliamentarian, to say what I feel is right or wrong.  It is right that these women deserve an apology.  They deserve all the supports possible and they certainly deserve a full investigation &mdash; which this report may provide &mdash; of the reason this procedure was carried out more frequently over and above all the various comparable medical statistics in other hospitals in Ireland and across westernEurope.</P>
      <P>I have acknowledged Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s deep, profound commitment and interest in this issue and there has been no partisan party political attitude to this issue from any side.  I hope the report can be published soon as this would allow it to be discussed in committee or in another plenary session.  As was discussed with regard to the Bill on the blood clotting factor, people aggrieved by their treatment by the State deserve to be involved in all aspects of the decision-making process, either as individuals or collectively.</P>
      <P>Once the report is published we need to move quickly because some of these procedures were carried out a long time ago and some of the women who spoke to me last night are now in their early 80s.  They described openly the impact of this procedure on their lives, and on <Col N="652" />the lives of their families and their siblings.  It was a very harrowing story of distress.  Most of these women just got on with their lives, rearing their families and working in very difficult times in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  For all those reasons, they deserve whatever we can do for them.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is concerned about any revisionism in the context of health practices and procedures, medical technology and medicines of the time.  I accept that the practices of the past cannot be fairly compared with modern practices and we should not judge people who applied the standards of the time by the standards of our time.  However, it is a fact that the incidence of symphysiotomy was higher in some areas and in some hospitals and I cannot understand why this was the case until the early 1980s.  I cannot understand why there was not some form of peer review of practice which might, at least, have sounded the alarm.</P>
      <P>We must make every effort to support the victims and survivors of symphysiotomy with regard to their medical needs and with emotional and psychological issues which need to be addressed as such distress can never be fully assessed but the women should be entitled to support.</P>
      <P>Some of the women were concerned by what the Minister said but today&rsquo;s statement is more measured.  This is not intended as a criticism but rather I am a lay person and I do not have expertise in that area.  However, it is important that this report is seen to be a completely all-party report.  I hope consensus can be achieved in this regard and I will be fair and reasonable in my response because the people who are in the Gallery are those who deserve a fair and reasonable response.  I remember also those who were unable to attend today because of the difficulties associated with their age profile.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider how the women affected can be best helped in a practical way so that they will all receive the full care and attention to which they are entitled and this is an all-party policy.  I ask the Minister to give priority to the publication of the report because some people cannot wait and nobody deserves to wait to hear about this very difficult and sad episode.  The country has wonderful health facilities with caring and attentive staff who are dedicated to the care of their patients.  I would not want this emotive issue to diminish the confidence of mothers with regard to maternity facilities.  I urge the Minister to bring this difficult episode to a conclusion as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I will share time with my colleague, Deputy McLellan, and I will take ten minutes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is both a sad and an historic occasion, the first time that the D&aacute;il has had statements on the use of symphysiotomy and pubiotomy, that barbaric practice which inflicted so much pain, distress and disability on so many Irish women.  Our debate today is tinged with sadness as we think of those women victims and survivors of symphysiotomy who are no longer with us, suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; d&aacute; n-anamacha go l&eacute;ir.  It is sad also to realise that it has taken so very long for this human rights issue to be acknowledged by the D&aacute;il in a substantive manner.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I extend a very warm welcome to the women who are with us today in such significant numbers in the Gallery, with an overspill of numbers in the audiovisual room, and who have survived symphysiotomy, living with the legacy for many years.  We salute their courage in coming forward to tell their stories and to demand justice and truth.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhaibh uile anseo linn inniu agus t&aacute;im&iacute;d libh i gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa bhfeachtas chun an fh&iacute;rinne agus chun cothrom na f&eacute;inne a fh&aacute;il.</P>
      <Col N="653" />
      <P>The infliction of symphysiotomy on women in Ireland is one of the greatest medical scandals not only here but on an international scale.  Symphysiotomy is a clinical scandal on a par with the clerical scandals we have seen exposed in the past two decades.  It may not be on a par in terms of scale but it is certainly equivalent in terms of the suffering inflicted on the women victims and on their families and there is one very important and crucial parallel, that is the effort by the medical establishment and by previous Governments to conceal the true nature and extent of this abuse of the bodies and of the rights of Irish women.  I regret to say that this effort to conceal or deny the truth continues to be an objective of some.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution at the outset of these statements.  Promises of consultation with victims and their representatives are all very well.    However, after all these years, it is not enough.  It is not unreasonable that we would have expected more from the Minister this morning.  That said, hopefully, we will see an early breakthrough leading to a resolution of this long-standing issue and truth and justice for all the women concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that subject to legal advice, he will see the draft report referred to patient representative bodies and through them, the women who underwent symphysiotomy.  Surely that is something that could have been addressed before today and that we would know with certainty there would not be another obstacle.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he would then, following consideration of the final report, decide the next steps required.  Make no mistake about it, the next steps required have been articulated by the women here and the women who cannot be here today <i>ad infinitum</i>, year after year, going back many years.  The next steps are well and clearly documented.  All that we need is the political will to pursue them.  I urge the Minister to do exactly that.  He will have the 100% support of all elected voices in this Chamber and he will indeed have our commendation if he commits to doing that.</P>
      <P>Exactly one month ago on 15 February in the D&aacute;il, I questioned the Minister on symphysiotomy and asked him if he agreed that this barbaric act should never have been carried out in the first place.  We need to have a meeting of minds because the Minister replied: &ldquo;I reject the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that this was a barbaric act, although its use in certain circumstances may well transpire to have been utterly inappropriate.&rdquo;  That was a very regrettable statement on the Minister&rsquo;s part.  I have challenged him to ask any of the surviving victims if they agree with this contention that symphysiotomy was not barbaric.  A barbaric act is defined as something cruel and primitive.  Symphysiotomy was both cruel in its infliction and its effect and because it was medically unnecessary.  It was primitive because it arose out of an attempt to impose on the bodies of women an ultra-conservative version of Catholic teaching.</P>
      <P>Only yesterday the D&aacute;il passed the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill.  This legislation, which I wholly supported and endorsed, will outlaw another barbaric attack on the bodies of women arising out of a form of extremism which degrades women and girls and asserts male domination over them.  Symphysiotomy shows that such mentalities are not confined to Africa and this State is in no position to look down on countries where such practices are common while we deny the full truth of symphysiotomy and deny justice to its victims.</P>
      <P>In that exchange with me on 15 February, the Minister went on to state: &ldquo;It was a standard procedure at one time and it was reintroduced to certain Irish hospitals in the 1940s as a clinical response to the limitation imposed by specifically Catholic religious and ideological circumstances.&rdquo;  I contest that statement.  The evidence shows that even in more remote times, symphysiotomy was not a standard procedure.  It was always controversial from the time it was initiated in Paris in 1777.  It had been rejected in most countries at the time of its reintroduction in the Ireland of the 1940s.  This reintroduction was not, as the Minister stated, a clinical &ldquo;response&rdquo; to the limitation imposed by what he called &ldquo;Catholic religious and ideological circum<Col N="654" />stances&rdquo;.  Symphysiotomy was the imposition by clinicians in Irish hospitals of a certain Catholic ideology that saw the role of women solely as the bearers of Catholic children, a role to which their bodies and their rights were to be wholly subsumed.  It was also imposed for reasons of clinical training and we heard the testimony of women again last evening who suffered this procedure in the presence of large groups of medical students.</P>
      <P>The Minister in that exchange on 15 February unfortunately repeated the mantras we have heard from those in the medical establishment who seek to defend symphysiotomy, for example, that the safety of repeat caesarean sections in the period was unproven.  Remember we are talking here about the period from the 1940s to the 1980s.  It was as if medical science had not moved on in 40 years.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the Department of Health and Children in May 2001, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists claimed that the danger of sepsis from caesarean sections was the main reason for the carrying out of symphysiotomy.  Again, this was an attempt to muddy the waters.  Anyone who doubts the real motivation for the carrying out of symphysiotomy need only refer to the published writings of Dr. Arthur Barry and Dr. Alex Spain.  The former referred to caesarean section as leading to the &ldquo;improper prevention of pregnancy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Of course, the most compelling condemnation of symphysiotomy is not in academic studies but in the testimony of the victims themselves.  Not only was the operation cruel and unnecessary, its victims were kept in the dark about what was being done to them.  They received no aftercare or support.  That was the case for a significant number of women we have listened to.  They were effectively abandoned by the medical establishment and by the State.</P>
      <P>When the victims spoke out, it took a long time for them to be listened to.  Some of us in the Oireachtas, including my former D&aacute;il colleague, Arthur Morgan, as well as a number of Deputies from other parties and Independents, raised the issue with a succession of Ministers for Health.  The Minister was among those voices when in opposition.  We helped to keep the plight of the victims on the agenda but again it was the women themselves speaking out bravely who elevated the issue to national attention.</P>
      <P>In February 2010, RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; carried out an investigation into symphysiotomy.  I said at the time, when I secured a D&aacute;il Adjournment debate in the wake of the programme, that an inquiry into this practice should already have been held, reported and acted upon.</P>
      <P>One of the most extraordinary pieces of evidence on that programme was one that did not need a great deal of research.  It was on the number of symphysiotomies actually carried out.  The Department of Health and Children was asked for a figure &mdash; I had repeatedly sought this information &mdash; and it gave one which it said was incomplete because it did not have all the relevant health board reports.  However, a reporter from &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; was able to go to the National Library, which had the relevant reports, and find the correct figure.  It was three times the Department&rsquo;s estimate.  This was a very sorry and embarrassing state of affairs for the Department to find itself in.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, it was announced on behalf of the then Minister, Mary Harney, that she had asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prepare a report for her on the practice.  That was unacceptable.  She was asking the institution whose members were responsible for the abuse in the first place to investigate itself.  It was not a proper inquiry, although its establishment came about as a result of pressure on the Minister to act.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the report currently in the hands of the Minister was not the outcome of a transparent and public investigation.  We will reserve judgment until we see the contents of the Walsh report but whatever it concludes, the need for a proper inquiry remains.</P>
      <Col N="655" />
      <P>I thank the Oireachtas support group for victims of symphysiotomy, because it is only correct that I do so, and reaffirm that we will continue to work together on this issue.  I acknowledge the sincere intent and support of voices from all parties and Independents in this Chamber and on that basis, we intend to go forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue today.  I would first like to acknowledge the fantastic resilience and commitment of all those survivors, victims and campaigners who actively campaign for justice for the victims of this barbaric procedure.  As the Minister is aware, these groups consist of survivors of both symphysiotomy and pubiotomy.  They have been actively campaigning for an independent inquiry into these covert operations for the past ten years.  This State has failed these women.  The demands for a public inquiry, for full medical supports and for the right to pursue these cases through the courts must be facilitated.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to be one of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party representatives on the Oireachtas all-party support group.  Many of the victims of symphysiotomy are permanently disabled, incontinent and in pain.  I aim to highlight the anguish and unnecessary suffering these women endured.  I find it astonishing that no person or agency has ever been held accountable for these cruel and unnecessary procedures.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The admission by the Minister that symphysiotomy may occasionally have been wrongly performed did not go far enough.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in rebut any suggestion that symphysiotomy was generally an appropriate intervention.  It was never a standard operation in any country at any time and was a maverick practice that should never have been performed.  As studies have shown, both symphysiotomy and pubiotomy carry more risk than caesarean section.  This brutal surgery unhinged the pelvis and often led to long-term walking difficulties, bladder problems and chronic pain.  One of the starkest statistics shows that one baby in ten died when this practice was performed.  Ireland was the only country in the western world to practise these 18th-century operations in the mid to late 20th century.  The consequences for mothers of symphysiotomy were horrendous.  The long-term physical effects only tell half the story.  Many  mothers had great difficulty  bonding with their children and, as a mother of three, I find this one of the most heart-breaking consequences of this unnecessary procedure.  The brutality of the practice of symphysiotomy turned what should be the most memorable and joyous occasion of childbirth into a nightmare.</P>
      <P>These women were generally not informed in advance about their surgery.  Neither the risks nor the benefits had been explained to them nor had the existence of a safer alternative, caesarean section, been mentioned.  The failure of some hospital staff to inform women of their surgery was even more disturbing.  Even general practitioners refused, on occasion, to tell women what had been done to them.  Several decades had elapsed before many women finally understood that their pelvises had been broken.  It was as though these were secret operations, not to be disclosed to the patient.  The sinister role of the medical profession continues to this day as many patients have been unable to get access to their complete files.  Last night we heard from victims who could access all their records apart from those relating to the birth of their children.  It was as if it had never happened.  This is a disgraceful attempt to defend the medical profession from gross injustices perpetrated on patients.  It is something we have seen before and it is absolutely shameful.  A large percentage of women who underwent the procedure of symphysiotomy decided against having more children due to the emotional and physical attack they had undergone without their consent and because they feared this procedure would once again be forced upon them.</P>
      <P>We need to ensure that all the victims of symphysiotomy receive justice.  This draconian operation left women with horrific physical and mental effects.  As has been stated, many <Col N="656" />women still experience severe side effects due to the procedure of symphysiotomy and these severely impact on their quality of life.  The women who were subjected to this abusive surgery in childbirth have repeatedly reiterated their call for the statute that bars them from redress to be set aside.  As elected Members of Parliament, we have a duty to ensure that these women, whose constitutional and human rights were violated by these pelvis-breaking operations, finally receive justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people got in late on the act.  Like previous speakers, I acknowledge the visitors in the Gallery and pay tribute to the women who have courageously pursued this issue for many years.  It is a humbling experience for us to be present today.  I was sorry I could not stay for the full presentation last night but we had to speak in the Chamber.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Nobody could say they were glad to be present today for that is impossible, but it is a recognition of what went on.  It is an important acknowledgment by the State of the crimes committed against many of the women present today, crimes which led to the suffering endured by them and their families for decades.  It is important that the D&aacute;il acknowledges this.  It was the butchering of women&rsquo;s bodies, without their consent, for no medical reason.  It is truly horrific even to stand in this Chamber and talk about it.  Marie O&rsquo;Connor described it as a life sentence without remission.  The procedure was the severing of one of the main pelvic joints, the sundering of pubic bones and the unhinging of the pelvis.  It occurred before, during and after labour and women were expected to endure it.  It is horrendous that people were put through that.</P>
      <P>It is important that we acknowledge the wrong done to these women but that is not good enough.  People have endured this for decades.  They have put up with it and have campaigned for justice in its regard.  Today, we must do much more than acknowledge that a crime was committed, important though that may be.  People need answers about why this happened to them.  They need those responsible to be identified and called to account.  They need the State to acknowledge it failed in its duty of care to prevent this from happening.  Crucially, they need measures put in place so that all victims can get redress and have access to benefits and entitlements they should have as of right.  That is not happening.</P>
      <P>I noted the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the reports he commissioned.  I asked him about the matter before Christmas &mdash; it was delayed.  Today, the Minister told us he is awaiting further legal advice before he consults with the groups.  I must agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that this is a little disappointing.  The issue has been discussed in this House for more than ten years yet even today half-truths are being put about.  The first thing this debate must achieve is a full acknowledgment of what happened.  The Minister must stop peddling a certain half-truth, namely, that symphysiotomy was a normal procedure that happened at the time and that although what happened to the victims was shocking and terrible we have moved on from that now and things are better.  It was just a routine that happened in order to deal with difficult births.</P>
      <P>We must nail that lie.  That is not true.  Unless we address that issue we will not get any nearer to dealing with the issue.  Symphysiotomy was never medically necessary.  Information that verifies this is available from medical experience throughout Europe.  It was deemed to be <Col N="657" />too dangerous, a barbaric act, a mutilation.  The Minister stated it continued until the 1980s but there were cases even in the early 1990s.  This is part of our modern history and the women in the Gallery are living testament to it.  We have a chance now to do something about it.</P>
      <P>As historical records show, it was not a procedure used in emergencies but in many instances was a scheduled procedure by medical staff.  It was not the case that caesarean sections were not practised or were not safe during the 1940s and 1950s.  They were.  That is a false statement.  The reality of what happened was far worse than those half-truths which are being put out on the advice of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has a vested interest because its members were guilty of the acts in the first place.  The reality is this was a practice, found in Catholic hospitals in the main, which affected 1,500 women.  In essence, medical staff abused their position of medical power to carry out and deform women.  It was part of an ethos that sought to control the reproductive rights of women.  Women were seen as child-bearing vessels and because caesarean sections might limit the number of children they could have it was considered permissible to break their pelvis, in particular on the first child, and for young women, to enable them to have many children.  As we have heard, in many cases this took place without consent being sought.  People were sent home after major surgery and were not even told what had happened to them.</P>
      <P>What does this say about our attitude to women who were denied the basic right to control or have a say about surgery being carried out on their bodies?  A moral attitude was imposed on people by some medical practitioners in spite of best medical practice in place at the time.  That is a crime.  It is an abuse by those who were in position and people must be called to account for it.  There is documentary evidence which links this practice to an over-zealous Catholic ethos that was promulgated by the likes of Archbishop McQuaid in order to impose a certain moral viewpoint on society, the health and well-being of women notwithstanding.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Anything that prevented birth had to be opposed and the rights of women were secondary.  I find that abhorrent and it was a violation of human rights.  If we acknowledge that point, we must acknowledge that corrective action must take place.  Therefore, out of today&rsquo;s debate we need a number of corrective actions to be taken.  We need an absolute commitment to lifting the statute bar to allow women to seek redress for the crimes perpetrated against them.  It is urgent given the age profile of the women and their need to access it quickly.  That is not onerous; it is a reasonable demand proposed by symphysiotomy survivors.  The idea of an independent commission of inquiry is crucial.  There is too much reliance on the opinion of professional medical people to advise the Minister in this regard and we need to step back.  It is not good enough that these people investigate themselves.  It is inadequate that no person or agency has been held accountable for this.  It must stop if we are to move on.</P>
      
      <P>The special Survivors of Symphysiotomy medical card should be available to all but it is not.  Documented evidence available to the Minister and Members shows that many women have spent tens of thousands of euro trying to access medical assistance while they are receiving inadequate home help.  They should have these benefits as a right, including a doctor of their choice, home help and more liaison officers.  These important practical issues are the least these people deserve and while they do not undo the wrong they make the lives of these women easier.  We have a chance to play our part, to reward the efforts of these women who have campaigned for justice over the decades.  We can say that this crime ended today and that justice and redress began.  We can be a part of changing modern Irish history, where we put it behind us on the correct basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">In one and a half years in the previous D&aacute;il and one year to date in this D&aacute;il, I have come across a number of forgotten groups in society.  These include <Col N="658" />the post-polio survivors, survivors of thalidomide and women who lived &mdash; or, rather, existed &mdash; in the Magdalene laundries.  This is another group that has been forgotten by society.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in bringing this matter to the Chamber, where it deserves to be, and in setting up the all-party group on the topic.</P>
      <P>The facts of the procedure are chilling and disturbing.  These include unhinging the pelvis, severing joints and sundering pubic bones.  I acknowledge that 180 women still survive.  Some of them have ended up permanently disabled, incontinent and in pain.  Some faced the anguish of losing their babies doing the procedure.  It is a very sad issue.  In talking about it, can we do justice to the stories in the way these women can?  Some of the women were unaware of what they were going through, which is frightening, because it was not spoken of until recently.  I acknowledge the work of Marie O&rsquo;Connor and her book, <i>Bodily Harm: Symphysiotomy and Pubiotomy in Ireland 1944-92</i>.  She pays tribute to the women and speaks of their courage, tenacity, determination and indomitable spirit.  It must be difficult for them to sit here and go through it all again.</P>
      <P>The procedure was described as widening the pelvis but it really severed the pelvis.  It was carried out by doctors at the same time as they were withholding the procedure of caesarean section.  It was dangerous for mothers and babies and some procedures were performed in the aftermath of the caesarean while others were performed during labour.  It is too cruel to think about it.  Women in labour for many hours could have had the operation forced upon them without warning in the labour ward or in theatre and sometimes without anaesthetic.  One can imagine the pain of women trying to give birth with an unhinged pelvis and then discharged with a broken pelvis with no medical treatment and no painkillers.  The idea of patient consent or discussion with the patient of the implications and consequences of the procedure was a non-event.  Options were not discussed and a lot of time elapsed before the women understood what had happened.  It belongs to a time when women, their dignity and their rights were a non-event.  We have seen examples of the failure of care during surgery and afterwards when people with walking disabilities were in chronic pain.  The disability benefits were inadequate, as was access to services.  These women suffered and their health was affected and they deserve to be looked after by the State.  I note that the Minister mentioned the range of services but these are not getting through to all of the women.  Like many of the ladies in the Magdalene laundries, their advancing age is a factor and they should have justice before their time is over.  Caesarean section was a safer alternative yet dangerous operations such as symphysiotomy and pubiotomy were continued.  This must be seen as an example of medical negligence and breaches of the constitutional rights of women, their right to dignity, the right to make decisions about their own bodies and the right to medical care and treatment.  It was a violation of human rights and is linked to a male-dominated medical profession, the male-dominated Catholic Church and decisions made about women to which they were not party.  Many of our institutions were involved in that.  One lady called it a daily crucifixion.</P>
      <P>I support the calls made and the questions that must be answered.  We must acknowledge the physical and psychological disabilities.  The questions include why there are no medical records, why they are not receiving the care they need, why medical staff did not give them information about the procedure prior to it and why women were discharged with pelvic injuries without providing adequate care.  There is no doubt it is barbaric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickWallace">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have anything new to add to what has been said.  It is very hard to talk about this.  It is so horrific.  It is clearly another example of men trying to control women&rsquo;s bodies.  We have a male-dominated Parliament doing little about this, just as it failed <Col N="659" />to legislate for the 1992 Supreme Court judgment in the X case, which ruled that abortion is legal in Ireland where a woman&rsquo;s life is at risk, including through the threat of suicide.  This is a moral attitude driven by a warped religious thinking and has led to bad things happening to good people.</P>
      <P>We need a temporary lifting of the statute bar to enable women to seek redress through the courts.  Justice demands that the statute of limitations be set aside for at least one year.  We need to set up an independent commission of inquiry that is not controlled by vested interests and the access to the health benefits and entitlements promised by the Government in 2003, many of which were subsequently withdrawn or never granted, to be placed on a statutory basis.  Fairness is all people ask and accountability, transparency and acknowledgement would go a long way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HeatherHumphreys">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Heather Humphreys</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputy Regina Doherty.  I welcome the survivors of symphysiotomy present in the Gallery to witness an historic and momentous occasion.  Today represents an emotional occasion for them, their families and their friends.  The women had to endure tremendous suffering for over 40 or 50 years in many cases due to the practice of symphysiotomy.  It is of great significance that this is being debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Symphysiotomy was carried out on more than 1,500 women in Ireland between 1944 and 1992.  It is said that it was used in exceptional circumstances and its use declined from the mid-1960s on, except in the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, where it remained in practice until 1984.</P>
      <P>It is extremely disturbing to know that at a time when symphysiotomy was not being used elsewhere, it was still in practice in Ireland until 30 years ago.  Serious questions must be answered in that regard and it is my hope that the draft report currently before the Attorney General will start the process of answering some of those questions.</P>
      <P>I met with a number of members of the Survivors of Symphysiotomy last night, as did other Oireachtas Members, and one can only sympathise with the huge trauma they have experienced.  This procedure, carried out in many cases without the permission of the patient, has left many women with permanent issues relating to mobility, incontinence, pain and depression.  I read one extract in which a woman stated that after a symphysiotomy she had to be taught how to walk again.  That is an example of the ordeal some of these women faced.</P>
      <P>I listened last night, as did others, to horrific personal accounts of the way women were treated during childbirth and when I heard that women were shown a saw before it was used on them, I was horrified.  I want to commend the women who came forward and told their stories last night because each time they tell them, they relive again the horror of what they went through.  It was an awful experience for them.</P>
      <P>I am a mother of two children who were both born by caesarean section and when I heard the stories last night of the way women were restrained, their arms pulled back and held down for the procedure to take place, I felt physically sick and ashamed that women could be treated in such a barbaric way in this country.  The stories we heard were like something we would have heard happen in a remote part of the Third World in an almost ritualistic way.</P>
      <P>Having a child should be a joyous occasion for any family but the sad reality is that this procedure has left women mutilated for life, to the extent that it has impacted on the quality and enjoyment of their lives.  It has affected women from across the country, including in my own constituency.  There was a telephone call to my office yesterday evening from a lady who had a symphysiotomy carried out in Drogheda.  I understand she is unable to be present here today but she informed my office that she would be watching proceedings closely at home.</P>
      <Col N="660" />
      <P>It is an important point, and other Deputies have alluded to it, that for the vast majority of women this procedure was carried out over 40 years ago.  Some of them are now in old age and have been campaigning for justice all their lives.  I hope that fact will be taken into consideration to ensure this matter is progressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, we are living in extremely difficult financial times and I am fully aware that the Government&rsquo;s strong focus is on improving our economic position.  However, it is critically important that sensitive issues such as the one before us today are given the due consideration they deserve and not simply brushed aside, as has been the case in the past.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which has cross-party support.  I commend my constituency colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who convened the all-party Oireachtas group and who I know has put a great deal of work into this issue.  I pay tribute also to Marie O&rsquo;Connor and to the groups that have provided many of the women with somewhere to turn to and ensured their voices are heard.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my support for this issue.  I want to impress upon the Minister to fully investigate it and to consider temporarily lifting the statute bar to enable women seek redress through the courts.  Women have been treated with appalling disrespect.  What they experienced was a form of institutional abuse.  There must be an independent inquiry into this matter to ensure the pain and torture these victims of symphysiotomy endured can be publicly recognised, which would give them closure on the matter.  I again impress upon the Minister that every effort should be made to ensure that finality is brought to this matter as soon as possible and that the women affected are given satisfactory closure also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ReginaDoherty">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Regina Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter but I do so with a genuinely heavy heart.  I welcome all of the ladies and their families to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but I wish their visit was under different circumstances.</P>
      <P>Nothing in the year I have been a Member of this House has affected me as much as this matter.  I have huge respect for the courage and bravery shown by the women we have had the privilege to meet in recent months but when we consider the suffering, pain and trauma they have been put through for practically their entire adult life and the effects of that trauma on their husbands, children and, in some cases their grandchildren, I am devastated by it.  I cannot even begin to imagine the pain and suffering each of those ladies have gone through in the past 40 or 50 years.</P>
      <P>I have a long speech but I will not read it out.  I just want to say that for the vast majority of their lives these women have been hiding their hearts from the people who love them the most.  The vast majority of the people in this country do not know what a symphysiotomy is, let alone what any of these women have experienced.  The commitment we can give is to ensure that the respect and the redress they are entitled to will be their reward.  They deserve to be given their lives back but that is not within our gift.  I urge the Minister to give these ladies the justice they so richly deserve and to do so as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am happy to be participating in this debate but I value the opportunity to contribute on a matter that should have been dealt with many years ago.  Like other speakers, I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of the women and their families who have been affected by this travesty that has been needlessly visited on them.</P>
      <P>My first exposure to this issue was in 2009 when, as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, we heard a presentation in which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was involved, as was the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I welcome the fact that the Minister remained in <Col N="661" />the Chamber for this important debate.  In that presentation we heard reports from women that were harrowing.  As a man, the thought of my mother, my sisters or my daughter experiencing the appalling, barbaric brutality these mothers experienced filled me with horror.  What struck me most forcefully, however, was the dignity of the women and their families and their determination to work towards a solution to this problem in so far as any solution can be reached.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge also that at that period the then Deputy Kathleen Lynch was very much to the fore in promoting awareness of this issue.  I am conscious that as she is now a Minister of State in the Department of Health with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, who has an appreciation of the problems, we can all have a realistic expectation that this matter will be prioritised and action taken on it.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, on his recent initiative in bringing together the all-party group.  As he stated last evening in the AV room, the idea of us acting in a collegiate way can do a great deal to resolve issues.  I am minded of the Deputy&rsquo;s former constituency colleague, Dr. Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, who had major experience in this area, both as a practitioner and as Minister for Health.  He often stated in this House, and to me, that adversarial politics is very bad for public health.  If we could have a more collegiate and collaborative approach to many of the issues on the health agenda we could work towards a solution for many of them in a more efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, I have no more than a layman&rsquo;s understanding of symphysiotomy.  I accept it is a legitimate medical procedure but one that can be used in exceedingly rare medical circumstances.  I understand for medical practitioners that in those exceedingly rare circumstances it has, on occasions, saved the lives of children and mothers.  The problem we face is that in this country, most notably in three maternity hospitals, namely Holles Street, the Coombe and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, it was not used in very rare occasions, rather it was used with considerable frequency.</P>
      <P>The Minister said symphysiotomy is not a barbaric act.  In strict terms, he is correct.  Amputation is not a barbaric act but the amputation of a healthy limb by a medical professional would be a barbaric act.  What was perpetrated on these women needlessly, unnecessarily and with their knowledge was barbarism by medical professionals.  It shocks us to the core to think it could have happened.</P>
      <P>We commend the Minister for bringing in Dr. Oonagh Walsh and conducting a study.  He indicated there are some legal difficulties in publishing it.  We urge him to publish it as quickly as possible and ask the Attorney General to get on with the job of perusing it.  We need another debate in the House immediately following its publication.  It may well be that the solutions to the problem and the next steps are contained in the report.  If they are, we will come together on an all-party basis and support the Minister in implementing them.  If the report does not recommend the necessary actions, we will have to consider that.</P>
      <P>Some reference has been made to the Catholic church and its possible influence on what happened.  Any Catholic zealot who pursued these practices was no servant of the church and was not acting in a Christian manner.  He or she should consider his or her position in terms of his or her view of Christianity and the church.  The basic tenant is &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Given that the church has been brought into the debate, we should also consider whether the procedure was a feature of the medical arrogance and godlike authority that was given to people in the senior echelons of the Irish medical profession.  The attitude was doctor knows, <Col N="662" />doctor says, doctor is always right and doctor cannot be challenged.  One would hope we have moved a long way from that situation.</P>
      <P>We have to openly and unambiguously say to the women that they were brutalised by the State and the State apologises unambiguously to them.  In 2003 SOS met the then Minister Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  Attempts were made in the aftermath of that meeting to provide a comprehensive suite of medical supports for the women affected.</P>
      <P>A very good job appears to have been done in the north east.  I have heard many positive comments about Ms Joanne White, the liaison officer in the area, and the manner in which she assists women to gain access to treatment, even alternative treatments which have been chosen by many women.  Liaison officers should be available across the country, similar to the service available in the north east.  Medical cards and access to all the necessary clinicians, clinical support, aids and equipment should be made available.</P>
      <P>The issue of compensation inevitably arises in case like this.  I live in a constituency where Army deafness claims were a major issue.  I know many people who took games against the State arising out of its negligence and that of the military authorities in providing them with the safeguards they needed in order to not damage their hearing by gunfire.  I compare what happened to those men and women with the invasive and brutal experiences of the women who underwent symphysiotomy.  The problem arose not from negligence but was deliberately perpetrated upon them.</P>
      <P>When one compares the two situations, one has to say the State has to offer a compensation package to the dwindling group of women who now need compensation to live out their lives in comfort.  I understand &euro;321 million was spent on the Irish Army deafness cases.  A tiny fraction of that figure is required to address, in some small way, the suffering these ladies continue to experience on a daily basis.  The Army deafness cases were obvious.  The suffering of these women is somewhat invisible and not known to the public.  It is to be hoped that after today&rsquo;s debate it will be known and understood.</P>
      <P>This debate should be one of the final steps towards finding a solution to this challenge.  I have confidence in the Minister.  He has been fairly clear in his understanding of the issue, although we might disagree on some of the details.  He knows the suffering people have endured.  It rests with him and I am sure he will be encouraged by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to move the situation towards the sort of resolution we need.  I urge him to do that as soon as possible and ensure we can have, at the earliest possible date, a follow-up debate in the House on the issue in order that the matter does not rest until the measures that meet the needs, demands and rights of the people affected are put in place.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I raised it a number of times when I was a Member of the other House. </P>
      <P>As a society, in the past number of years we have lifted many flat stones, shone light into several dark corners and looked in horror at the scandals that lived beneath our notice.  Just as no person can be completely sane without coming to terms with  past traumas, no society can be healthy that is afraid to look at and heal its past.</P>
      <Col N="663" />
      <P>Lifting stones and seeing horrors serves us by comforting the victims, punishing the perpetrators and preventing future disasters.  All of us here are aware of the symphysiotomies that were performed in Irish hospitals from 1944-83.  The previous Minister for Health announced a partial inquiry into one hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda.  I ask the current Minister for an inquiry into the practice in all hospitals.</P>
      <P>This operation was simply the cutting in two of the cartilage that holds the hips together in front to widen the passage during childbirth.  That description makes the process sound clinical, normal and even medical.  The surviving women want answers, and I want them too.  While the operation was simple in surgical terms, the reasons for its use in place of caesarean sections, the after-effects of the women involved and the role of a perversion of religious doctrine are far more complex.</P>
      <P>Symphysiotomy was first advocated in 1597 by a French carpenter and became a rare and odd operation until better hygiene, anaesthesia and clinical practice made caesarean sections safer.  In the developed world the operation fell completely out of use.  Why was it reintroduced to Ireland in 1944?  Why did Irish obstetric practice diverge from Britain and the rest of Europe in 1944?  For what reason were Irish women condemned to endure a procedure that was genital mutilation and banished from the developed world?  Symphysiotomy was described in 1951 by the then Nuffield Professor of Obstetrics, the finest obstetrics surgeon of his time, as medicine from the Dark Ages.  He described it thus for good reasons.  One clear and single reason led to caesarean section supplanting symphysiotomy when medical practice made caesarean sections safe.  Symphisiotomies damage babies in childbirth.  There is a 10% mortality rate, making symphysiotomy a high-risk procedure, even in skilled hands, for both the infant and mother.  How many children were affected in terms of health and how many lost their lives because of the operations carried out in Ireland between 1944 and 1983?</P>
      <P>Why did so many women who had symphisiotomies tell us of incontinence, walking problems and terrible chronic pain?  Could there be a connection between the horrendous consequences for women and the after care they received?  Women tell us of having been taken from their beds and made to walk within hours, despite textbooks requiring five to seven days of bed rest.</P>
      <P>Serious questions must be asked about the manner in which the operation was performed and the after care women received.  &ldquo;Savage cruelty&rdquo; is a mild term for the way in which the affected women were treated.  Worse, it seems this savagery was visited on the most vulnerable.  Women who were detained, often illegally, in the so-called Magdalene homes, including single mothers and the poor, may have been doubly victimised through being subjected to bush-clinic obstetrics in a modern country.</P>
      <P>I am a practising Catholic but believe the use of the procedure to avoid family planning sought by women was a disgusting perversion of Catholicism.  However, this may have been a motivation for inflicting the procedure on women.  We need to know whether this was the case.</P>
      <P>We know from recent times that tribunals can be lengthy and costly.  An inquiry into symphysiotomy can be done simply and cost effectively.  A legal and medical expert should be employed to conduct such an inquiry.</P>
      <P>For women trapped in incontinence, immobility and constant pain, symphisiotomies are not history.  What do numbers matter when one baby killed leads to a lifetime of grief and sorrow, inflicted for no reason?  Now is the time to give answers to those alive to hear them.  A relatively cheap, simple inquiry would provide such answers and would be some recognition of the misery misguided medicine has inflicted.  It would go some way towards giving closure on foot of the pain of the affected women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a quite technical speech written but will leave it alone.  I will keep my head down because I feel so ashamed about the way the women in question have been treated.  I ask the gentlemen in the Chamber to excuse me when I say I feel so strongly about this subject as a woman.  Symphysiotomy was still carried out in 1984, only a year after I had a baby.  To think I could have been subjected to the barbaric practice, with some sort of religious overtones or undertones, is frightening.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that it was believed the procedure was good at the time.  However, one should consider the after care the women received.  The procedure was carried out by intelligent people.  My Government colleague has likened it to female genital mutilation.  I would liken it to it also.  Female genital mutilation, as with symphysiotomy, is a fundamental violation of women&rsquo;s human rights.  Their civil liberties are being defiled, predominantly those associated with health, freedom of choice and the right not to be degraded.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A primary reason for the performance of female genital mutilation and symphysiotomy is related to sexual, health and religious concerns.  Female genital mutilation is performed in Third World countries but we, who believe we are so modern, should realise symphysiotomy is very similar and was performed in Ireland until 1984, which I consider to be very much in the recent past.  Doctors chose to perform the procedure instead of caesarean sections.</P>
      <P>Caesarean sections date from long before Julius Caesar, after whom the procedure is named.  I have no idea, therefore, why symphysiotomy was reintroduced in 1944.  The medical profession should have known about its dangers.  Had practitioners opened their eyes, they would have seen the difficulties experienced by women who had the procedure.  It is heinous.</P>
      <P>I, too, would like all the answers.  I urge the Minister to bring about closure regarding the horrendous practice and the way in which affected women have been left to one side.  The Government is committed to achieving closure for the victims of symphysiotomy.</P>
      <P>I heard harrowing stories last night, one of which was about a woman who had the operation performed on her when she was only 33.  The procedure took away her mental health, her relationship with her husband and the relationship she should have had with her children.  I feel really ashamed that symphysiotomy was carried out in what was deemed a modern country.  I urge the Minister to do whatever must be done to bring about closure on this awful episode.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.</P>
      <P>I never heard of symphysiotomy or pubiotomy until a year ago.  It was brought to my attention by two very brave women, Ms Olivia Kearney and Ms Catherine Naughton, women of great grace and courage.  Since then, I have met many other victims and survivors, and the advocacy groups.  I commend them all.  I commend an Teachta &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on his leadership on this issue.</P>
      <P>Symphysiotomy and pubiotomy amount to institutional abuse.  Symphysiotomy involves acts of butchery against female citizens  The State should be deeply ashamed about what it allowed to happen to them because of the influence of conservative religious fundamentalism.</P>
      <P>Last night, a group of survivors, including Matilda Behan, Ellen Moore, Helen Kennealy and Anne Ward, who spoke on behalf of her mother Mary MacDonogh, gave testimony to the hurt and trauma they suffered.  As colleagues have said, the accounts were deeply distressing and upsetting for those who gave them and for us who listened in silence.  The 200 or so survivors of symphysiotomy are mainly elderly and some are becoming quite frail.  They carry the deep physical and emotional scars.</P>
      <Col N="665" />
      <P>A woman called Lilly McDonnell called to see me in Drogheda.  She was a victim 60 years ago and told me how her child was killed in the course of this procedure and of the physical damage done to her.  She showed me the child&rsquo;s birth certificate.  Like the other survivor, Lilly lives daily with the harrowing consequences of what was done to her six decades ago.</P>
      <P>I do not want to give a history of the practice or of the use of misinformation to deny the victims justice and truth, or of the destruction of records, the shameful use of many of the women as teaching aids in hospitals without their consent, and the denial of proper after care.  These details have already been outlined graphically.  Our focus as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la must be to ensure this deep wrong is finally brought to a conclusion in a way that is acceptable to the victims.  In a real republic the rights of these citizens would have been protected and the survivors of symphysiotomy would have had justice many years ago.  They have campaigned for truth.  They have asked one Minister for Health after another to provide the truth through the establishment of a full public inquiry.</P>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s statement today, however, even though he was moved by the case of the witness brought here by other colleagues.  There is all-party support for these women.  In opposition, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, gave his full support to the demand for a public inquiry at an Oireachtas committee hearing in 2009.  Now he has the responsibility and the power to finally make it happen.  He can say he will authorise a full public inquiry into these events.  Nothing else will suffice.  Nothing else will do.</P>
      <P>I know from my experience in a different area that unless the victims are given satisfaction, the campaigning, but more importantly, the hurt, the anguish, the grief and the bereavement will go on.  Given the increasing age of the victims, the chronic pain and constant medical intervention they require, it is urgent the Minister deals with this by giving them support now.  I appeal to the Minister to assure victims today that he will hold an inquiry as they have requested.  I also appeal to him to ask the Government to agree to the lifting of the statute bar to allow victims to seek redress through the courts.</P>
      <P>There are several justice campaigns which can be resolved in this D&aacute;il term.  They include Justice for the Maggies, for other victims of institutionalised abuse, including Bethany Home and at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and victims of symphysiotomy.  These causes are crying out for justice.  We can do something about it.  These women as citizens deserve our support, our love and they particularly deserve to have their wrong righted.  We as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la have a duty to make this happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">All Members who have listened to this debate on symphysiotomy, and the excessive pain suffered by women as a result, have described it as a barbaric procedure.  Many of us who met the women who underwent this procedure have learned how their lives were affected and shaped subsequently.  Listening to their stories, many of us have been shocked.  There have been very few occasions when I have attended presentations in the Leinster House audio-visual room where noticeably people in the audience were moved to tears by what they had heard.  I commend the individuals who have fought this campaign through thick and thin.  It is not easy for people to discuss their personal lives and what was done to them in such a manner.  It takes great courage to do so and I commend the individuals involved.</P>
      <P>What sets aside symphysiotomy from other invasive medical procedures is not just its brutal nature but that it is completely avoidable.  Alternative treatments could and should have been used.  There was no justification for the procedure then and neither is there any justification for the perpetuation of the injustice experienced by these women now.  This procedure was performed on approximately 1,500 women, many from my constituency who attended the Our <Col N="666" />Lady of Lourdes Hospital, a hospital that continued with this procedure up to modern times long after all others had ceased.  This again raises an issue about the clinical governance at this hospital through this period.</P>
      <P>These operations were undertaken because of a narrow interpretation of a religious ideology and no consideration was given to the views of the mothers.  No alternatives were offered or explanations given of the long-term effect of the procedure.  Nowhere was the informed consent of the women who underwent this procedure sought.  These women entered the care of the State as expectant mothers and left as injured victims.</P>
      <P>While for many these events are historical, the outcomes are very much sadly in the present.  We still have very brave women who carry the scars of this procedure and have been forced to campaign for justice.  No one in this Administration is going as far as they should to hold the individuals to account for what happened to these women.  It is true the damage cannot be undone.  However, these women are entitled to justice.  It is in the Government&rsquo;s gift to recognise that what happened in the past in the name of the State was wrong.</P>
      <P>It is also in the gift of the Government to extend the Statute of Limitations to allow these cases to be dealt with and to make public the report on this situation.  As the Opposition, it is our job to hold the Government to account.  While we may have a different vision, political philosophy and policies to those of the Government, I believe there is a common decency that we all share.  It underlines a common morality of what is right and wrong.  The Government knows what needs to be done for these women.</P>
      <P>In the past they were victims because a system prioritised other considerations above their rights as citizens and mothers.  Let us not repeat that mistake.  Let us not put legal or financial considerations before ending this injustice.  We must finally do the right thing by these women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldNash">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, unfortunately, has seen many abuse scandals but the tale of abuse suffered by the victims of symphysiotomy is a particularly squalid and vicious stain on our national history.  I do not use the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; carelessly for I believe what was done to the women in question, as other Members have stated, was a form of institutionalised abuse.  Ireland has failed these women.  We failed them when we first inflicted this barbaric procedure on them, long after it had been discontinued in other developed countries.  We failed them in 2003 when the then Minister for Health and Children refused to hold an inquiry.  We failed them again in 2010 when the then Minister, Mary Harney, again refused an inquiry.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has commissioned an independent review of the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland due to be published soon.</P>
      <P>The story does not stop there, however.  We must be sure not to fail these women again.  Some of the language and phrases emanating from professional medical institutions and State officials in the lead-up to the publication of this report has been concerning.  Phrases such as &ldquo;standard procedure for the time&rdquo; and &ldquo;emergency surgery only&rdquo; have been wafted into the air to serve as a smokescreen to cover up some of the deliberate and planned actions in the use of this horrendous procedure which had lost credibility a long time ago.  This was not a standard procedure in developed countries.  To call it such adds further insult to the injuries suffered by the women in question, many of whom are from my area Louth and Meath.</P>
      <P>The procedure was resurrected in Ireland, I believe, to facilitate a perverse and twisted interpretation of religious doctrine whereby women should continue to have children regardless of the impact on their health.  Symphysiotomy was rejected by British doctors in 1855 while the <Col N="667" />French Society of Medicine rejected it as far back as 1798 at a time when the French were guillotining people by the thousands.</P>
      <P>Last night some survivors of symphysiotomy came to Leinster House to tell their own stories.  One woman spoke of how she was held down by nurses, her arms forced back, while a doctor sawed through her pubis in front of a theatre packed with students.  She screamed at him to stop an operation for which her consent had neither been sought nor given.  She said it was like she was forced to endure an aggravated sexual assault.  This is a woman, a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, who is now in her 80s but still cannot sleep at night.  She has been incontinent most of her adult life and has suffered a succession of health problems as a result of the injuries inflicted upon her.  She was a young woman then when this horror was inflicted on her and occurred at a time when the world was still reeling at the atrocities carried out by the Nazis including their gruesome medical experiments that we know about now.  As a young woman, she wondered how something such as that could have happened to her in her own country.  An older woman now, she is yet to receive a comprehensive answer.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Cloyne report last year, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste rightly condemned the culture of secrecy, evasion and deceit that had characterised the response of the Catholic Church to the issue of child abuse.  We cannot allow a similar culture to fester in the corridors of Departments and professional bodies.  There are already far too many disturbing stories of women being denied access to their medical records or of their records being conveniently lost.  Last night, a woman spoke of how the hospital in which she had given birth to her five children had no record of them.  According to the hospital, they did not exist.  Elements of official Ireland are seeking to air-brush history.  We must have the truth and there must be a day of reckoning.</P>
      <P>What practical measures can the House take and what can we, as public representatives, do?  Deputies from all parties can begin today by giving the victims a voice, but we must ensure that voice is heard to good effect.  There can be no further cover-ups or evasions.  There must be access to some form of legitimate redress.  A day rarely passes when I knowingly or otherwise do not encounter a friend, family friend, neighbour or member of the community in which I was born and reared who has not been directly affected by the impact of this barbaric procedure.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the continuation of this process of redress, we should do as the Deputies opposite suggested and give consideration to a Bill to suspend the Statute of Limitations temporarily.  There is a precedent, although the House does not need to be reminded of it.  Only approximately 150 victims of symphysiotomy are with us.  Many have passed on.  We have failed these people too often and must not fail them again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneFerris">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Anne Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>For several decades, the practice of symphysiotomy has had a devastating effect on women.  Barbaric acts were inflicted unnecessarily on women who were in their most vulnerable state.  At a time when joy for a newborn was to be expected, women were subjected to a procedure that would alter the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>The procedure was carried out on up to 1,500 women and resulted in a wide range of short and long-term complications, including walking difficulties, haematoma, incontinence, infections and pelvic joint pain among others.  I remember well the indignity of having to be shaved, being given an enema and having an episiotomy, all to spare the blushes of the male doctors.  Little did I realise at the time that the situation was worse for many women.</P>
      <P>Watching the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this matter a short time ago brought home to me the effects of this procedure. The acts were not consented to and amounted to institutional abuse.  There is no retrospective justification for them.  This 18th century practice was alive and <Col N="668" />well in the 20th century when other countries were phasing it out.  The technique does not form any part of the Irish curriculum of specialist training and is apparently only taught as an emergency procedure.  If this is the case, why was this practice being utilised by doctors in this country?  Why was it that, in some cases, the procedure was carried out after the baby had been safely delivered, let alone before or during birth?  Why on Earth were doctors with saws allowed to perform pubiotomys?</P>
      <P Just="Left">Survivors of Symphysiotomy, SOS, is a group that was formed to answer questions such as these.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the many women in the Visitors Gallery, in particular a good friend of mine from County Wicklow, Marie and her husband, Billy, who have unsuccessfully lobbied previous Ministers to seek justice on this issue.  The women in the Visitors Gallery represent only a fraction of those affected by the practice.  Many women have passed away and others are unable to make it here today for health reasons.</P>
      <P>I understand that the SOS group is seeking resolutions on a number of matters, including the lifting of the statute bar to enable women to seek redress through the courts, the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry, and access to promised health benefits and entitlements to be enshrined in statute.  The Minister for Health has received a draft report on the practice of symphysiotomy from an independent academic researcher.  I understand that this report has been sent to the Attorney General for her consideration and, subject to her views, will be made available for consultation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is important that, in the intervening period and until decisions on what will be done are taken, women have easy access to support services provided by the HSE.  This has not been the case to date and some individuals have not even been able to access their own medical records.  I urge SOS to press on and to keep up the pressure on politicians to act.  Groups such as SOS are fundamentally important in bringing to light the dark side of a society that liked to hide in the shadows.  The barbaric acts of the past are brought to the fore when a few people who are committed to seeing justice done come together.  This is why the work of a coalition such as SOS should not be underestimated.  I am reminded of a saying, &ldquo;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <P>I am heartened by the cross-party support on this issue.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for convening the meetings and getting everything going.  He is to be congratulated.  I hope that the justice sought by SOS can be realised and that it will go some way towards addressing the grave wrongs that have been done.  In the meantime, we all hold our heads in shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the women to the Visitors Gallery.  If anything has united them other than the symphysiotomy procedures performed on them, it has been the powerlessness.  Today&rsquo;s debate contributes to some of their power being returned to them and acknowledges that the issue is an important step.  However, it is only a step, as we would all agree.</P>
      <P>The debate forces those of us contributing to it to carry out research.  All of today&rsquo;s contributions have been important.  I was not able to attend last night&rsquo;s briefing, but I spoke with colleagues who were there.  They were deeply affected by it.  Communication is viewed as being primarily about speech, but listening to people is just as important and was the most powerful element of last night&rsquo;s briefing.  It was important that Members listened to the women&rsquo;s voices.  Some people believe that politicians are less than human.  In fact we are very much affected by the types of issue that impact on people, including this one.</P>
      <Col N="669" />
      <P>I have some knowledge of this issue because my mother had a symphysiotomy in 1952 in Holles Street hospital.  She is in her 90th year and still talks about it.  In many cases, the practice was intended to ensure that a woman would not have a  section.  The idea was that a  section would limit one&rsquo;s ability to have a raft of children.  It worked in my mother&rsquo;s case.  By 1956, she had five children and more were to follow.  The idea was to deliver a large number of children into a Catholic country.</P>
      <P>The question of clusters is interesting.  This point has already been made.  Symphysiotomy procedures primarily occurred in hospitals with a Catholic ethos.  The evidence from other European countries shows that this was not a dominant practice there.  One must question the medical aspects to which the Minister referred.  If the upcoming report is to be a proper one, we must also question the ethos.  This is what has resulted in women&rsquo;s powerlessness for years.</P>
      <P>One of the first tasks for most expectant mothers &mdash; I have two children &mdash; is choosing their hospital.  They want to be able to trust the hospital and its professionals to take care of them.  A large number of women believe their trust was abused.  In the Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s, the church, State and professions thought they knew best.  It was not the thing to do for a mere woman to question a consultant.</P>
      <P>In most cases this procedure was carried out on women expecting their first babies.  Not only were these women less knowledgeable about child birth, but the procedure also made the birth a more traumatic experience because it lengthened the period of labour.  In most instances the procedure was carried out during labour.  If it was done for purely medical reasons, such as to reduce the mortality rate among women and babies, it would have been accepted to some extent.  However, the practice was primarily clustered around hospitals with a Roman Catholic ethos and this was central to its use.  Deputy John Paul Phelan asked why the procedure began to be carried out in 1944.  I have been asking myself the same question but one only needs to look at the religious control exerted during the 1940s and 1950s for the answer.  While I am not religious, I defend the personal right to practise religion.  However, it is wrong to allow religion to control society.  Large families were the norm in Ireland and as late as the 1970s mothers were questioned if they only had two or three children.  Family planning clinics could not charge for artificial birth control in the 1970s.  They had to ask for prescriptions because it was illegal to sell contraceptive drugs without them.</P>
      <P>Our society was changed by the courage of those who challenged the system.  The women who took the train to Belfast and came back with contraceptives were openly defying the State.  Similar courage has been displayed by the residents of the Magdalene homes and the victims of industrial abuse.  This society has been challenged by their personal stories.</P>
      <P>I almost feel sorry for the Minister because I am aware he has to be balanced in his remarks.  He adopted a different attitude when he was in opposition, however.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, advocated the establishment of an inquiry into this issue.  Any report that solely considers clinical issues without addressing the social context will be unable to provide the answers people want.  I am concerned by the Minister&rsquo;s comment that the researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information.  It has been noted by other speakers that some of the medical records no longer exist.  It is, therefore, difficult to quantify the numbers involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby.  I hope that continues to be the case but it is important that we examine these practices because we will have to contend with a reduction in the number of professionals working in the health <Col N="670" />service.  It is questionable whether there will be adequate staffing to ensure that we continue to be one of the safest places in the world.</P>
      <P>It is essential that an independent inquiry be established.  The women concerned must be able to get answers as well as the medical treatment they require.  Teaching practices at the hospital must be examined because if they have been exported to other, less developed countries I would feel responsible for the impact on women in those countries.</P>
      <P>I thank those who kept the matter on the agenda, including Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for convening the group.  It is important that we come to a satisfactory conclusion.  We will not be able turn the clock back but the least we can do is ensure that people&rsquo;s questions are answered and their health care needs are addressed.  Given the small number of people involved, extending the Statute of Limitations would allow the State to acknowledge a wrong that should be addressed even if it cannot be put right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew nothing about symphysiotomy and pubiotomy until the constituent to which Deputy Anne Ferris referred invited me to a meeting.  I listened in horror to the stories being told.  Coming from a farming background, I have cared for hundreds, if not thousands, of animals while they gave birth and I would call a vet if I needed help.  A vet would be more considerate than some of these people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As I was tied up in committee meetings, I did not get the opportunity to hear the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I do not want to read a copy of it because I urge everyone concerned to set aside the protective mode and acknowledge the wrong that was visited on these ladies.  They were abused for experimental or religious reasons, or simply because of an attitude of medical superiority.  Some of those who spoke last night argued that it is too simple to blame the religious ethos of the hospital.  Medical experts appeared to take the elitist attitude that they had the right to choose how mothers should plan their families.  Given that caesarean sections have been safe since the 1930s, there was no excuse for performing these procedures in 1944.</P>
      <P>At the very least, these people deserve to be told they were treated horrifically by the State and the medical profession.  The only way we can deal with the issue is by lifting the Statute of Limitations to allow them to seek redress in an independent and fair manner.  Peace and reconciliation commissions have been established in South Africa and on this island.  In this case we need a truth and reconciliation commission.  We need a forum whereby people who still believe they did nothing wrong for whatever reason meet the people on whom they foisted this abuse and their families.  Having listened both last night and previously to these ladies&rsquo; stories and the stories of their families &mdash; husbands, daughters and even grandchildren &mdash; it is clear their lives were utterly changed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am the eldest of eight and my mother is 81.  I feel so grateful that she was lucky enough not to have had to endure that.  Last night, I listened to one daughter talking about it to her mother.  My mother taught for 36 or 37 years as a schoolteacher and reared eight children.  She is lucky enough to have her health and all her faculties about her.  She used to say teaching was getting away from us, which is probably a fair assessment of what she had to do.</P>
      <P>Only for the bravery of a very small group of people who are left in bringing this story to our attention, this would have passed us by.  The men here are as moved by it as the female Members.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Even though we have enough reasons to divide the House, on this topic we have managed to unite to try to find a resolution to this terrible wrong that was done to these women.  They need at least to have faith in the structures of the State that acknowledges it in the first place and tries to deal with it as best we can.  While the Statute <Col N="671" />of Limitations is important, it is not the only part of it.  We need some sort of truth and reconciliation forum to allow people meet their demons on both sides.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me speak for a few moments on this important issue.  In the aftermath as we discuss it here in the calm light of Parliament we must reflect on the options available to women who were subjected to this treatment over a long number of years.  Notwithstanding medical science advances over the period, this practice continued on regardless for some reason that I do not know.  I have always developed a healthy respect for consultants and also the need to confront consultants and the basis for their opinions, although I do not always get applauded for it.  The practice that went on was, to say the least, archaic and savage.  It was more in concert with medieval times than with the 1930s, 1940s and more recent times.</P>
      <P>My first knowledge of this issue arose from a television programme because it was not a subject matter that was discussed too widely, and understandably so.  The women who were the victims of this practice were embarrassed.  They were embarrassed socially and would not even tell their families.  As a result there was a certain amount of silence.  However, that the process could continue unabated notwithstanding the fact that various people raised issues is a sad reflection on how we allow things to happen when we could and should do something about it.  It is particularly true in this instance.  This practice was carried out by qualified people who should have known better.  I do not want to draw inferences from other happenings in the 20th century where people in similar circumstances should have known better.  However, at this time we should be clear about one thing.  To my mind this is tantamount to criminal negligence &mdash; it is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>While we are discussing it in the calm aftermath, the people who carried out these practices knew full well the consequences at the time.  They could not but have known it and it was brought to their attention on numerous occasions.  Sadly, it took until now to get general recognition that a practice continued year after year that, to say the least, was prehistoric.  It was a savage and painful practice with a long-lasting negative impact on the individual women concerned.  It was totally unnecessary in the light of emerging science.  In those circumstances, we need to ask whether we can now put in place restrictions on the carrying out of any similar practices that might be found at a later stage to be detrimental to the health and well being of anybody in any sector of the community.  People who are in a vulnerable situation receiving treatment in hospital will automatically draw on the advice made available to them.  The presumption is that the best advice and the best attention is about to be given to them.  In this case, it was not, and the evidence shows it.</P>
      <P>None of my family members was a victim of this practice.  In one area of the country this seemed to be an ongoing practice that had become acceptable, which is a sad reflection on the health services in general.  I hope that what has been learnt from the discussion that has taken place on this issue will serve us in good stead in remembering not to allow practices such as this to go unabated in future and particularly not to allow them to go unchallenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this morning&rsquo;s debate I am struck by the level of cross-party agreement that this practice is barbaric.  The word &ldquo;savage&rdquo; has been used on several occasions this morning, which is what it is.  I was struck by the contribution of Deputy Ann Phelan, putting herself in that situation given that the practice was ongoing.  I compliment Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the former Deputy, Dr. Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, on the work they have done in this matter.  In particular, I thank Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for giving us this opportunity as Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann to unite in condemnation of this practice.</P>
      <Col N="672" />
      <P>As we come towards the end of these statements we need to give these people some sense of justice.  We need this report to be published.  I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment given that he acted very quickly on coming to office to commission the report.  However, I get very weary when I see the Office of the Attorney General involved in anything.  The Office of the Attorney General looks after laws and we have to look after justice.  As an Oireachtas, we have responsibility to deliver justice.  It may be necessary to put a bullet under someone to get moving and get this report issued so that we can see exactly where we go from there.</P>
      <P>We need to investigate the issue of clustering and why this was specific to certain areas.  There seem to be difficulties in a particular area regarding a range of health issues &mdash; I speak about the north east.  Many of the issues we discuss seem to come back to the north east area.  Perhaps it is time to have an overall inquiry into what was going on there rather than investigating the area topic by topic.</P>
      <P Just="Left">What redress will be given?  We can never compensate women for the hell they have endured with the complications following this procedure.  However, we can give some sort of indication for the financial hell they endured.  That also needs to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Some people have referred to the wider issue of the faith we place in consultants at a very difficult time.  In general, people need consultants at a difficult time when they are not in a very good frame of mind and have some sort of serious medical condition.  Many consultants do not respect or understand the position their patients are in when they go to them.  They treat patients and their families with a degree of contempt.  They do not give them information or lay out the options.  A large minority of them believe that a patient is blessed to be in their company &mdash; the majority are good decent people.  This is symptomatic of what was going on here &mdash; the doctor knows best and the patient will suffer the consequences.  We must ensure that culture is wiped out of our health system and ensure that the patient is put first, that the patient has rights and that the patient is treated as a citizen of the Republic with dignity and respect.  Personal opinions and beliefs and everything else should play second fiddle to the citizen&rsquo;s rights.</P>
      <P>In a week when there has been division and rancour in the Chamber I have been struck by the past two hours when there has been unity.  I did not make the briefing last night but I understand people who were there were shocked to the core.  Last night&rsquo;s briefing and this morning&rsquo;s debate will amount to a waste of time if we have to come back here again in two, three or four months time without a published report or some type of action plan.  We have done the talking and the empathy.  The Oireachtas will never really be able to understand what the victims of this savage procedure went through and are going through.  We must give them justice.  Our responsibility as legislators is to provide justice for our citizens.  Let us not return here unless we have a report and an action plan in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
      <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Deputies who raised the issue in the first instance and I thank those who spoke.  All of those who spoke have conveyed not only a great degree of sympathy but also the degree of urgency with which this issue must be addressed.  I commend the brave women who have spoken out.  I have no wish to dismiss men&rsquo;s experience, which is considerable, but as a woman it is very difficult to speak about something as personal and as debilitating as this procedure.  It is not simply about aspects of orthopaedics and so on.  In some cases this procedure led to inconti<Col N="673" />nence and this remains an issue.  This is something women find remarkably difficult to deal with in a social context, as anyone would.</P>
      <P>I have taken a particular interest in this area but I admit and I confess that I did not attend the recent briefing, because this is one area which I believe could take a night&rsquo;s sleep from me.  The barbarism inflicted and its consequences are unforgivable.  I met several Deputies who came from the briefing last night and who were rather traumatised.  Some Deputies had only heard about this issue for the first time.  They included male and female Deputies.  We cannot continue to pretend this did not happen.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was interested in Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s contribution.  She referred to the inquiry into the Magdalen laundries.  We have been left with historical and legacy issues which should have been dealt with several years ago but which were not.  We are now coming to grips with these.  I have discussed this issue at great length with the Minister and he believes, as do other members of the Government, that these issues cannot simply be left in abeyance.  It cannot be a case of deny-until-they-die Government.  We trust that this type of governance and Government is a thing of the past and we will deal with this.  We sought a report and a review which, we all agree, must take place quickly.  We cannot have the type of delays which occurred in the past.  This must be done quickly.  When the report is before us we will take a clear view of it, in consultation with not only the groups representing the women but with the women themselves, to determine the way forward.</P>
      <P>I will not read the official speech which provides a list of what is in place and what services are being provided.  We are all aware of the position.  Anyone who does not receive the services available should be proactive and determined about accessing them because the Government has provided for them.  There is no excuse.  No woman who has undergone this procedure should have need of the service but they need to be proactive in any case.  We must come to terms with our past.  I will not advert to what Deputy Calleary has already hinted at in terms of particular areas of the country and the procedures carried out there.  However, we must come to terms with the past.  I do not believe it was entirely an matter of ethos.  Certain practices were in place and there was a lack of control and administration.  A combination of forces came together to allow these things to happen.  I hope the code of conduct to be introduced for consultants and medical practitioners in general will ensure that we have safeguards in place against such a thing occurring again.</P>
      <P>I am loth to use the term &ldquo;these women&rdquo; because basically these women were mothers at the time.  They were women who went into what should have been a joyful occasion and came out to the sort of life we would expect.  Some were unable to care for their families and had to get certain supports.  In some instances these women were not understood and they were unable to explain why they were having particular difficulties.  I can only imagine what that was like.</P>
      <P>Some women suffer from depression after childbirth.  They have a great difficulty in explaining to people why they are not as joyful as others who have had babies.  I can only imagine what it must be like for these women to describe and explain something that was far more complicated and far less widespread.  We should keep this at the forefront of our mind as well.  We must be mindful of the lack of joy that came with having a new baby and the great difficulty not only in looking after that baby but in carrying out the other duties normally expected of them as well.  We must also keep in mind the sadness this must have brought about.</P>
      <P>We must deal with this.  We must recognise our past and we must accept that what took place in the past must be dealt with now.  However, this must be about the future and about protecting women who find themselves in this vulnerable position as well.  We must ensure that <Col N="674" />this never happens again with the new code of conduct.  We must also ensure that when the report comes before us we act as quickly as we can to determine the future not only for these women but for others who may find themselves in this position.  We must ensure we act quickly.  The days of putting it off are behind us.</P>
      <P>We are in a very difficult position financially but this should not stop us doing what is right and just.  A good deal has been put in place but we must do more.  I congratulate these women for having the courage to stand up and set out in detail what happened to them.</P>

        <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am the Chairperson-in-Office for the duration of our Chairmanship and bear overall responsibility for the executive action of the organisation. Ireland was one of the founding States of the OSCE and we have always recognised the Organisation&rsquo;s vital role in maintaining peace and security in Europe. I am honoured to chair the OSCE this year and greatly look forward to using this role to raise the profile of Ireland, thereby contributing to the restoration of our international reputation.</P>
        <P>The budget for our OSCE Chairmanship this year is &euro;7 million, about half of which will be required to host the OSCE Ministerial Council in Dublin this December. This Ministerial meeting is likely to be worth c. &euro;2m to the Irish economy, based on figures from Bord F&aacute;ilte on the likely spend per delegate. The total amount spent to date in 2012 is &euro;150,842. In 2011, a total of &euro;729,279 was spent on preparations for the Chairmanship year.</P>
        <P>As Chair, we will work consistently to ensure that the OSCE operates at the highest level of efficiency and to keep costs at a minimum. The Secretary General of the OSCE is also very aware of current economic restraints. He is actively examining how the OSCE operates and exploring various reform proposals so as to strengthen its institutional core and capacities.</P>
        <P>Ireland will reap several benefits from the Chairmanship of the OSCE, including a significantly raised EU and international profile. It will enhance the reputation we already have for skilled diplomacy and crisis management and expand our conflict resolution and human rights expertise; both important features of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. It will provide us with an opportunity to have close and sustained engagement with major international players, such as the United States, Russia, France and Germany, and with countries with which we would have fewer opportunities for engagement, such as the countries of Central Asia. These links will also allow us to assess and develop trade links across the OSCE area.</P>

        <P>Since 2004, my Department has provided funding to Irish emigrants living in Britain under the Emigrant Support Programme. Prior to this Irish Government funding was referred to as the Dion fund. The emphasis of the ESP is on supporting culturally sensitive front-line welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas (particularly in Britain and the United States), reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements. Between 2004 and 2011 over &euro;93 million has been provided under the Programme of which almost &euro;68 million was paid to organisations in Britain.  In 2011, &euro;11.3 million was provided to support over 200 organisations in twenty countries worldwide including &euro;7.8m in respect of 114 organisations in Britain.  Recommendations for grants in Britain are agreed in conjunction with the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC). </P>
        <P>I am pleased that despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained funding under the ESP at a significant level (&euro;11.6m) for 2012.  The 2012 grant round closed on 29 February and applications for funding are currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>The table below sets out the annual breakdown of grants made since 1987 to organisations in Britain who support Irish emigrants living there.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Report of the Task Force on Irish Emigrants, published in 2002, proposed a wide range of measures aimed at improving the support provided by the State to Irish emigrants, including pre-departure services, and enhancing the strategic engagement between Ireland and its Diaspora. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Report led to the establishment of the Irish Abroad Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2004. This Unit has responsibility for developing Government policy towards Irish communities abroad and the wider Irish Diaspora and management of the annual Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) grant round. Since 2004, over &euro;93m has been provided, through the Emigrant Support Programme, to Irish organisations in some 23 countries worldwide. The emphasis of the ESP is on supporting culturally sensitive front-line welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas (particularly in Britain and the United States), reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Abroad Unit has also transformed the level of engagement between Ireland and business and cultural leaders within the Diaspora through the Global Irish Economic Forum and the establishment of the Global Irish Network. This is consistent with the findings of the Task Force on Irish Emigrants. I am pleased that despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained funding under the ESP at a significant level (&euro;11.6m) for 2012. The 2012 grant round closed on 29 February and applications for funding are currently being assessed.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Joint Task Force established under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the relationship between the Customs and Excise service of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with respect to Drugs Law Enforcement dated 2 January 1996, and approved by the ad-hoc group in May of 1996, is charged to operate as a partnership. The Joint Task Force arrangements are activated in response to specific operational developments and the Joint Task Force does not therefore exist as a separate permanent structure.  The number of personnel allocated to the Joint Task Force from each agency will be determined by the circumstances and requirements of each particular operation.</P>
        <Col N="678" />
        <P>There is no separate financial allocation to cover the costs of Joint Task Force operations. Such costs are borne by the respective agencies involved and are included in the general operational budgets of the agencies.</P>
        <P>In 2011 Joint Task Force operations included fifty-six controlled deliveries which resulted in the seizure of drugs including 205 kilograms of cannabis, 109 kilograms of cocaine, and 7 kilograms of other drugs with an estimated street value in excess of &euro;10 million. These operations also resulted in the arrest of thirty-eight persons in relation to drug trafficking offences.  In addition ten intelligence based operations focusing on the smuggling of cannabis, cocaine and other drugs by various means including the maritime, road freight and aviation sectors were carried out.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Sligo Revenue office received notification of the death of the person in question on 4th February 2011 from the solicitors acting on behalf of the estate.  Pages 1 to 5 of form CA 24 were also enclosed. The office replied to this correspondence on 28 February 2011 asking for a copy of the Will and Grant of Probate as well as the outstanding pages (6 to 8) of form CA 24. These papers were received on 10th March 2011. Upon examination of the additional pages of form CA 24, a further query was sent to the Solicitors acting on behalf of the estate on 15th March 2011 and a reply was received on 28th April 2011.</P>
        <P>Based on the information received, a letter issued on 12th May 2011 to the solicitors acting on behalf of the estate confirming that there was no outstanding pre-death income tax due. If the Deputy considers that there is some other issue outstanding, he should advise Revenue directly and the matter will be examined.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
        <P>There are measures in place to assist guarantors of mortgages. I have no plans to introduce additional measures.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code. The Code contains a number of provisions that are relevant to the guarantors of loans to private consumers. For example, provision 4.26 of the Code states that where credit is being offered to a personal consumer, subject to a guarantee, the guarantee documentation must outline the obligations of the guarantor and must contain the following warning statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Warning: As a guarantor of this credit, you will have to pay off the debt amount, the interest and all associated charges up to the level of your guarantee if the borrower(s) do(es) not. Before you sign this guarantee you should get independent legal advice&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Provision 6.8 requires that &ldquo;where a regulated entity has advanced credit to a personal consumer subject to a guarantee, the regulated entity must notify the guarantor on paper or on another durable medium, if the terms of the credit agreement change&rdquo;.  Provision 8.6 requires that &ldquo;where an account remains in arrears 31 calendar days after the arrears first arose, a regulated entity must, within three business days, inform the personal consumer and any guarantor of the loan, on paper or on another durable medium, of the status of the account&rdquo;. Provision 8.6 goes on to list information that has to be provided to the personal consumer and guarantor under this provision.  A copy of the central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>As I stated in my recent Budget speech, I intend to keep the contentious issue of so-called &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; under constant review, and to that end a public consultation will be undertaken on possible changes to our tax residence rules to ensure such individuals make a fair contribution.  Measures which will be considered will include possible changes to the day counting rules for residence, supplementing the day counting rules with other criteria, and examination of other related measures, including the Domicile Levy. There was much comment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill about the small number of individuals who paid the Domicile Levy and the low yield from the tax.  It should be noted that if an individual pays more than &euro;200,000 in income tax in a particular year he or she will not be required to pay the levy, even if he or she meets the other conditions.  So it is not necessarily the case that certain individuals whom one might expect to pay the levy are not otherwise making a significant tax contribution.  An individual can also use any income tax paid in the tax year as a credit against his/her Domicile Levy liability.</P>
        <P>The Domicile Levy is payable by an individual who is both an Irish citizen and Irish domiciled whose Irish assets exceed &euro;5 million, whose worldwide income exceeds &euro;1 million and whose liability to Irish income tax for the relevant year is less than &euro;200,000. One reason the levy yield was relatively small is that the combination of the various conditions meant that very few people were obliged to pay it.  My announcement in the Budget that the citizenship condition will be removed should have the effect of increasing the number of people who are eligible to pay the levy.</P>
        <P>The small number of taxpayers means the levy yield is particularly vulnerable to volatility in the economy which would lead to changes in an individual&rsquo;s income and asset values.  I therefore do not propose to project the yield from the levy in 2012.  However, the removal of the citizenship condition will only apply from the 2012 tax year onwards.  Since the levy for a particular year is payable on or before 31 October of the following year, the removal of the citizenship condition will only affect the Domicile Levy yield from 2013 onwards.</P>

        <Quest> if he will confirm, further to Parliamentary Question No. 123, that the EBA peer review team was aware of and approved <Col N="681" />all amendments to methodologies and changes to formulas applied by the Irish banks or the Central Bank of Ireland to the stress tests in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to recent parliamentary questions (Nos. 122 of 22 November 2011, 42 to 44, inclusive, of 6 December 2011 and 166 of 21 February 2012), which address the query raised in his latest question. The position as regards this matter has not changed. I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) that it assisted the European Banking Authority (EBA) in carrying out a European-wide bank solvency stress test in July 2011. The test was applied to three Irish banks in accordance with a methodology that was pre-agreed with the EBA. As a result of the significant restructuring underway in the Irish banking system at the time, the methodology applied by the EBA to the Irish banks differed in some respects to that prescribed to the other European banks participating in the exercise. The differences in methodology were introduced to fully account for the Irish banks requirement to deleverage their balance sheets in the coming years and also to consider the detailed loan loss forecasts produced by BlackRock Solutions on behalf of the CBI earlier in 2011 as part of the Irish PCAR stress tests. By taking account of the negative impact of the asset disposals and the losses forecast by BlackRock, the Irish banks were subject to a much tougher stress test than other banks participating in the European stress test. In addition, Irish, Greek and Portuguese banks were issued with separate cost of funds instructions to account for the impact of the sovereign spreads and external support programmes.</P>
        <P>In order to assure quality in the process and the outputs in the European stress test, the EBA assigned a team of independent peer reviewers to verify that methodologies were applied consistently and correctly. This team, which comprised of senior European stress testing experts, worked with the CBI to validate and verify the submissions made by the Irish banks. This iterative process resulted in many clarifications leading to instructions to each of the Irish banks. Once updated submissions were received from the banks, the CBI checked and subsequently forwarded them on to the EBA for further validation and review. The results/submissions made by the Irish Banks were not amended in any way before being forwarded on to the EBA peer review team.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the CBI, that one of their employees expressed a concern over the way in which the EBA stress testing procedure was applied in Ireland. In response, CBI management commissioned an investigation. This investigation was conducted by the CBI&rsquo;s Internal Audit Department under the CBI&rsquo;s &lsquo;speak-up&rsquo; policy. Based on the report of this investigation, which has been accepted by the employee, CBI Management are satisfied that, while the complaint was made in good faith, there is no reason for concern with the figures provided to the EBA.</P>
        <P>Despite the additional conservatism applied to the Irish banks, all three Irish banks passed the European stress test. This is a direct result of applying a much tougher PCAR stress test earlier in 2011, as part of the Irish Financial Measures Programme, and requiring the banks to recapitalise based on the results of that stress test. The PCAR stress test was overseen by a series of independent observers, including the Troika, and was widely regarded by market participants as being credible and a benchmark on information disclosure that other supervisory authorities should follow.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Promissory Note arrangement is essentially an arrangement between the Government and IBRC. The Government has provided Promissory Notes to IBRC and undertaken to repay the principal and interest payments in accordance with a repayment schedule. However, the Promissory is accepted as collateral for the Exceptional/emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) by the Central bank of Ireland and as such there is an implicit link between the current repayment schedule on the Promissory Note and ELA provided by the Central Bank.  Any discussions in relation to ELA would of necessity have to include the ECB. The EU Commission and the EU heads of Government are one step further removed from the initial arrangement between the Government and IBRC. However given our approach to addressing the heavy debt burden, involving the Troika in developing a technical solution or range of solutions and given that possible alternative sources of long-term funding may involve the EU Commission, it is not unreasonable to assume that any solution may require the approval or acquiescence of Member States whether formally at heads of Government level, or less formally through the structures of the European Commission. However, it is important to await the outcome of the technical review to properly assess what is required to get an appropriate solution in place. In the meantime the Government will avail of every opportunity to garner support for the work in hand and for a positive outcome for the country.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. I can confirm to the Deputy that both banks have achieved their 2011 targets.  I should stress that the targets are for approvals of credit and have not been imposed for drawdowns.  I would point out that the drawdown of funding is at the discretion of the borrower. There are many factors affecting whether or not funding is drawn down, such as changes in market conditions or company restructuring. </P>
        <P>The recent Mazars Survey of SME Lending, conducted on behalf of my Department, found that, in the period April-September 2011, 36% of SMEs surveyed requested bank credit. Excluding pending applications, 70% of these applications were approved or partially approved.</P>
        <P>The ISME Quarterly Bank Watch Survey, which was published earlier this week, has a base of 904 respondents but the means of conducting the survey is not explained. It is understood that the survey is internet based, which has obvious difficulties with self-selection of people who have specific complaints, leading to potential bias in the survey. As I mentioned previously, the lending targets for the pillar banks are for loan approvals not drawdowns. ISMEs own figures show that only 66% of firms who were approved for credit have drawn it down either in full or in part. The most frequent reasons cited in the Mazars survey for not availing of <Col N="683" />approved credit continues to be &ldquo;not needed at present time&rdquo;, which was cited by 80% of respondents.</P>
        <P>I would urge people with viable propositions who are refused credit to go to the CRO and not to let anything discourage them from doing so. The CRO overturns 50% of bank refusals and provides a user-friendly service to borrowers.</P>

        <P>The letter signed by the Finance Ministers of nine EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) supported the introduction of a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) and asked the current Danish Presidency of the EU to accelerate discussions on the current draft proposal from the EU Commission. I will not be making a formal submission in response to this letter but I have indicated that I do not favour accelerating the discussions, as Ireland believes the proposal should be given the fullest possible consideration.</P>
        <P>The current draft proposal is still being examined at EU Council Working Party level and was discussed at ECOFIN this week.  I have made clear in the past my view that, if an FTT cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on an EU-wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Government is committed to reviewing the approach to the Promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State. The troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc. </P>
        <P>As part of the discussions with the troika there has been some consideration of looking at not just enhancing the State&rsquo;s debt sustainability but also looking at enhancements to the bank<Col N="684" />ing system which could, further down the line, increase the value of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in those banks. At this point in time there are a number of issues under consideration but it is far too early in proceedings to talk about specific outcomes.</P>
        <P>Tracker mortgages tend to earn low margins for the banks so removal of them from their balance sheets if this were to occur, would likely improve the profitability of those institutions, putting them on a more sustainable footing.</P>

        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands on my Department&rsquo;s capital resources and in this context it must prioritise applications for the provision of much needed additional classroom accommodation.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that there are over 110 schools availing of transport under the closed school rule in County Donegal, of which some 50 schools have children who may be affected. The list of these schools is below.  The cohort of eligible CSR children attending these schools will continue to be eligible for transport, subject to meeting the distance criteria and that there is no change in their circumstances. The cessation of eligibility under that rule applies only in the case of children commencing their primary education from September 2012.  It should be noted that the decision to implement this change was announced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party  Government in the Budget announced in December 2010. </P>

        <P>The reasoning behind my Department insisting that the new permanent structures replacing rented prefabs must be independent of the existing school campus is to ensure that the maximum number of schools benefit from this initiative.  While there may be, in some cases, limited potential costs related to the provision of services, my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit is satisfied that the level of funding being provided to individual schools is sufficient to meet the costs of replacing prefabricated structures with permanent buildings on a stand-alone basis.</P>

        <P>While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department&rsquo;s budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012. The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.  Budget 2012 <Col N="690" />provided that all 195 second-level schools in DEIS will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. The Deputy will be aware however that I have already indicated to the House that the proposed withdrawal of DEIS posts from DEIS second level schools will proceed.</P>
        <P>At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support, i.e., curricular concessions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The allocation processes also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school&rsquo;s overall allocation.  Details of the appeal process are set out in Circular 0009/2012 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Appeal Board operate independently of the Department and its decisions are final.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the three post primary schools in the area that he refers to have agreed to amalgamate to form a new Community School.  The amalgamation can proceed when a new school building has been provided. In this regard, a site is being progressed by my Department and when the site is secured the building project will be considered for progression.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. It is not possible, therefore, to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

        <P>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school is required to organise its subject options and, from September 2012 the provision of guidance, from within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. My Department provides some short-term support through the annual curricular concessions process for those schools that have particular short-term difficulties managing their subject provision.  As part of the budgetary decisions the Department sheltered DEIS post-primary schools by reducing the pupil teacher ratio to 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-<Col N="691" />paying second-level schools. Matters in relation to the deployment of teaching staff and the range of subjects offered are dealt with at local school level rather than centrally by my Department. My Department does not therefore have the specific information readily available that is sought by the Deputy.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 39 together.</P>
        <P>The staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year are set out in Primary Circular 0007/2012, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools. The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs. This should be completed by schools by 16 March.</P>
        <P>As part of the reforms to the teacher allocation process existing posts are being used to put in place a network of over 2,500 full-time resource posts in close to 1,700 base schools throughout the country. These posts will be allocated on a permanent basis and the teachers in them will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools. This approach builds on the interim arrangements that operated in 2011 but in a more structured and transparent manner.</P>
        <P>While individual schools may have their own particular preferences the Department has to look at it from a national perspective. The overall objective with these reforms is to enable the teacher allocation and redeployment process to operate more smoothly and efficiently within the new climate of fixed ceilings on teaching posts. The changes are designed to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify and streamline existing processes and give greater autonomy to schools.</P>
        <P>It also has to be borne in mind that the previous clustering arrangements included inherent inefficiencies whereby schools could retain full-time posts on less than 25 hours (some on as low as 19 hours). The new GAM arrangements operate in 5-hour blocks to facilitate, as appropriate, the day to day operation of GAM support between schools and also ensure that full-time GAM posts are fully utilised (25 hours in each post). The Department will also be requiring any surplus capacity in full-time resource posts to be fully utilised before it approves part-time resource posts for neighbouring schools.  My Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible. As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, total school enrolments are expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 &mdash; by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary. Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  Recent birth rate data, published by the CSO shows there were nearly 20,000 births registered in the first quarter of 2011. This is the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960. It is vital that the schooling system is prepared to cope with these increasing numbers. Therefore, the Government&rsquo;s priority is now to focus on major school projects to meet these demographic demands.</P>
        <P>The Five Year Plan prioritises new school building projects as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established. School building projects currently in architectural planning were considered in the context of that programme, taking into account the funding available, the availability of sites in the case of new schools and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs. In that regard, the scheduling of selected projects depends also on when such projects are technically ready to proceed to tender and construction.</P>
        <P>In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs.</P>

        <P>Syllabus planners in all subjects, including Irish are already very conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to textbooks. Their aim is to minimise the cost burden for parents.  School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. My Department has consistently encouraged schools to put in place book rental schemes as the most effective means of lowering costs for all parents.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 to 42, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>From September 2012 the combined resources available for GAM (General Allocation Model) and language support are being merged into a single simplified allocation process. The need to reform the allocation of the GAM arose because the existing system operated on the basis of 2003 enrolments which are long out of date and had been criticised by the Ombudsman for Children.  Schools will have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements also provide for over 370 additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. These arrangements are set out in the Department Circular 0007/2012 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Some of the schools referred to by the Deputy have been allocated some of these posts which reflects the fact that they have high concentrations of pupils that require language support.  The full list of all the relevant schools are included as part of the Department Circular 0007/2012.</P>
        <P>Further additional temporary language support will also be provided including if necessary to the schools referred to by the Deputy.  The mechanism for this is through appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board by any schools that will have high concentrations of pupils that require language support in the 2012/13 school.  The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board is 23 March, 2012. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <P>My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students, both girls and boys, to choose science subjects.  I am encouraged by the significant increase in the number of students applying to the CAO for science courses this year.</P>
        <P>An important element of the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 is to increase the proportions of students studying the physical sciences in senior cycle. Revised draft syllabuses in Physics, Chemistry and Biology have been developed by the NCCA which provide a strong focus on practical investigative approaches and practical assessment, as a follow on from the changes introduced at junior cycle in 2003.</P>
        <P>The recent consultation on these syllabi by the NCCA has just concluded. The Department is awaiting the NCCA&rsquo;s proposals on Leaving Certificate Science Syllabuses.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having a range of options to choose from. Good and enthusiastic science teachers have the opportunity to inspire a real interest in their subject and so ensure that pupils will want to choose to study their science subject in senior cycle.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>Last January I asked my officials to examine the net impact, in terms of posts, that certain Budget measures would have on DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 primary schools. The main focus of this examination concerned additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes predating DEIS. The outcome of this report was published last month and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>There are 328 DEIS Rural primary schools. This category of educational disadvantage has always differed to Band 1 and Band 2 and so was not within the scope of the review I had asked my officials to consider. DEIS Rural Primary schools have never been allocated preferential pupil teacher ratios as their rural location tends to ensure they have lower class sizes.</P>
        <P>Arising from the decisions taken following the review, of the 328 DEIS Rural primary schools, 16 of these schools with legacy posts will lose one teaching post each.</P>

        <P>The Department of Health has responsibility for policy in relation to rehabilitative training and sheltered work.  Responsibility for the delivery of these services rests with the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Rehabilitative training and sheltered work is provided largely in accredited training centres that are run by the HSE or by service providers contracted by the HSE and designated sheltered workshops.  Rehabilitative training focuses on the development of an individual&rsquo;s life skills, social skills and basic work skills with the objective of enhancing the trainee&rsquo;s quality of life and general work capacity. </P>
        <P>The award of public contracts is governed by EU Treaty principles and Directives on public procurement.  Article 19 of the EU Directive 2004/18 allows contracting authorities to reserve certain contracts for specific sheltered workshops where most of the employees concerned are people with disabilities that would prevent them from carrying on an occupation under normal conditions.  Specifying such conditions is a matter for the contracting authority concerned, having regard to the foregoing considerations.  Details of individual contracts or indeed sub-contracts are not held centrally.</P>
        <P>In relation to developing awareness of this Article, the National Procurement Service, offer training and support to buyers and suppliers in order to raise awareness of public procurement opportunities for sheltered workshops.</P>

        <P>As I have already told the House on a number of occasions, the sale of State assets under the Governments programme announced last month will be transacted via an open, transparent and competitive process, in order to ensure that the State achieves value for any assets being sold.  In that context, the credentials of any potential purchasers will, of course, be established and verified in the course of any competitive tendering process.</P>
        <P>There remains a considerable amount of preparatory work to be completed over the remainder of 2012, before the Government will be in a position to initiate a sales transaction.  I have already indicated that the Government would not envisage transactions commencing until 2013.  However, in the meantime, we have already seen considerable interest being expressed in our asset disposal programme from a wide range of potential investors.  I can again assure the Deputy that great care will be taken at all times to ensure any disposals are in the national interest and represent value for the Exchequer.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to make Ireland a leader in the emerging IT market of Cloud Computing by promoting greater use of Cloud Computing in the public sector; organising existing State supports for Cloud Computing into a package to promote Ireland as a progressive place for IT investment; and, establishing an expert group to:- address privacy and security issues arising from the use of cloud computing, review the adequacy of current legislation, and, identify what steps need to be taken to ensure a supportive regulatory environment for Cloud Computing.</P>
        <P>In accordance with this commitment, I announced the establishment of a cross Government Implementation Group on Cloud Computing in June 2011.  The Group is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and comprises representatives of Departments and Agencies responsible for aspects of Cloud Computing policy including expenditure, IT Procurement, security, infrastructure and enterprise strategy.  The Group has met on three occasions to date and is currently in the process of finalising its report for submission to me.  The Group&rsquo;s work was complemented by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in 23 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies being facilitated by my Department.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the Cloud Technology Centre, which I referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Question No 228 of 6 March 2012, was formally announced by me in May 2011.  The Centre is being jointly established by Enterprise Ireland and IDA.  As I indicated in my <Col N="700" />reply to the earlier question, I am happy that good progress is being made in delivering on this commitment.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Programme for Government, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has been working to bring about greater promotion of Cloud Computing in the Public Service.  The Acton Plans for Jobs reiterates the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to developing a Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Sector in 2012.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>State pension (transition) (SPT) and State pension (contributory) (SPC) are social insurance payments made when a person reaches 65 and 66 years of age respectively.  They are both based on the person&rsquo;s social insurance record (PRSI) from employment or self employment.</P>
        <P>To qualify a person needs to (<i>a</i>) enter insurable employment by age 55 for SPT and age 56 for SPC, (<i>b</i>) have paid 260 full rate social insurance contributions and (<i>c</i>) have a yearly average contributions of at least 10 for SPT and at least 24 for SPC.  A person must be retired from employment to qualify for SPT and the payment ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to SPC.  The yearly average determines the weekly rate of payment.  Class S PRSI contributions which are payable by self-employed people are not reckonable for SPT and therefore, the changes proposed in this area will not apply to this cohort.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  So the task of <Col N="702" />financing our increasing number of pensioners will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  People are living longer and healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  Recognising that State pensions are very valuable benefits, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over a working life thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.</P>
        
        <P>In this context there are a number of pension reform measures planned:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> The minimum paid contributions requirement for SPT and SPC will increase to 520 in April 2012 as provided for in legislation since 1997.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> As provided for in recent legislation, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66 and SPT will no longer be payable to those who reach age 65 in 2014 or later.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> A &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.  The proposed date for its introduction is 2020.  Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  This change reflects the potential that people now have to accumulate contributions as a result of the comprehensive nature of social insurance coverage which has been in place for 20 years, and the growth in the labour force over that period.  Accordingly, a total contributions requirement of 30 years&rsquo; contributions for a maximum pension will be introduced.  Under the new approach, a minimum rate of State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable at one third (10/30ths) of the maximum rate, which will be 30/30ths.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A further reform measure was announced in Budget 2012 providing for a change to the rates bands for SPT and SPC which is being introduced from September 2012.   From then, the rate band of between 20 and 47 (24 and 47 for SPT) yearly average contributions will be replaced with new rate bands of between:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions,</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) 30 and 39 yearly average contribution, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(iii) 20 and 29 yearly average contributions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therefore, the rate of SPT or SPC paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid over a working life.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.  While existing pension recipients are unaffected, the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.</P>
        <P>Claimants who qualify for a reduced rate of SPT or SPC and who have income needs may qualify, depending on their means, for another social welfare payment.  Details of the new rates bands for SPC are set out in the tables below.</P>
        <P>The measures outlined support the social contract between the State and the individual whereby those who pay most in a working life benefit most in retirement.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of the &euro;10 million humanitarian assistance scheme set up in the aftermath of flooding in October 2011 that has been allocated; how this money has been spent; and if she intends to adjust the criteria for receipt of funding. </Quest>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the immediate aftermath of the severe flooding experienced in October 2011, the Government put in place a humanitarian aid scheme to assist households affected by that flooding. </P>
        <P>Since these floods, the Department has been providing individuals with emergency payments to offset their immediate needs such as the purchase of food, clothing, fuel and household goods. Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.  Funding towards alternative accommodation costs have also been made in certain cases depending on the circumstances of the families.</P>
        <P>Larger payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as assisting with the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again are also being made. This type of payment will take longer as homeowners must first establish the cost of repair and engage a builder to carry out the repairs.  Items not covered by the scheme include losses covered by an insurance policy, loss of inessential or luxury items, commercial or business losses and loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation.</P>
        <P>To date 806 payments have been made at a total cost of &euro;515,000.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to adjust the criteria for receipt of funding. Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the October 2011 floods should contact the local Department of Social Protection representative administering the supplementary allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</P>

        <Quest> if she will reverse the decision <Col N="704" />to close the community welfare office service in Malahide, Dublin, from 20 March 2012, forcing residents to attend at Kilbarrack, Dublin, to access this service. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, there is currently a moratorium on recruitment across the civil and public service. Where vacancies arise, I assure the Deputy that the Department is expending every effort to continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies, including those arising from retirements, by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the Employment Control Framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, having regard to workloads, management priorities and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.  It was in this context that the decision was made to relocate community welfare services from Malahide to Kilbarrack following the retirement of a staff member and other staffing issues.</P>
        <P>As part of a reconfiguration of services, the community welfare clinic currently operating in Malahide will relocate to Kilbarrack Health Centre from Tuesday 20 March 2012.  This measure is required in order to maintain continued public access to the service for customers currently covered by the community welfare service in Malahide.</P>
        <P>A factor taken into account in the reconfiguration of services was the good public transport services from Malahide to Kilbarrack, with Dart and bus access to Kilbarrack Health Centre, which is 5 minutes walk from the nearest train station or bus stop.</P>
        <P>There is also the facility for clients who are unable to travel to Kilbarrack, for example due to illness, to phone the community welfare service in Kilbarrack and discuss their case and, if required, the officer may arrange a visit to the client&rsquo;s home.</P>
        <P>In order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to clients, the Department is undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES), which will bring together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the former Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency Schemes from the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  It is the intention that the NEES will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit, to provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to clients. It is hoped that this integrating process will also deliver new opportunities to support service delivery at the local level.</P>

        <P>In order to qualify for an internship, an individual must be in receipt of a live jobseeker&rsquo;s claim and have been in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, or signing for credits, for a minimum of 78 days in the previous six months.  Time spent on certain government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility. </P>
        <P>Providing they fulfil all JobBridge eligibility criteria regarding jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance/benefit, persons in part-time employment can participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme provided that their employer is not the provider of the internship.  The intern must advise their local Social Welfare office of their continued part-time employment while undertaking an internship.</P>
        <P>A standard Internship working week will range from 30-40 hours per week.  Therefore an intern will be required to participate on the scheme for a minimum of 30 hours and a maximum of 40 hours per week.  Hence, an additional requirement is that the part-time employment does not interfere with the minimum weekly hours (thirty) of the internship.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor and review the eligibility criteria for the JobBridge programme on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Individuals who are not in receipt of social welfare payments and are working part-time may also access the Work Placement Programme wherein there is a minimum requirement to work 25 hours per week with a Host Organisation.</P>

        <Quest> the number of qualifying applicants who now remain in the rural broadband scheme since the deadline of 2 March; the length of time it is proposed to allow operators in which to provide services to those remaining; and if any of the &euro;17.9m budgeted for this scheme has been allocated to other projects or purposes. </Quest>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">The Rural Broadband Scheme was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, mainly due to technical difficulties.  This Scheme is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual unserved premises in rural non-National Broadband Scheme areas who wish to avail of such services.  Approximately 3,700 applications qualified under the Scheme and the Verification Phase of the Scheme is now under way.  Under this phase, the details of applicants have been passed to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who are participating in the Scheme and these companies have responded to my Department indicating where they may be able to offer services.</P>
        <Col N="708" />
        <P>Letters were issued to applicants on 17 February asking them to give their consent to be contacted by those ISPs who had indicated that they could offer them a service.  The deadline for the return of consent forms has been extended to 16 March 2012 and reminder letters have been issued to applicants who have not yet responded.</P>
        <P>After the new deadline has passed, my Department will be providing further information to the participating ISPs to enable them to write to applicants with offers of service.  I expect that these written offers will be sent out in April and, subject to final agreement with the ISPs concerned, the provision of services to applicants during this phase of the Scheme will be carried out over the period May to July this year.</P>
        <P>The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all premises in the country are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Where a commercial service has been shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what amount, if any, of the EU funding available for this project through the Rural Development Programme will be required, I can assure the Deputy that it is the intention of both the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that the fund is fully utilised for rural development measures and that there is no loss of funding for Ireland as a whole.</P>

        <P>The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT) has proven to be a very useful forum for detailed discussions with some industry stakeholders on their views regarding the optimal policy required to facilitate investment in next generation broadband infrastructure.  The Taskforce is currently finalising its deliberations.  I expect it will conclude its deliberation in the coming weeks.  The next steps, following completion of the NGBT report, will be to bring the report to Government before consulting with the wider public for their views.  Building on the work of the Taskforce, it is my intention to publish a National Broadband Plan for Ireland later this year which will set out a range of policy commitments and actions aimed at accelerating the rollout of high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>

        <P>The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, which is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a national system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a <Col N="709" />gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</P>
        <P>The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers.  The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</P>
        <P>Having full regard to CER&rsquo;s network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy.  The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER.  The study included an appraisal of Tralee, Listowel and Killarney as a group of towns.  The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Tralee, Listowel and Killarney, when appraised on an individual basis or as a group, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</P>
        <P>Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</P>

        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge. </P>
        <P>The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January, 2012 to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, that person is required to declare that liability and to pay the household charge by 31 March, 2012.</P>
        <P>I understand, from data provided by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), that as of 13 March, 2012, a total of 229,650 properties have been registered for payment of the household charge. This equates to some &euro;23 million.  The LGMA does not have the sub-national details of the registrations sought in the question.</P>

        <P>My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010. That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct and provide a further suite of options for the sympathetic treatment of mortgage arrears by local authorities my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association. </P>
        <P>Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage productively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.

        <P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows: category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; category two, where a receiver has been appointed; category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents. </P>
        <P>Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>: the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development; the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission; the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007; the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act; the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</P>
        <P>This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge. Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</P>

In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order or by credit/debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.

        <TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 to 88, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements, including recruitment and day to day <Col N="715" />operational measures, necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  Under the terms of the moratorium on recruitment, any exceptions in respect of local authorities require prior sanction from my Department. In this regard, it is a matter for City and County managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained.  My Department works very closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts are filled while overall numbers are reduced.</P>
        <P>I understand that the position in relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade is kept under constant review by Dublin City Council management and that the panel which was in place since 2007 expired in December 2011.  Dublin City Council has reduced its overall staff numbers from 7,326.15 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) in June 2008 to 6,072.35 in December 2011, a reduction of 1,254 (17%). In the same period the total number of full time fire fighters in Dublin City Council increased from 825 WTE to 876 WTE.  The cost of operational overtime for Dublin Fire Brigade in 2010 was &euro;3.095m and in 2011 it was &euro;3.09m. This is expected to reduce in 2012.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Report of the Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland was published by my Department.  The principal recommendations included more focus on fire safety, including the introduction of community fire safety initiatives; the enhancement of fire safety legislation, the adoption of a risk-based approach to determining emergency cover as well as new approaches and structures for major emergency management.  In addition, the Report called for continued capital investment to improve infrastructure and further development of safety, health and welfare arrangements.  Much has been accomplished in the past decade since publication of the Report and the key recommendations of the Report have been implemented.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 113 of 28 September 2011 which confirmed that his Department supports a broad range of social interventions, including community warden schemes, under the sustainable communities fund and as part of the national regeneration programme, if funding will continue to be provided in the current year by his Department for community warden posts in Sligo as part of the overall regeneration programme for the Sligo eastern quadrant; if the number of community warden posts in Sligo will be increased in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>My Department is committed to funding the completion of a comprehensive master plan for the Sligo regeneration project together with a number of community based social and physical regeneration measures, including the community wardens scheme.  My Department currently provides funding for the employment of two community wardens and there are no proposals to increase this number in 2012.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the response given by the European Commission on 21 February 2012 to Question No. E-012350/2011 in the European Parliament.  I am satisfied that the Building Control Act 2007 is in keeping with the requirements of relevant EU legislation and, in particular, the provisions of Directive 2005/36/EC as regards the free movement of workers within the single market and the recognition by Member States of the qualifications of individuals from other Member States.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 27 of 30 November 2011 which sets out the arrangements already in place under the Building Control Act 2007 for the registration of practically trained persons as architects.  To date 31 practically trained persons have been deemed eligible for inclusion on the register of architects.  Of these, 6 underwent the technical assessment process and 25 underwent the register admission examination.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to amend the Act along the lines suggested and, as such, I do not propose to meet with members of the alliance as requested.  I would encourage members of the alliance to pursue the routes to registration which are currently open to them with a view to joining the small and growing numbers of practically trained architects already on the register.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>In January 2010, the Local and Community Development Programme superseded the Community Development and the Local Development Social Inclusion Programmes. </P>
        <P>The objective of the new Programme is to tackle poverty, and social exclusion through partnership, and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>As part of its four high level goals, the Programme supports individuals into employment, and self-employment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise, and the social economy in both urban and rural areas.</P>
        <P>The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and is delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of 51 Local Development Companies. This year some &euro;55m has been allocated to the Programme.</P>
        <P>In July 2011, a review of the Programme was carried out. The focus of the review was on the performance in relation to a number of high priority indicators concerning leverage of resources (Goal 1), education and training (Goal 2), and labour market activities (Goal 3).</P>
        <Col N="717" />
        <P>While it is early in the life of the new Programme, the 2010 performance (when examined against a range of indicators, 6 case studies and a random sample of 15 area strategic plans) indicates:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> progress on establishing outcomes;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> a provision for enhanced monitoring and planning;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> a strategic collaboration with other agencies; and</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> functioning links between providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The following information provides figures in relation to the performance of the Programme in 2010:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> Out of 30,140 participants, 24,640 were new beneficiaries (82%);</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> Nearly 43% of participants were long term unemployed;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 12,112 individuals received education/training supports;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 4,649 individuals participated in accredited courses;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 2,324 individuals gained certified qualifications;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 4,595 were supported into employment;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 1,568 individuals were assisted or placed in employment with slightly more women than men, and 3,027 were supported into self-employment, with the majority of these being men (2,328); and</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 3,565 people received new enterprise supports.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Overall, I am satisfied that the objectives of the Programme are being met. The programme will continue to support the participation and empowerment of local communities in tackling disadvantage, and will have an emphasis on front-line support, and service provision.  Operating and overhead costs are being kept to a minimum, which, in the current climate, is essential and provides for resources to be directed in a targeted, and effective, manner to ensure that those we work to assist will receive maximum benefit.</P>

        <P>The community-based CCTV Scheme was first launched in 2005 to provide financial assistance towards the capital costs of establishing a community CCTV system.  The Scheme provided for two types of grants: a pre-development grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist local communities to develop proposals and substantive grants of up to &euro;100,000 towards the capital cost of establishing a system.  In addition, separate and matching funding was provided for successful applications from RAPID areas.   </P>
        <P>To date two major rounds of the Scheme have been advertised, in 2005/2006 and 2007, under which 45 substantive schemes were approved for funding.  Over the same period 54 community schemes were awarded pre-development grants.</P>
        <P>The funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated and the installation of a number of the projects grant aided is ongoing. No decision has been made in relation to the possible further extension of the Community Based CCTV Scheme.  However, any future plans for such an extension will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of funding, the progression of projects already grant aided and overall policy considerations.</P>

        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Clean-street was an initiative undertaken by the Garda National Drugs Unit, in conjunction with District and Divisional Garda Management, to target individuals involved in on-street sale and supply of drugs in communities.</P>
        <P>Over the past two years the Garda National Drugs Unit has coordinated eleven phases of Operation Clean-street across Garda Districts within the Dublin Metropolitan Region, Carlow, Limerick, Tullamore and most recently in Waterford. The operation has resulted in the arrest of over 400 persons and the detection of almost 750 offences of possession of drugs with intent to supply.</P>
        <P>While the particular information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost of the operation and the number of convictions arising is not readily to hand,  and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to compile, I am informed that many of the persons charged under the operation have been convicted, with a number of cases remaining before the Courts.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that certain phases of this initiative remain ongoing and that the targeting of the on-street sale, supply and distribution of drugs continues in conjunction with District and Divisional Officers.</P>
        <Col N="720" />
        <P>I can also assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to continuing to tackle the supply of drugs at all levels, in keeping with commitments contained in the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

        <P>A  total of 21 persons, subject to Deportation Orders issued following due process, were removed from Ireland and returned to Lagos, Nigeria on 7th March, 2012 in accordance with the law. The individuals in question were all failed asylum seekers or persons otherwise found to be in breach of their permission to be in the State.  A number of the deportees had been convicted of serious criminal offences for which they served prison sentences.  The returnees consisted of 7 adult males, 6 adult females and 8 minors.  The return was part of an operation led by Austria via Spain to Nigeria and organised through the EU FRONTEX network.</P>
        <P>Frontex <i>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language</i> (European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union) is the European Union agency for external border security. It is responsible for coordinating the activities of the national border guards in ensuring the security of the EU&rsquo;s borders with non-member states.</P>
        <P>Frontex was established by Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004. The agency became operational on 3 October 2005 and was the first EU agency to be based in one of the new EU states.</P>
        <P>Frontex&rsquo;s mission is to help EU Member States implement EU rules on external border controls   and to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the field of external border management. While it remains the task of each member state to control its own borders, the Agency is vested with the function to ensure that they all do so with the same high standard of efficiency.</P>
        <P>Frontex also assists EU Member States and Schengen-associated countries in the co-ordination of return flights. In the event that somebody is determined by a Member State government to be staying in that country illegally, they may be asked to leave. Many do so voluntarily, but those who do not may be returned to their country of origin by the Member State concerned. In these cases, it is Frontex&rsquo;s role to coordinate repatriation activities between those countries to ensure that humanitarian standards are met and to maximise efficiency and cost-effectiveness in joint return operations. Together with the experts from the Member States and refugee and asylum organisations, Frontex is also involved in identifying best practices in this area.</P>
        <P>Frontex is not a company in the manner implied by the Deputy and its operations in Ireland, as elsewhere in the EU, are subject to Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004.</P>

        <P>There is currently no provision in Irish Law allowing for the expunging of a conviction acquired by a person. The only exception to the general situation relates to Section 258 of the Children Act 2001, which provides for non-disclosure of certain findings of guilt made in relation to persons under 18 years of age. </P>
        <P>However, the Deputy may wish to note that drafting of a Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012, which is included on the priority &ldquo;A&rdquo; list  of Government legislation is almost complete and I expect to be in a position to publish it shortly. The Bill will allow former offenders to withhold details of certain qualifying convictions once certain conditions have been met and an appropriate conviction free period has been completed. Convictions for sexual offences and offences reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court (e.g. murder and rape) will be excluded from benefiting under the Bill, while persons applying for positions of employment involving the care of children and vulnerable adults will continue to have to disclose all past convictions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland which are registered with the garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to work with children and/or vulnerable adults.  The Garda vetting disclosures are issued to the registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. The primary purpose of the vetting scheme is the protection of children and vulnerable adults and that remains the priority.</P>

        <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) are ongoing with a full investigation team employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  I am further informed that there are currently 25 Garda personnel engaged in these investigations, comprising sixteen personnel at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, including fifteen Garda investigators and a forensic accountant, as well as nine members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded to ODCE.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na allocated to such investigations have previous experience in the investigation of fraud related offences, and the investigations are augmented by experienced investigators from ODCE.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities have indicated that to date two investigation files were submitted by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation to the Law Officers in December, 2010.  A supplemen<Col N="722" />tary file was submitted in May 2011 and a further investigation file was forwarded in October 2011.  The files remain under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and directions are awaited.  Following recent developments additional information has been submitted to the Law Officers to allow matters to be considered further. I am also informed that two persons have been arrested in relation to these investigations.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that no complaints have been received by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation in relation to the other financial institutions referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice.</P>
        <P>Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft, and seek Government approval to the introduction of, additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 2011, was enacted on 2 August.  The Act is an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle white collar crime.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  The Act&rsquo;s provisions are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime, and in particular on the experiences of those involved in the current investigations.  It provides new procedures and powers which will speed up both current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.</P>
        <P>This Government will continue to provide the necessary legislative and administrative supports for investigations within this jurisdiction.  I am being briefed on an ongoing basis on the progress of the investigations and am assured that this remains an absolute priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that there is sufficient personnel and technical expertise available to assist in the various aspects of this ongoing investigation.</P>

        <P>The daughter of the person concerned wrote to the Immigration Division of my Department on 7 October 2008 seeking, on behalf of her father, an extension of his permission to remain in the State.  Following consideration of this request, my Department decided that her father&rsquo;s circumstances did not warrant an extension of his C-Visit Visa period and this position was conveyed in writing to the daughter of the person concerned by letter dated 12 January 2009.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th February, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

        <P>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), that the person concerned submitted an application for EU Treaty Rights as the partner of an EU citizen, which was refused on 6th March 2012.

No evidence of a civil marriage ceremony having taken place in this country has been submitted to INIS to date. The applicant was given 15 working days from 6 March 2012 to seek a review of this decision, and no request for review has been received to date.</P>

        <P>The family leave entitlements that currently apply to parents or adoptive parents of a child are outlined in the Maternity Protection Acts 1998 and 2004, the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006 and the Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 and 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing proposals for legislation to transpose Council Directive 2010/18/EU of 8 March 2010 implementing the revised Framework Agreement on Parental Leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC and repealing Directive 96/34/EC.  The Bill will also consolidate the existing family leave Acts.  While I do not intend to provide for sharing of maternity and adoptive leave, as this would take from the existing entitlements of mothers, I should point out that parental leave under the Directive is being increased from 14 to 18 weeks and is available to both parents.  The feasibility of introducing further improvements in the family leave area will be considered as work on the Bill progresses.</P>

        <Quest> if it is possible to replace an old IRA medal that was lost in a house fire; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt>

        <P>The position is that the Department of Defence receives requests from time to time for the replacement of lost, stolen or destroyed medals awarded to Veterans of the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence.  In relation to such requests, it has been settled policy for many years that replacement medals were issued on a once-off only basis on receipt of a <i>bona fide</i> request from the veteran to whom the original medals were awarded. This policy was adopted in the interest of preserving the intrinsic value of the medals and to strictly limit the number of medals issued in any particular case.  Although all of the veterans are now deceased, the rationale for restricting the issue of replacement medals is still valid.  Apart from the intrinsic value of the medals, their monetary value on the open market is also a factor.</P>
        <P>However, in 2006, the then Minister for Defence decided that, where 1916 Rising/War of Independence medals had been lost, stolen or destroyed, official certificates, in both Irish and English, would be issued in such cases confirming that the relevant medal(s) was/were awarded to the named veteran.</P>
        <P>If a relative of the old IRA veteran in this case makes contact with the Pensions Administration Section of the Department in &Aacute;ras an tS&aacute;ile, Renmore, Galway (telephone 091 743899) and completes and returns to the Department the relevant application form, the details will be verified by the Department and, if in order, the relevant certificates will be issued.</P>

        <P>The pig sector remains the third largest component of the agri-food sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues. </P>
        <P>One of the main issues affecting the industry at present is the availability of credit.  This is an issue which predates recent banking difficulties and has long been a feature of the pig sector.  My Department is in regular contact with banking representatives and has encouraged them to discuss requirements with sectoral agri-food interests.  It is of course important that those seeking credit present a suitable business case with detailed cash flow projections.  In this context the Department also facilitated contacts between Teagasc and the banking sector to provide seminars and training in relation to credit application.  Any farming enterprises that feel they have not been treated fairly in relation to access to credit can contact the Credit Review Office, who will review their case.</P>
        <P>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently working on the establishment of a Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme for small business.  Primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the <i>de minimis </i>State Aid rules.</P>
        <P>I can assure you that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets set out in <i>Food Harvest 2020.</i></P>

        <P>Out wintering of cattle is governed by Cross Compliance (Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC).</P>
        <P>Under SMR4 (Nitrates) farmers who are stocked at less than 140kg of Nitrates per hectare (equivalent to 1.65 livestock units per hectare) can avail of the option to out winter some animals and thereby reduce the volume of storage required for animal manure provided that the out wintered animals are stocked at less than 1 livestock unit per hectare.  The total land area required to meet this requirement must be available to the animals at all times.</P>
        <P>The protection of soil structure and permanent pasture from damage by animals at any time of the year is a requirement under GAEC.  Therefore, animals out wintered in line with the Nitrates Regulation must not cause poaching or soil erosion.  Where conditions do not allow for out wintering through poaching or machinery use then farmers must have sufficient manure storage for the winter period.</P>

        <P>I understand the Teagasc Authority agreed a proposal to incorporate the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) into the Premium or Discussion Group package with a discount of &euro;95 for clients with less than 50 income units and &euro;75 for clients greater than 50 income units.  The BTAP participation fees are &euro;300 (less than 50 income units), &euro;345 (50 to 100 income units) and &euro;395 for farmers with greater than 100 income units.

        <P>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936, as amended, provides for the control of the spread of noxious weeds including Ragwort. Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of such noxious weeds.  The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction. </P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department actively seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act by issuing Notices to Destroy in all instances where it becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds.</P>
        <P>A total of 26 such Notices were issued in 2010 and a further 35 were issued in 2011.  These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by my Department or on receipt of complaints made by the public.</P>
        <P>Follow-up action may be undertaken by my Department with the land owner to ensure that the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the Notice to Destroy.</P>
        <P>Additionally, under the EU Single Farm Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross compliance measures of the scheme.  Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements.  In the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 penalties under the Single Payment were applied to 27, 31 and 46 farmers, respectively, for failure to take appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of noxious weeds.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to engage with local authorities and the National Roads Authority in relation to the treatment and disposal of noxious weeds on roadsides on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>My Department has also conducted a number of public awareness campaigns in recent years to raise awareness of noxious weeds and to promote best practice with regard to their control and elimination.</P>

        <P>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  Funding of some &euro;56.626m is available in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.</P>

The main objectives of the Youth Affairs area are to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.</P>
        <P>Support is provided to voluntary youth clubs through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and other such similar schemes which are administered by local Vocational Education Committees.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB) provides advice and support to local youth clubs through such a scheme.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 136 and 142 together.</P>
        <Col N="733" />
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) National Service Plan for 2012 provides for a reduction of 3.7% in funding to specialist disability services.  However, the Service Plan states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the ongoing work of the HSE&rsquo;s National Consultative Forum on disability services, the HSE in conjunction with representative organisations, service providers and service users, has begun a process to identify and agree a framework for identifying and implementing cost efficiencies. The goal is to minimise the impact on services. This work will be progressed through the National Consultative Forum.  In the interim, and in tandem with the work of the Forum and local discussions with individual agencies, agencies have had 3.7% reduced from their budget.  Some reductions in services will be unavoidable even with such efficiencies and will arise in day services, residential and respite services.</P>
        <P>The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including Personal Assistant services, to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant / home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with a physical and/or a sensory disability.  Although the funding allocated to disability services has decreased by 3.7%, the HSE aims to minimise the impact this will have on services users and their families as much as possible.  The HSE is in the process of negotiating with agencies providing personal assistant services around the unit cost of providing this service.  Personal assistance services are provided by agencies grant aided under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Staff in such agencies are not public servants and are not encompassed within the arrangement for determining pay rates or terms and conditions of employment, applying to public sector employees.</P>

        <P>Despite these challenges, the NAS has, over the past year, successfully put in place an intermediate care service in areas such as Limerick, Castleblayney and Galway and has developed plans to put a long term service in place in Mallow, Roscommon and Bantry.

        <P>In late 2009, the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) received a complaint from a member of the public in relation to the retention of Newborn Screening Cards (NSCs).  The basis of the complaint (which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner) was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. During 2010, <Col N="735" />a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the HSE, the DoH and CUH and Temple Street Hospital. A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the policy, from July 1st 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for 10 years and disposed of during the child&rsquo;s 11th year (for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary). Parents/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.  The changes to the NNBSP since 1st July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.</P>
        <P>The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years. Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012.  Having carefully considered the issue, I have accepted the recommendation of the review group, that in order to meet our legal and ethical responsibilities, newborn screening cards older than ten years will be destroyed.  The international consensus clearly favours seeking explicit consent (rather than opt out) from an individual and/or their parent/guardian for use of their previously collected biological material (including NCSs) for any other purpose than for which it was collected.</P>
        <P>The HSE is developing an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them, prior to any destruction of the cards taking place.</P>

        <P>The National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides pre-hospital emergency care and emergency and some non-emergency patient transport. </P>
        <P>Supported by my Department and by HIQA, the NAS is working to improve the management and integration of its services. This includes a reduction to two ambulance control centres nationally, with appropriate technology, a clinical lead for pre-hospital care, development and implementation of new performance indicators for pre-hospital care and development of standard national criteria in relation to non-emergency patient transport. In addition, a number of new service types are being introduced, such as the use of rapid response vehicles where required and intermediate care services, for dedicated stretcher-based transport without the requirement for the use of emergency resources.</P>
        <P>The NAS has undergone significant change in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money. In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards <Col N="736" />develop. I believe that these developments are in the best interests of patients, and that they are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s work to ensure high quality emergency care.</P>
        <P>NAS deploys resources on a dynamic basis to meet surges in demand and ensure spatial application of emergency cover. Resources in any given area can be supplemented by re-deploying available capacity from surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the HSE NAS that the Limerick Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) was put in place for a trial period of 25 weeks. The trial ends next week, and advanced life support delivery will continue on transfer from the single paramedic response in the RRV to delivery through the ambulance network. Advanced paramedics will continue to be deployed in emergency ambulances under the agreed National Ambulance Service National Framework Agreement Practitioner Deployment, which has been agreed with management and unions.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>The Special Delivery Unit (SDU) approved funding for the Louth Meath Hospital Group in October 2011 to facilitate the implementation of an improvement plan to manage the current Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding situation in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. This involved implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Acute <Col N="738" />Medicine Project 2010 and initiatives to increase the efficiency of the discharge process for patients thereby improving access to inpatient beds for admitted patients in the ED. This has enabled a number of service developments which include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> The establishment of an Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU) to streamline the management of medical patients who present to the ED for treatment. The AMAU opened in OLOL on 8 December 2012 and the hours of services are from Monday to Friday 08:00-24:00 hours. It is envisaged that this Unit will open at the weekends and will also provide a direct G.P. access referral service in the very near future as staff are recruited.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> An extension of the cardiac and respiratory diagnostic service which has increased the efficiency of the decision making process in regard to initiation of treatment and hence a decision regarding discharge or admission to hospital.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> Additional Bed Capacity: The medical bed capacity was increased by the opening of 8 additional medical beds that were developed as part of the Coronary Care capital development project.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> Additional Intermediate Care Beds in the Community: The contracting of 27 additional beds from community/private providers was also approved to allow additional delayed discharge patients to be moved to create immediate acute bed capacity in OLOL. These beds continue to be utilised.oo</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> Additional assisted Discharge Service: A number of assisted discharge services were also approved and continue to expedite the discharge of patients who require any or a combination of these services in order to be discharged from hospital. These include funding for the provision of home IVs  for patients who can be discharged and continue to receive antibiotics intravenously while at home.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> 1,126 additional home care/help packages and funding for additional aids and appliances has also been made available to assist and expedite the discharge process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Phase two of the SDU&rsquo;s initiatives to manage the current ED overcrowding involves improving the care pathway for management of elderly patients in both the community and in hospital. The Louth Meath Integrated Service Area were invited to submit a proposal with focused initiatives which will reduce the risks of avoidable admissions to hospital facilitating timely discharge and minimising premature dependence on long term care.</P>
        <P>The SDU will continue to work with the NTPF, the HSE Clinical Programmes and hospitals to minimise patient waiting times in emergency departments and reduce waiting periods for in patient and day case elective surgical care.</P>

        <P>I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland are in advanced negotiations regarding the best possible future use and promotion of the Fry Model Railway and hope that the matter will be concluded over the coming weeks.  Any final agreement reached will be in keeping with the terms of the covenant which originally bestowed it to the State and will involve the model railway being available for the public to view in its entirety.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to reply to the Deputy on this matter.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply in ten working days.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> if there is a legal basis for the operation of the private car clamping sector; and the charges it extorts from private motorists. </Quest>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
        <P>At present there is no legislation regulating the operation of private clamping operators.  The current laws only provide for clamping by local authorities, or those acting as their agents, on public roads and in local authority car parks.  This leaves unregulated the whole area of clamping on private property.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to regulate the vehicle clamping industry, I presented a discussion document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht in December 2011 in which I outlined the issues which I feel need to be addressed in regulating the industry, my proposals on the shape of appropriate legislation and inviting their views.  I understand that the Committee has consulted with a number of relevant stakeholders in the matter and is due to report back to me shortly.</P>
        <P>When the Committee&rsquo;s response had been received, I will submit draft legislation to the Government for approval and I hope to be in a position to bring a Bill before the Oireachtas this year.</P>

        <Quest> if it is intended to provide a coast guard station in west Connemara in the Cleggan area; the progress made with such a project; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>The Cleggan Volunteer Coast Guard Unit, which is designated as a shoreline search unit, is currently operating out of an old Coast Guard station, sometimes called the Rocket House.  It is one of a number of Coast Guard Units around the coast operating from Rocket Houses that have been identified for upgrade.</P>
        <P>Funds are not available for the Cleggan upgrade in the current capital envelope as the building projects at Killybegs, Doolin and Greystones will take priority.  Additionally the current site of the Unit has been deemed unsuitable for an upgrade project and a new location will need to be identified locally by the OPW.</P>
