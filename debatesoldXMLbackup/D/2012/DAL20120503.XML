      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that the documentary aired by the BBC last Tuesday night about how the Catholic Church had dealt with child abuse in 1975 was another shocking chapter in a sad litany of which we are only too well aware from reading reports such as the Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports.  He will also agree that the church&rsquo;s inaction on that occasion led to many more vulnerable, defenceless people being abused.  I suggest everybody in the House will agree that every citizen has now and always had at least a moral obligation to report any abuse to the civil authorities.  The Taoiseach said in a speech to the House, presumably with the agreement of the Government, last July in the wake of the Cloyne report, &ldquo;Today the Catholic Church needs to be a penitent church.  A church truly and deeply penitent for the horrors it perpetrated, hid and denied.&rdquo;  In the light of that comment and the revelations made in the BBC documentary, what is the Government&rsquo;s position or does it have one on the standing and future of Cardinal Brady, head of the Catholic Church in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that what we saw and what was reported in the documentary was another horrific episode in the failure of senior figures in the Catholic Church to protect children and report the abuse and rape of children.  The rape or abuse of a child is a crime, and it was a crime then.  The place for crimes to be investigated, prosecuted and dealt with is in the courts, and by garda&iacute;.  I do not believe there is a parallel system of law which deals with these matters.  Anybody who has or had knowledge about the rape or abuse of a child has or had a duty to report it to the authorities.  Whatever may be said about it occurring in 1975, whatever number of years ago and in whatever context, there have been plenty of opportunities since for the information on the abuse and rape of those children to be brought to the attention of the Garda and the matters which were known to be reported, not least when the case of Fr. Brendan Smyth who was at the centre of it came to public attention.  The Deputy will recall, as far as the political response to the issue at the time was concerned, that that particular episode caused the collapse of a Government and the establishment of a new one.</P>
        <P>As far as the Government is concerned, we are putting in place much stronger rules and regulations in respect of responsibility to children.  The draft children first Bill, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs last week, will place a statutory obligation on organisations and named individuals to report information on abuse or significant neglect to the HSE, whether it occurs in the organisation or elsewhere.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect the child about whom there is a concern and protect other children in the community from an abuser who may be abusing multiple children.  The legislation will require a priest, as a pastoral member of a religious organisation, to report concerns about abuse directly to the HSE.  In addition, the Minister for Justice and Equality has published legislation which provides for the withholding of information on sexual abuse to be deemed a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>As far as the Deputy&rsquo;s questions about Cardinal Brady are concerned, I have always believed in the separation of church and State.  It is the job of the Government and the State to enact our laws and ensure they apply to everybody, whether they belong to a church or not, but it is my own personal view that anybody who did not deal with the scale of the abuse we have seen in this case should not hold a position of authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his comprehensive reply.  I am aware of the legislation to which he referred.  I welcome it and look forward to it being brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s forthright reply contrasts starkly with the reaction of the Taoiseach when he was asked about this issue yesterday evening.  He made a speech in the House last July which was widely lauded from one end of the country to the other.  Epithets such as &ldquo;brave&rdquo;, &ldquo;courageous&rdquo;, &ldquo;forward thinking&rdquo;, etc., filled the airwaves, yet when presented with a concrete example &mdash; it is easy to look brave in the abstract &mdash; and asked what his position was, he refused to take the same position the T&aacute;naiste has clearly taken this morning.  I take it that the position the T&aacute;naiste stated is his personal position and, presumably, that of his party, that it is not a Government position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me deal with this issue very directly.  Let there be no doubt in anybody&rsquo;s mind about where the Taoiseach stands on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is just a straight question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekKeating"><NameTxt>Deputy Derek Keating</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is twisting this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea should not attempt to turn what is a very serious issue into some kind of political whack at the Taoiseach.  People up and down the country are rightly horrified about what happened and the failure to report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>People are worried about the contrast in the Government&rsquo;s position between last July and now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>He was the first Taoiseach to come into the House to address in the most forthright and direct way where responsibility lay and where the responsibility of church authorities lay.  Everybody who has heard him knows exactly where he stands on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position is the same as the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The criticism may be made that one can come into the House and make a speech and so on.  The proof of the pudding is what we have done as a Government and the follow-up we have given to the Cloyne report.  After 14 years when, to be honest, not a great deal was happening in this area, we have produced the first legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government appointed the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the history of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We have produced the legislation which will underpin the Children First guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>He was very brave last July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation is hugely robust and is before a committee of the Houses at present.  In addition, because there has been this ambiguity about what happens where things are not reported, whether they can be reported, or whether there is some kind of a parallel system of justice that operates somewhere under some other system of law, whether it is called canon law or whatever, and that somehow that can be dealt with separately, we have made it very clear in the legislation which the Minister for Justice and Equality has brought forward that the withholding of information about sex abuse or about the abuse of children will not be acceptable and will itself be an offence.  Let there be absolutely no doubt about where the Government stands, where the Taoiseach stands and where every member of the Government stands in regard to this horrific abuse.</P>

	<P>Do you mind, Minister?  The rules apply to you as to any other Member.  I will be asking you to leave the House if you are not careful.  The rules apply to everybody equally in this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome most sincerely the clarity and the forthrightness of the response of the T&aacute;naiste.  This is a matter I would like to return to today under promised legislation but I warmly welcome and acknowledge his response and, most particularly, the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in the area of child protection.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party colleague, Senator Gilroy, highlighted the fact Senators earn &euro;27,000 less than TDs.  I am not sure whether he was calling for a reduction in the salary of TDs or an increase in Senators&rsquo; pay &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste might explain.  What is the Labour Party&rsquo;s position on pay for politicians and special advisers?  I believe, given the real suffering of people, this issue needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s live register figures show 436,000 people were without a job, and I have no doubt this figure is kept low because of the huge level of emigration.  People are actively looking for work to pay their bills and look after their families, yet they still see their politicians, the political class, enjoying lavish salaries and perks of office.  At a time when the Government is planning to impose water charges and other charges on hard-pressed households, for the benefit in particular of our Labour colleagues, I point out that Mr. Conor Murphy MP, the former Sinn F&eacute;in Minister who stopped water charges in the North of Ireland, is in Leinster House and you might want to talk to him later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I can do better than that.  I can tell Sinn F&eacute;in what the Government has already done.  The very first decision the Government took was to cut the pay of politicians.  We cut the pay of the Taoiseach, of every Minister in the Government and of TDs.  What TDs and Senators are paid in this D&aacute;il is considerably less than what they had been paid in the previous D&aacute;il.  We also cut the payments which attach to ministerial transport, for example, which are down by 65%.  We also cut, or at least attempted to cut, the level of expenses that were paid to TDs.  Mind you, when I looked at the league table of the expenses claimed by Members of the House, I noticed that the expenses claimed by members of Sinn F&eacute;in are at the top end of the league table, so Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Those claims, of course, do not include the rather extravagant claim of ink cartridges that was claimed by Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not see that one coming.  What about the dodgy fivers?</P>

	<P>Inkgate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Seanad, the Government is proposing the constitutional amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>To reduce the bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on which we intend to have a referendum under which it is proposed to abolish the Seanad.  Deputy McDonald may indicate to the House in her reply where she stands on that question.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of employment, the Government is very focused on getting investment and employment into this country.  We have, over recent weeks, had a considerable amount of success in this area.  The Deputy will, I am sure, be aware of the announcements of jobs: PayPal &mdash; 1,000 jobs in Louth; Apple &mdash; 500 jobs in Cork; Cisco &mdash; 115 jobs in Galway; Ely Lilly &mdash; 500 jobs in Cork South-West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course, we intend to continue with that work to get the level of unemployment down and to get people back into employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The short of it, then, is that the T&aacute;naiste is defending the current pay rates of politicians.  He thinks that, at a time of crisis, it is appropriate the Taoiseach takes home &euro;200,000.  He defends his own pay of &euro;184,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is ink on your face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>What message are we sending to the people who are out of work or the lone parents who were so brutally dealt with in the recent social welfare legislation?  Are we saying to them, or is the T&aacute;naiste saying to them: too bad, things are tough, suck up the austerity, but we are okay, Jack?  It strikes me that is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s message.  His own pay doubled in the last year when he moved from the Opposition benches into his Government position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It defies all logic and rationality that they, the champions of austerity, the champions of cutbacks, defend these pay rates that cannot be justified and yet say to the public, to people who are struggling, that they have to take more and more hardship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not take home &euro;200,000.  There is a difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is his salary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a difference between gross pay and take home pay.  Let us be clear about it.  This Government has cut the take home pay of people at senior level in politics by approximately 44%.  That is the total cut in take home pay.  There is a limit to the amount of hypocrisy we can take from the Sinn F&eacute;in party on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no limit to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s hypocrisy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That party sees nothing wrong with having its members take a salary from a parliament they do not attend at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>I understood there were only republicans in the Chamber these days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>They take considerable expenses from a parliament they do not attend.  The Sinn F&eacute;in party is at the top end of the expenses claimed by Members.  Anyone can examine the league tables because they have all been published.  One finds consistently that Sinn F&eacute;in is at the top end of those claims.  Interestingly, its representatives are at the top end in most constituencies when compared with constituency colleagues who, presumably, would have the same level of travel expenses and so on.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Machiavellian descriptive narrative and deceptive adjectives abound from the Government this week, with words such as &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; creating illusions of doomsday scenarios every time the fiscal compact treaty is mentioned.  Doubt over future funding is the stick the Government is using to beat the people into submission by 31 May.  Surely lessons should have been learned by this stage about the aftermath of signing treaties when ambiguities abound.  What a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive.</P>

	<P>As this drama plays out like a Shakespearian tragedy, albeit one poorly scripted, the Government banshee keens on: &ldquo;There will be no foreign direct investment.&rdquo;  It is a case of Angela&rsquo;s Ashes part two: the treaty sequel.  The scenarios of Armageddon being peddled are truly staggering.  If the European Financial Stability Facility funding will not be made available to the country, why did the European Heads of State declare on 30 March that any member state in a programme will be funded up to the point where they can return to the markets?</P>

	<P>There is no ambiguity and I am happy to answer the question directly.  The position is that the programme Ireland is in, the EU-IMF-ECB programme, the programme with the troika, will remain in place.  It will continue and will be honoured until it expires at the end of 2013.  It is the Government&rsquo;s hope and intention that by that stage we will be back in the markets and we will be able to say goodbye to the troika and fund our State in the normal way by access to the markets.</P>

	<P>Then the Government will welcome in the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Payments from the European financial stability facility, EFSF, will continue to be honoured up to that point.  The European Stability Mechanism, the permanent emergency fund for the euro, will come into effect once 90% of the capital has been provided for it.  It is due to come into effect in July 2012.  After the end of our programme, the only emergency funding available to the country will be from the ESM.  The EFSF will not take new applications for funding.  For us to have access to the ESM we are required to ratify the treaty because the ESM will only be available to states that ratify the treaty.</P>

	<P>All commentators and economists throughout the world seem adamant we will require the second bailout programme.  Options are available to the Government.  The EFSF is one option.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to explain to the House why chapter 1.4 of the articles of association of the EFSF states that financing granted prior to such dates may have scheduled maturities falling after such dates and disbursements thereunder may occur.  The option is open to the Government to make a decision in 2013 and to apply to the EFSF for roll-over funding or a new programme.  This will ensure our funding in future.  That option is open to the Government.  Why does the Government not consider it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that option is not open to us.  Let us be absolutely clear about it: it is clear in the treaty that the EFSF is prepared to continue funding that is already committed to under the existing programme.  That programme finishes at the end of 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s intention is that we will be back in the markets at that stage.  To get back in to the markets we must get our economy to recover, to grow and so on.  This is why the inward investment I referred to earlier and the various jobs announcements and so on are important.  We are confident we will be able to continue to attract such investment provided there is continued investor confidence in the country.</P>

	<P>The position is that our intention is to be back in the markets, and to do that we must continue the investment.</P>
        <P>That continued investment is dependent on there being a stable euro, which is the reason it is necessary for us to ratify this treaty.

	<P>I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about legislation which is of great interest to people outside the rarefied atmosphere of this House, namely, the insolvency Bill.  The Taosieach was asked about that last week and he stated there was a good deal of complexity around it, which I accept.  He stated further that he was pushing hard to get the Bill finalised, and I accept that.  I ask, on behalf of my constituents and tens of thousands of other people outside this House, the stage we are at now.  Have the complexities been overcome?  Have the differences been resolved?  When is the Bill due to be published?  Is the T&aacute;naiste also aware that considerable administrative machinery will need to be put in place to make this Bill operable?  Between publication and putting in place the system to make the Bill operable, when will the Bill be operating?  That is a question my constituents, more of whom are falling into mortgage arrears on a daily basis, ask me constantly and it is on their behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of many other Deputies that I ask the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s intention is that the personal insolvency Bill will be published this session.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Dea acknowledged, it is complex legislation.  We are dealing with a new approach to the issue of personal insolvency and radical changes in the period of time involved but also the introduction of various non-judicial settlement approaches for dealing with debt, and those are complex, new and radical approaches.  I am sure Deputy O&rsquo;Dea will appreciate that some time has to be taken to ensure we get it right but we are anxious to move it ahead as quickly as possible.  It is on the A list and it is intended to be published this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the point but can the T&aacute;naiste give us any idea when the Bill will be in operation?  It is not just a question of publishing and passing the legislation here in the House.  A system will have to be put in place to make the Bill operable in practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that, and the practical arrangements have to be addressed, but we must have some certainty about what will be in operation before we can start putting in place those practical arrangements.  That will be examined once the issues relating to the content of the Bill have been resolved.</P>

	<P>In the past 48 hours we have collectively revisited the horror of the rape, abuse and molestation of children and its cover-up in a way that I am sure has proven incredibly difficult for victims of abuse, whether they suffered it at the hands of clerics or anyone else.  In that light, I welcome that the heads of the Children First Bill have been published and are in committee and the legislation on the withholding of information.  In terms of the third piece of the puzzle, the child and family support agency Bill, when can we expect to see that?  As we are speaking here today, it is incredibly important that we move collectively in a constructive way on this matter.  The T&aacute;naiste correctly stated earlier that this issue, above all issues, cannot be a political football.  As legislators, the best we can do for victims of child abuse and for all of our children is to make sure we move speedily on all of these legislative matters.  Specifically, I ask about the child and family support agency Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that this is an issue, and everybody in the country would agree, which has to be given priority attention in the D&aacute;il.  That is what the Government is doing.  I note, however, the Deputy did not give it priority attention in selecting the topic she chose for Leaders&rsquo; Questions but that is her call.</P>
        <P>With regard to the items of legislation, Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill will start in the Seanad next week.

Will he also indicate if there will be protection for deposits in that legislation for people renting apartments, mainly in urban areas?  That was a huge problem previously with students but the people coming to work in what has been tagged &ldquo;Silicon Dock&rdquo; are discovering that when they try to move on they cannot get their deposits back.

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce legislation to protect small building subcontractors who have been denied payments from larger companies.  In this regard, I have been working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Construction Contracts Bill as robust legislation.</P>
        <P>I regard this legislation as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill which is unique for two reasons.  First, all Stages were passed by the previous Seanad and it has now come before the D&aacute;il.  Second, although significantly amended from the original Bill, the legislation is most definitely the product of a bipartisan approach.  It would not be where it is were it not for the diligence and initiative of Senator Feargal Quinn.  I very much hope the spirit of co-operation the Senator and I have shown on this Bill will be extended in this House.</P>
        <P>Construction is a very important sector of the national economy.  It is widely acknowledged that well managed and successfully delivered construction projects can improve the delivery of public and private services.  However, the economic downturn in the construction sector has highlighted the lack of formal contractual arrangements and bad payment practices in the sector.  While there is strong anecdotal evidence of the practice of delayed or non-payment having escalated in recent times, it should be noted that the problem is not new.  It is reported that many firms, mainly subcontractors, are experiencing serious difficulty in obtaining payment for work done.  It is, therefore, important that, where possible, payment transactions within the sector should be facilitated to ensure prompt payment of the correct amount.</P>
        <P>Apart from a small number of formal standard forms of contracts and conditions of engagement, the current arrangements for construction contracts and conditions of engagement are much too imprecise and informal.  As a result, they do not offer a cost effective, timely solution for consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in the supply chain.  The Bill before the House seeks to address the issue of non-payment to construction sector contractors, subcontractors and subcontractors of subcontractors who have completed work to the required standard on construction projects.  The Bill will address these issues by providing statutory arrangements for payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments, thus reducing a payee&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment, and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not purport to provide a response to all of the causes or manifestations of non-payment in the construction sector.  This is a complex area and a comprehensive response to all of the causes of non-payment in the sector will not be provided in a single Bill.  In particular, it is important to realise that many of the non-payment difficulties are linked to business failures and this Bill will not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation and receivership or prompt payment regulations.</P>
        <P>In setting out the main provisions of the Bill, I am mindful that the Bill that passed the remaining Stages in the Seanad was not as complete as it could have been.  In this regard, I sought a regulatory impact assessment of the Bill to give me the opportunity to examine the issue from first principles as the Bill introduces new rights, obligations and systems which will affect contracts and impose new regulatory requirements between clients, contractors and subcontractors across a broad sweep of construction operations in the State.  In this regard, I will shortly set out the main findings of the regulatory impact assessment and give an indication as to the areas of the legislation that will be subject to amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, I propose to set out the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with interpretations and is standard.  Section 2 concerns the scope and application of the Bill.  It excludes certain contracts from the definition of &ldquo;construction contract&rdquo; and ensures the Bill will not apply to contracts below certain value thresholds.  It also ensures that, in the normal course, the Bill will not apply to an ordinary individual who enters a contract for the building, extension or renovation of his or her home.  He or she will not be required to comply with the new rules set out in the Bill.  However, the section also tries to ensure that contracts concerning so-called &ldquo;trophy homes&rdquo; come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 3 sets out the rules to govern payments under construction contracts.  All construction contracts will have to provide clearly for the amount and timing of payments.  If a contract fails to specify these matters, the terms set out in the Schedule will apply.  This section also ensures that &ldquo;pay when paid&rdquo; clauses, as they are known, will no longer be acceptable in contracts.  This means, for example, that subcontractors or subcontractors of subcontractors will no longer be dependent on a main contractor being paid before they are entitled to receive their payments.  This is a significant change.</P>
        <P>Section 4 details the arrangements for a party to claim payments under a construction contract.  It sets out detailed procedures for making a payment claim.  In the event that the amount involved is disputed between the parties, this section works to ensure each of the parties is clear about the amount in dispute and the basis on which the dispute arises.  This provides an important clarification which is not readily available to contracting parties.  It then forms the basis for seeking a resolution of a payment dispute, through moving on to the adjudication process provided under the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 5 confers a new statutory right for contracting parties.  A party who has not been fully paid &mdash; in accordance with the contract and the terms of the Bill &mdash; will have the right to suspend work under the contract for a period of up to two weeks.  The section sets out the rules under which the suspension of work can occur.  This provision was developed to help to rebalance the power between contracting parties, without unduly hampering the completion of a project.  The existence of the right should help to ensure payments are made on time.  Where a payment claim is still unpaid following the period of suspension, the appropriate path is for the parties to move on to an adjudication and seek resolution of the matter through that process.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 to 9, inclusive, are related.  They provide for a new process for the adjudication of payment disputes and set out arrangements for this new process.  This is a critical aspect of the Bill and creates an important mechanism by which unpaid parties to construction contracts can have a relatively quick and cost-effective resolution of their payment disputes.  Therefore, these sections deal with the right to refer payment disputes to adjudication; the right to suspend work for failure to comply with an adjudicator&rsquo;s decision; the selection of a panel of adjudicators; and the code of practice for adjudication.</P>
        <P>Section 6 makes provision for a new system of adjudication.  It gives contracting parties the right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication and sets out the arrangements to be followed.  Importantly, it ensures a construction contract cannot be drafted so as to try to negate or reduce this right to adjudication.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that if an adjudicator&rsquo;s award is not paid in full within seven days of the adjudication decision, the unpaid party has a right to suspend work under the construction contract.  It sets out the rules governing this arrangement.</P>
        <P>Section 8 sets out arrangements for the creation of a panel from which an adjudicator can be appointed to deal with a payment dispute.  Section 9 gives the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the power to prepare and publish a code of practice to govern the conduct of adjudications.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides that parties to the contract may agree on a method to deliver notices referred to in the Bill.  In the event that they do not agree, the Bill allows for delivery by a postal service provider.  This is a common feature of legislation that provides for the delivery of notices.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for the Short Title and commencement arrangements for the Bill.  It provides that it may be cited as the Construction Contracts Act 2012 and that it will come in effect on such day as the Minister may by order appoint.</P>
        <P>The Schedule to the Bill works together with section 3.  The Schedule sets out default arrangements for contract payment terms.  These will be minimum standards for subcontracts.  This is a major innovation which should especially help sub-contractors.</P>
        <P>In order to address the concerns raised about the current draft of the Bill, Senator Feargal Quinn and I arranged to meet stakeholders in the construction sector on 28 June 2011 to discuss the Bill.  I also recognise the very helpful contributions of the main Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Sean Fleming and Mary Lou McDonald, on the regulatory impact assessment that took place on that occasion.  I was delighted that they were able to join that discussion with the industry and make observations accordingly.  This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration.  These have been taken into account in the regulatory impact assessment of the Bill, which was completed late last year and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  It was published once we received it.  That is important because we gave a commitment in the programme for Government to publish regulatory impact statements.  It was a small part of the programme for Government, but it has now happened and is an important change to how legislation is formed.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact statement examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention.  It found that there were problems with construction contracts.  The two main issues are as follows.  The majority of construction contracts are carried out on an informal basis, with no written contract in place.  That is typical, as we all know from experience in our constituencies.  There are no minimum standards for payments and their timing.  The sector is small, which means that where there is a contract, the bulk of the power rests with the main contractor.  In cases where work is carried out on an informal basis, the subcontractor has no way of securing payment where there is a dispute.  In the minority of cases where formal contracts are in place, the route to resolving such disputes &mdash; arbitration or the courts &mdash; is costly and time consuming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the regulatory impact assessment examined the main proposals to amend the Bill raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation.  It found that there were merits to considering amending the Bill in a number of respects.  I would like to go through these ideas and suggest how we might deal with them.  On the question of thresholds, private contracts below &euro;200,000 and public contracts below &euro;50,000 do not come within the scope of the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  The regulatory impact assessment examined the UK experience of adjudication, where the system has been up and running for some years, which showed that the majority of disputes in which the parties used such processes concerned contracts valued between &pound;10,000 and &pound;50,000.  Therefore, it was concluded that these thresholds were too high and should be reviewed or removed.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that an adjudication award is binding, except where either party refers the case to arbitration or the courts.  A key consideration in developing proposals is the need to strike a balance between ensuring the efficient operation of the construction sector in Ireland, both in terms of cash flow and the resolution of payment disputes, and the safeguarding of public moneys.  The State is one of the biggest purchasers of construction contracts.  The regulatory impact assessment found that as the Bill was drafted, the balance would appear to favour the payer.  To resolve this issue, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are developing a number of options aimed at making adjudication binding for both public and private sector contracts, while at the same time protecting the taxpayer.  We have to get the balance right.</P>
        <P>The regulatory impact assessment found that the inclusion of all suppliers would significantly broaden the scope of the Bill, as supplies make up a significant proportion of a construction contract; thus the arrangements to include numerous suppliers could create an unduly onerous process, which could create a barrier to entry for smaller enterprises.  It concluded that supplies made specifically for a contract &mdash; bespoke supplies &mdash; could be included in the legislation, but it recognised that it might be difficult to interpret what was or was not bespoke.  To summarise, it concluded that the best option was to proceed with the Bill, but to amend it to bring lower value contracts and bespoke supplies within its scope and to make the adjudicator&rsquo;s award binding.  In general, it concluded that any such amendments should be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>There was intense interest on both sides of the House to discuss this matter.  In fairness to Deputies, there has been correct lobbying to make sure we get the Bill through.  I am now asking Members to put it through Second Stage, but I will indicate the matters on which I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage in the light of the conclusions of the regulatory impact assessment.  Since publication of the regulatory impact assessment, I have had the opportunity to develop proposals aimed at resolving these and other issues.  While I am not proposing amendments today, I signal to the House my intention to bring forward specific Committee Stage amendments to deal with the following issues.  First, in order to ensure the legislation applies to a majority of construction contracts, it is my intention to bring forward amendments to broaden its scope by reducing or removing altogether the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill.  Second, having examined similar legislation in other jurisdictions, I can see the merit of broadening the scope of the legislation to include bespoke construction supply contracts.  I stress that it will be difficult to define what is meant by bespoke supplies, but I will attempt to do so on Committee Stage.  Third, making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is complex.  We have to get the balance right between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions and ensuring its application is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.  Fourth, the two week time limit preventing contractors from withdrawing services in the event of non-payment where work has been carried out to a satisfactory standard seems insufficient and, therefore, will need to be amended.</P>
        <P>I am aware of a number of other technical issues raised in relation to the Bill.  These are being examined and, where necessary, amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage.  Given Members&rsquo; substantial interest in the Bill, I will keep an open mind regarding issues they may wish to flag at this stage for consideration on Committee Stage.  This is not my Bill; it is Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s and I am strongly of the opinion that we must take a bipartisan approach to it.  It is essential that the solution to this issue is balanced so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.  I am very grateful to Senator Feargal Quinn for his commitment to the legislation and look forward to working closely with him to ensure we develop robust legislation to tackle the issue.  I will, of course, give consideration to constructive suggestions made on Second and subsequent Stages.</P>

	<P>I welcome the arrival in the House of the Construction Contracts Bill 2011.  I join the Minister of State in paying tribute to Senator Feargal Quinn for the huge amount of work he has done, with Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher.  As a Minister of State, I had the privilege of bringing the Bill through the Seanad.  If I can express one concern, it is about the length of time it has taken to bring the Bill to this stage.  In the meantime, many sub-suppliers have gone under because of the environment in which we are operating or the lack of protection available.  However, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for being open with every Member of the House about the work being done on the Bill.  Can we aspire to seeing it pass through the Houses before the summer recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a Deputy in the House who has not spoken to a subcontractor in difficulty.  The worst thing of all is when a subcontractor is let down on a State contract, whether with the HSE, a local authority or third level institution, that he or she thought was gold plated.  If the Bill can be enacted before the summer recess, we will have done some service.</P>
        <P>I cite examples of why the legislation is necessary and would like to move away from technical language what happens in to real life.  Like all Deputies, I know of large household name contractors which have gone under in the course of carrying out a contract.  We must stand back from the legislation and ask questions about procurement law and tendering processes that have encouraged the submission of the lowest price contracts and poor examination of what makes up a tender.  In some cases, there was a poor assessment of a company&rsquo;s ability to deliver on a contract.  The practice of using turnover thresholds, excluding companies under a certain level of turnover from applying for certain contracts, is also flawed.  A contractor might have a large turnover from building large numbers of houses but be incapable of building a school or completing a large-scale engineering project.  When the job has been done, the Minister of State might take a look at the issue of procurement which is, rightly, linked with a jobs strategy.  We must ask ourselves if we are getting the best bang for our buck, in terms of what the Government is spending on job creation measures.</P>
        <P>On my desk I have the case of a sub-contractor who started work on a health care facility.  The main contractor went under and the subcontractor was left &euro;150,000 short.  He does not have that money.  The promoters of the project went back to the HSE which retendered and the project is under way again.  However, my constituent is still short his &euro;150,000.  He can hardly afford to buy the newspaper to see the project advertised, much less have the capacity to resubmit a tender.  Another subcontractor is putting seating into a local authority theatre.  The main contractor went under, having been paid by the local authority, but the carpenter was not paid.  He was able to take that hit and started a second project.  However, another main contractor went under, again on a local authority project, and the carpenter could take a second hit.  Six workers were laid off and talented people whose skills we need have left the country.  One assumes Government contracts are gold plated and have an insurance policy built in.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 to 9, inclusive, of the Bill are crucial.  The danger lies in informality in the sector and the &ldquo;D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i&rdquo; way of doing business.  I hope the experiences of subcontractors in the last three or four years will get rid of that informality forever.   It has led small contractors to depend on big names which never let them down but did not put anything in writing.  If we implement the Bill, a health warning must be issued with it to the effect that these sections are being included because of people&rsquo;s experiences.  Whatever the practices were, the language of the Bill must formalise the practices that may have served us previously.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is particularly welcome.  It strikes me as odd that subcontractors allowed amounts of money to build up.  For example, &euro;150,000 is a huge amount of money.  In that case, the subcontractor probably thought &ldquo;it would never happen to me&rdquo;.  It is a huge amount of money to which to be exposed on a relatively small contract.  The practice of &ldquo;pay when paid&rdquo; must be got rid of and the change must be enforced.  Who will enforce the measures included in the Bill?  We can make legislation, but enforcement and breaking what has been a culture for decades in the construction industry will be a bigger job.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to address amendments on Committee Stage is fair.  I also acknowledge the contribution of his party colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, who spoke strongly in the Seanad, particularly on the issue of thresholds.  It is probably not possible to include every contract in the legislation, but the thresholds prescribed in the Bill are too high.  Given the current cost of construction, contracts are now 40% or 50% lower than they were six or seven years ago, which is to be welcomed, but the thresholds envisaged in the legislation need to be changed to reflect this.</P>
        <P>The question of supplies is complex.  It is easy to go into a theatre and take out seats, but one cannot take out concrete.  The Irish Concrete Federation has come up with an interesting definition and referred to suppliers of construction products and materials that are &ldquo;irretrievable due to their incorporation in the structure of the building&rdquo;.  That would cover much ground work, concrete and bricks that cannot be taken away as one can take away other things from projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like divorce law.  It is irretrievable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes, indeed.  The Minister of State and his officials might give some consideration to that definition.  It is narrow enough not to cause problems in the legislation the Minister of State envisages.  I wonder whether the legislation is too late.  I worry that the horse has bolted.  The construction industry is, in effect, at a standstill.  One hopes that when it comes back to some sort of normal level this protection will be in place.  I do not suspect there is any possibility, given the lack of resources, of some sort of compensation fund for those companies that have been stung in recent years.  Many genuine people have been stung.  In the briefing notes to the legislation reference is made to bonds, insurance policies and suchlike, but unfortunately, they were not in place.  Insurance is something one wishes one had on a rainy day, but one did not.  Many good people have struggled to keep their businesses afloat.  These are people who genuinely thought that because the HSE or local authority, for example, was responsible for a building they would pay the bills and that everything would be grand.  The local authority or HSE discharges responsibility to the main contractor, but unfortunately the food chain down the line did not see any benefit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, indicated, it is a tribute to Senator Feargal Quinn in particular that he has stuck with the Bill.  He has done a lot of work on it.  It would be beneficial if we could aspire not to go into another session with this work unfinished.  I understand that many speakers will wish to contribute on Second Stage but there is no reason the Bill should not go through Committee Stage quickly.  I suspect the Bill will have to go back to the Seanad.  If we could complete it between now and the middle of July we will have done some sort of service to those who are very badly exposed in the construction sector at the moment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is long awaited and desperately needed.  I commend the Minister on the constructive engagement he has had with stakeholders and the Opposition in recent months.  The Bill has the support of the entire construction sector, from house builders to general contractors, civil engineers, mechanical and electrical contractors, architects, building suppliers and the construction sector.  It is now time for the Government and all of us to bring the Bill to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, outlined, Senator Feargal Quinn must be heartily commended on introducing this legislation in response to the desperate financial fall-out for subcontractors unable to secure payment for work completed.  I do not wish to sound a dissonant note but I will do so anyway, it is to the previous Government&rsquo;s shame that big contractors and developers were glad-handed and small subcontractors have been failed so spectacularly during the previous Administration&rsquo;s time in office.</P>
        <P>Part of the impetus around the campaigning work for the legislation is that it became apparent that big developers and contractors had more cushioning and protection at their disposal to protect themselves and their personal wealth, enabling them to continue in business or to pursue new ventures while small subcontractors were literally hung out to dry.  The impact of that has proven devastating for many.  Small businesses are left crippled by insurmountable debt arising is some instances solely from moneys owed to them by developers.  I will follow Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s example and cite a real-life example of the challenges facing small subcontractors in the absence of the legislation we required to tackle non-payment.</P>
        <P>The example to which I refer is not from my own neck of the woods.  It relates to GG Roofing &mdash; a Mayo-based subcontractor &mdash; which successfully completed work for Westport Property and Construction on the Silverbridge shopping centre in Claremorris in July 2009 and invoiced the main contractor the balance of the moneys owed to the company of just over &euro;29,000.  Westport Property made a few small erratic payments from November 2009 to June 2010.  After a protracted legal dispute the courts ruled in favour of GG Roofing in April 2011, yet one year later the company has still not been paid.  The money owed to the subcontractor is clearly of little or no concern to Westport Property but for GG Roofing getting paid will keep the lights on &mdash; if not it could be left with no option but to shut up shop.</P>
        <P>I wish to address some of the dilemmas and shortfalls in the Bill as currently presented.  I will begin with thresholds to which the Minister of State referred.  We must find a way to ensure the finished product in terms of the legislation is a robust mechanism that confronts the accepted practice of non-payment by big contractors in all its guises.  The company to which I referred, GG Roofing, is the perfect example of why the minimum monetary thresholds that put private sector contracts under &euro;200,000 and public sector contracts under &euro;50,000 outside the scope of the legislation must be removed from the Bill.  The thresholds are counter-productive and do not reflect the type of moneys involved for small subcontractors when it comes to issues of non-payment.  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has warned that leaving the thresholds at such a high level would result in all kinds of anomalies.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors is of the opinion that if the threshold is not removed entirely the legislation will be a complete waste of time.  I am pleased the Minister identified thresholds as one of the areas for amendment.</P>
        <P>On the issue of non-binding adjudication, it is broadly agreed that the legislation&rsquo;s failure to make adjudications binding in the event of arbitration is a real cause for concern.  Adjudication is, as the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors Association correctly points out, a low-cost dispute resolution mechanism and is intended to deliver a result in a short timeframe.  The legislation as it stands undermines that objective.  Arbitration and litigation are time consuming and when it comes to the courts years can go by with little result for subcontractors.  The regulatory impact analysis to which the Minister of State referred proposes a two-pillar approach to address this weakness with differing arrangements for public and private contracts.  While it proposes that adjudication would be binding for both public and private contracts it suggests that such awards granted to public contracts should be covered by a bond in the event that the award is overturned at arbitration.</P>
        <P>The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has argued against this solution on the basis that it believes contractors will have difficulty obtaining such a bond thus leaving them unable to secure the award and, in turn, make payments to suppliers and subcontractors.  Alternatively, the CIF proposes that the Bill would give the power to the courts to withhold enforcement of adjudicator&rsquo;s decisions where the court is satisfied that the payer presents the court with evidence that the payee is unlikely to repay the moneys in the event that the dispute is ultimately resolved in favour of the payer in litigation or arbitration proceedings.  I accept there is no simple or immediate solution to the challenge.  The purpose of making the adjudication binding is to provide an alternative to long, drawn-out proceedings as experienced by current arbitration and conciliation procedures which work against small subcontractors.  Often, it suits large contractors with significant resources behind them to drag out challenges to non-payment through existing processes or through the courts.</P>
        <P>Contractors are living with the reality that the value of the construction sector shrunk from &euro;38 billion in 2006 to &euro;9 billion in 2011.  In equal measure, protective measures must be put in place.  The capital expenditure budget has been cut by the Government, a decision that impacts on contractors, subcontractors and the wider economy.  Small subcontractors simply want to be paid for their work.</P>
        <P>The two pillar approach may not work.  In other jurisdictions the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision is enforced and upheld by the courts in the interim.  If we look to our nearest neighbour, in Britain only 300 out of an estimated 18,000 adjudications have been challenged in the courts.</P>
        <P>The section in the Bill dealing with payment claim notices does not appear to include a provision dealing with an instance where a payer fails to respond to a payment claim.  When this occurs, the amount to be paid should be the amount claimed.  This would address the fundamental problem and also give the main contractor an incentive to respond to a payment claim.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact that the Minister of State referred to the issue of suspension limits.  The regulatory impact analysis did not deal with the concerns raised about the suspension limit as set out and as such, I was pleased to hear the Minister of State articulate them.  It is my party&rsquo;s view that the right to suspend work for non-payment cannot be time-restricted to two weeks.  This will not act as a sufficient deterrent under the law.  If the Government was to persist with the two week suspension limit, it would undermine the purpose of the provision.  It would be unreasonable to ask subcontractors to go back to work after two weeks having still not been paid and to incur further costs.  It is welcome that this is a matter on which the Minister of State will table an amendment and that we will address on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>On the inclusion of a trust clause, the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors Association has estimated that, in the case of the six largest construction companies which have gone out of business in the last two years, at least &euro;500 million was left owing to subcontractors, which is astonishing.  The reality for the tens of thousands of tradepersons employed by subcontractors is that &euro;500 million worth of work went unpaid.  It is on this basis that the association has proposed the inclusion of a trust clause in the legislation to ring-fence moneys paid to a main contractor to ensure payments due to subcontractors would be paid in full.  The organisation argues that the moneys should be paid in trust to a main contractor for disbursement to subcontractors to safeguard payments to SME companies.  There are trust provisions in some of the standard contract forms, but they are frequently struck out.  On this basis, a statutory trust provision is required, as applies, for instance, under Canadian law.  We must look at this issue of ring-fencing moneys paid by the payer to the payee for work completed by subcontractors.</P>
        <P>In respect of goods and services, I support the assertion of the regulatory impact analysis that the scope of the Bill needs to be broadened to include goods and products specially manufactured for a project.  The Minister of State mentioned bespoke supplies.  I appreciate that there will be some work to be done to come up with a precise definition because, as has been said, the Irish Concrete Federation points out that products which are integrated into the fabric of buildings such as concrete blocks are irretrievable, a point on which we can agree.  In its submission on the Bill Irish Asphalt notes that bituminous road materials are perishable which must be incorporated within hours of delivery.  The suppliers of these goods and services need robust legislative protection against those who cannot or will not pay.  Existing legislation does not fulfil this role.</P>
        <P>These are my initial thoughts on the Bill.  The manner in which we have gone through this process, certainly from the time I arrived in the D&aacute;il, has been extremely productive.  There is a significant degree of commonality in terms of the outstanding issues that we need to address.  I look forward to seeing the Minister of State&rsquo;s amendments.  It is welcome that he is so open to considering amendments and ideas others might bring forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Bhille seo agus roimh an obair iontach at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Quinn.  L&eacute;irigh mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, tuairim&iacute; mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ar an mBille.  Gan amhras, lig an Rialtas deiridh agus rialt&oacute;ir&iacute; an Aontais Eorpaigh do bhainc&eacute;ir&iacute; agus forbr&oacute;ir&iacute; r&eacute;admhaoine dul am&uacute;.  De bharr sin, t&aacute; ar oibrithe foirgn&iacute;ochta agus &iacute;oc&oacute;ir&iacute; c&aacute;na an praghas is m&oacute; a &iacute;oc.</P>
        <P>Over 160,000 jobs have been lost in the construction industry.  The Central Statistics Office figures indicate that the construction sector accounts for 57% of all job losses since 2007.  Its important to repeat that figure to take in the scale of the collapse.  Almost 60% of the jobs lost in the economy have been lost in the construction sector.  It is a staggering figure which represents a staggering loss of skills.  It is a staggering tragedy for the families and communities concerned.</P>
        <P>I am always angered when commentators and some Ministers refer to the scale of job losses as an adjustment, explaining away the figures as a natural modification.  An adjustment is minor and quick.  What the construction sector and those who work in it have experienced, in both economic and human terms, is catastrophic.</P>
        <P>The boom in construction was promoted by a systemic failure to regulate bank lending and the loss of monetary powers by the State to the European Union.  Continued over-contraction of the industry is the result of systemic failure and the pro-cyclical response by the Government.  The focus has been on a fiscal strategy that removed &euro;3.7 billion in the last budget and has driven demand downwards.  This includes a cut in capital infrastructure spending of &euro;750 million this year and a projected cut of &euro;550 million next year.  The Government&rsquo;s aspirational growth figures are not realisable in these circumstances.  One cannot take &euro;1.3 billion out of the economy over two years and expect this sector to grow.  According to the Department&rsquo;s figures, it will result in 11,000 job losses.</P>
        <P>At the same time as the Government has cut investment in the construction industry, the banks, despite being recapitalised from the public purse, have yet to deal with the problem of impaired loans to SMEs.  The recent findings of the Central Bank are that 58%, the majority of loans to the construction industry, are not performing.  The bank has also found that one third of all capital lent to SMEs last year went to construction, the vast bulk of which was in respect of the roll-over of existing loans.  Private sector demand has fallen off a cliff owing to rising unemployment and the lack of capital.  The sector remains hamstrung by debt and cannot gain access to credit.</P>
        <P>The response of the Government has been to cut the level of public sector investment in physical infrastructure at a time when it is most required.  The failure of the Government to deal with the problem has led to the situation where payments within the sector have been frozen.  As Members throughout the House have stated, one business failure has a knock-on effect on suppliers, contractors and subcontractors.  For all the talk of a possible contagion within the banking sector, it is rife within the construction industry.</P>
        <P>That is why we welcome this Bill as a proposal to free up the flow of money within the construction industry.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>However, there is more to be done if the Government is serious about getting construction workers back to work and developing the sector to a sustainable level.  It should begin by reversing  cuts to infrastructure spending and investing in shovel-ready programmes that will create jobs immediately as well as enhance the long-term competitiveness of the industry.  Other steps that must be taken include investing in the roll-out of broadband, retrofitting of public and private buildings and facilitating new builds in the education sector.  In the North there is 90% medium to fast broadband availability, but the equivalent availability in the South is a mere 4.6%.  Increasing broadband availability by 10% leads to an increase in GDP of 1%.  The Government is failing to take these steps to invest in our long-term competitiveness.  The response, of course, will be that we are broke, but the same Government paid out more than &euro;21 billion to the banks last year.</P>
        <P>There are other issues that must be addressed in the construction industry.  Procurement is of particular importance and something I have discussed with the Minister.  There is a danger that the centralisation of procurement makes it less accessible to small businesses.  It does not have to be that way.  There are actions the Government can take which would ensure, even under a centralised system, that contracts remain accessible to all.  Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the direction in which the Government is headed.  We must have procurement guidelines that allow small and medium-sized enterprises to compete for contracts and which ensure that those winning tenders will enhance local employment and skills and purchase local goods and services.  Operators who secure public contracts must comply with all conditions of the contract, including paying the recognised rates of pay.  There is much anecdotal evidence of contractors and subcontractors on public contracts not paying the going rate and otherwise not respecting the entitlements of workers.  Not only is this severely detrimental to the workers concerned but it also leads to an uneven playing field.  The Government must ensure that the conditions attaching to public contracts are fully complied with if its own policies are not to be fundamentally undermined.</P>
        <P>Ireland is fortunate to have global leaders in the construction sector.  We have the necessary skills and we also have massive excess capacity in the sector.  Those skills are in demand across the globe.  Companies like Kingspan have demonstrated that it is possible for this State to create world-beating products.  The Government must take action to maximise competitiveness within the domestic sector.  It needs to tackle cartelism where it exists in order to drive down costs, particularly energy costs.  Despite the increase in competitiveness in other sectors, high energy costs have served to maintain and increase construction costs.   We must also tackle the black economy, which reduces revenues and fundamentally undermines the ability of legitimate businesses to function.</P>
        <P>There is a range of policy options available to the Government in order to build a sustainable construction sector.  To date, however, it has failed to bring forward effective proposals.  That task has been left, in this instance, to an Independent Senator.  This Government is apparently content to see skilled tradespeople leave Ireland, never to return.  Last year, for example, some 76,000 people left the State, which amounts to nine every hour.  I welcome this Bill as a necessary step towards building a sustainable construction sector.</P>

	<P>I commend Senator Feargal Quinn for bringing this Bill forward, in the last parliamentary term, and the Government on its willingness not only to allow it to proceed through the Houses, but also to support it.  I especially welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes&rsquo;s indication that a regulatory impact analysis was undertaken which deemed the Bill necessary and worthy and offered several useful amendments.  What is notable in all of this is that it is so extraordinary for a Bill of this nature to proceed this far.  The last Private Members&rsquo; Bill initiated in the Seanad to make it into law was the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1965.  I urge the Government to continue on this path of taking a more open-minded approach to legislative proposals from across the floor of both Houses.</P>
        <P>Regulatory impact analysis may sound like an obscure concept but it is essential for good policy-making.  It helps to ensure that legislation coming before the Oireachtas is evidentially based and that we are all aware of the projected impact of its provisions on society, small businesses and so on.  As the Minister of State observed, a commitment in regard to regulatory impact analysis is included in the programme of Government.  However, at the end of last year, just over one third of Bills published by the Government were subjected to this type of analysis.  Clearly, a greater degree of commitment is required in this regard.  We had a stark example of this last week when the Minister for Social Protection indicated that no regulatory impact analysis had been done in respect of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 and, moreover, that none was necessary.  That is not how the Cabinet handbook reads to me.  No poverty impact or gender impact assessment was done.  I described this type of policy-making in an article this week as apparently based on a strategy of pressing different buttons to see what they do.  I do not say that glibly, certainly not in a context where the guillotine was used at all Stages of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill last week.  In fact, research by the Technical Group shows that this Government has used it in the case of nearly 70% of legislation, despite its clear statement of intent to do otherwise in the programme for Government.  Against that background, I welcome the Minister of State drawing attention to the importance of regulatory analyses.  I hope the Government will make greater use of them in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us today is about protecting small businesses from the vagaries of the market and from some of the practices of large businesses.  In preparing for this debate I was shocked to discover some of what goes on in the industry.  I did not realise, for instance, that subcontractors and sub-subcontractors often rely on payment from the main contractor.  That is an extraordinary environment for any business to operate in and I welcome its review.  The Minister of State observed that in an informal industry like the constructions sector, legal protections for the smaller players can be undermined.  There is an ongoing problem in that the payment and resolution process is carried out through the courts.  We have seen in the case of the Internet copyright legislation, for example, that the courts are simply not accessible to most individuals and small businesses.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the pain that has been suffered by workers, individual contractors and small business owners in this industry.  In introducing the Bill in the Seanad in 2010, Senator Quinn noted that more than 500 companies in the sector had failed in 2009, which is an extraordinary number.  He pointed out that the State has an engagement process for the large developers by way of the National Asset Management Agency, with some of these people being paid very generous salaries to work through half finished properties in an effort to resolve their debts.  However, there is no such engagement in respect of individual contractors and small businesses in difficulty.  As I am sure is the case for many Deputies, over the past year I have met many people from the industry &mdash; carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, architects, engineers and quantity surveyors &mdash; and they are in extraordinary levels of distress business-wise and personally.  There are three issues many of them are dealing with at the one time.  They have seen their incomes collapse, with little hope of them increasing again in Ireland in the near future.  As we know, many people in the industry are having to emigrate.  On top of this, they are self-employed and, as we know, the self-employed and small business owners, when they run out of work, do not have the same critical social protections as PAYE workers.  Both issues are compounded by the fact many of those working in the sector bought houses during the bubble.  They cannot now pay them off and they are in negative equity so they are faced with bankruptcy, repossession and little help from the State.  That is not a criticism of this Government, it is a criticism of the system.  We are guilty of hypocrisy in that we urge entrepreneurial activity and the taking of risks by small businessmen, but at the same time, it is implicit that for someone who fails, there will not be the same protection as there is for those who have not taken the same risks, the PAYE workers.  We must address that urgently.</P>
        <P>I have a sad example from my own constituency of a family-owned quarry in Blessington, which has been dealing with many of these issues.  A further issue arose for the business with serious allegations of price fixing or cartel activity in the cement industry.  In an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, Michael Clifford said that if the allegations are true, the State has been defrauded out of hundreds of millions of euros, as the State is the largest buyer of concrete in the country.  He said no State agency or court has ever properly investigated what goes into the market despite decades of complaints.  He further pointed out that investigations in other jurisdictions revealed cartels and price fixing.  I have no idea if there is cartel behaviour but the allegations are serious.  Individuals have brought cases but the failure of the Competition Authority to conduct a meaningful investigation is surprising despite numerous complaints and the evidence of such activity in other jurisdictions over two decades.  Successive Governments have not had the will to pursue this.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority is independent in the performance of its functions but in the Competition Act 2002, there is provision under section 30 for a Minister to order the authority to investigate a particular sector.  It is my understanding the Competition Authority has very limited resources and has made the decision that it does not have resources to take this on based on the evidence that has been presented to it.  I drove around this quarry in Blessington and the owners pointed out to me machinery that was idle and trucks that were being sold one by one to keep staff on.  I spoke to them this morning and they told me that on Friday they had to lay off another four staff.  Day by day and week by week, this is bleeding the country dry, so I urge the Minister to look at the executive authority he has under the Act.</P>
        <P>There are two parts of the Bill that I particularly welcome.  I welcome the breaking of the dependency on the main contractor being paid.  That is very important in addressing a serious power imbalance in the sector.  I also welcome the affordable process contractors and subcontractors can take so they do not have to risk money they do not have to go to the courts.</P>
        <P>I urge the Government to keep focusing on this and to look at bringing in comparable social welfare protection for the entrepreneurs and small business people who really do take risks, putting their houses and savings on the line to create jobs.  It must also ensure the Competition Authority has sufficient resources to investigate these serious allegations.  The Minister is aware that the business rates being charged are killing small businesses.  He should also take another look at upward-only rent reviews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an interesting Bill and I am glad the Minister has an open mind on it.  It is a good start.  This is an absolute minefield and people do not appreciate how much trouble lies within it.  There are a lot of problems in the industry.  It is a crazy industry, and a huge one.  It was not just big in the crazy times we have just been through.  Construction will always be a huge industry in any country in normal times, although it got too big here.  It will, however, always be a huge factor in any economy.</P>
        <P>I have been involved in construction all my life.  I was a subcontractor for years and I was a main contractor for 15 years.  I know both sides.  I have not studied the Bill as much as I should have but I will.  It is interesting and there is much in it.</P>
        <P>The relationship between the main contractor and the subcontractor has always been poor; the subcontractor was always in a weak position.  My own business has collapsed and I owe subcontractors money.  I also owe the Revenue Commissioners money.  I do not, however, owe money to some of the suppliers that people would think need protection.  Some suppliers need protection but those who supply products that get lost in a project, such as concrete, are not necessarily those who most need protection.  I do not owe money to Roadstone, Kilsaran or any concrete supplier, and that is the case for most developers who have gone broke.  They are not the companies that got caught.  It was the smaller suppliers who got caught, such as small hardware providers.  Deputy McDonald spoke about the amount owed to subcontractors following the bust, and the figures are frightening.  There was a knock-on effect and many small suppliers did not get their money because the subcontractors were not paid.  There is a domino effect.</P>
        <P>As a subcontractor, I worked for one of the biggest builders in the country in my early days.  I did &pound;170,000 worth of work for him, labour only, and he gave me &pound;150,000.  I told him he still owed me &pound;20,000 and he told me to go to hell, that he had given me enough.  I thought this was not fair so I went through the legal process to get my money and discovered after six months that the same builder had a good legal team in place to deal with subcontractors and that I was just one of many subcontractors who had been treated in this fashion.  After six months my solicitor told me it would take two years to get my money through the courts and that I would probably be doing well to get two thirds of the amount I was owed.  That was a very unsatisfactory arrangement.  I managed to obtain some of the money owed to me by taking a more unorthodox route, but I will not discuss the details of that matter here.  It is a very good story which I will recount to the Minister of State on another occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should produce an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an uneven relationship between subcontractors and main contractors which is most evident in cases relating to small subcontractors.  The notion that contracts with a value of less than &euro;200,000 will not be included in the legislation is a joke and will completely nullify the good the Bill might do.  Most contracts are for amounts less than &euro;200,000.  Those subcontractors carrying out work on contracts valued at more than this amount have a far better chance of receiving payment than their smaller counterparts.  Those who do general labour work, carpenters, blocklayers, bricklayers, concrete finishers and pavers are in an extremely vulnerable position and require the protection provided by the legislation.  There would be no difficulty in extending its provisions to cover them.</P>
        <P>There are so many problems in this matter that I do not know where to begin.  In most cases where main contractors failed to pay subcontractors, rows or disputes did not erupt.  All that happened was that the main contractor did not pay when the subcontractor wanted to be paid.  I did a great deal of work for local authorities, most of it for Dublin City Council, with which I had an arrangement, whereby I would submit invoices at the end of the month for the work I had carried out.  When I submitted an invoice, it had two weeks to deal with it.  If issues arose in respect of it, it would communicate further with me.  Once it had been agreed, however, it had a two further weeks in which to issue payment.  This was a very fair arrangement.  I was always treated well by the council in all the years I worked for it.  It was a good, fair and honest employer.  Sadly, private contractors leave much to be desired in this regard.  There are some very wonderful and honest contractors.  Unfortunately, however, there are many about whom one could not say this.  For some reason, the industry has attracted a large number of rogues.  There are many involved in it who do not behave in an honest fashion.  More often than not, subcontractors and small suppliers are on the receiving end of their behaviour.</P>
        <P>There is a need to put a new system in place.  If a subcontractor or supplier submits an invoice, there must be a fixed period within which a main contractor must deal with it and issue payment.  Such a system could mirror the arrangement I had with Dublin City Council.  As previous speakers stated, the fact that many of the contracts used in this area up to now have been too informal in nature has given rise to problems.  Therefore, formal contracts should apply for any jobs with a value in excess of &euro;10,000.  The threshold of &euro;200,000 to which I referred is crazy.  A contract with a value of over &euro;10,000 should be protected under the Bill.</P>
        <P>As stated, it is vital that formal contracts be put in place and that there be a set period in which payment must be mad.  It must be recognised, however, that  huge problem remains in the context of how to organise adjudication if there are disputes.  I had a meeting in a coffee shop this morning with a barrister and a solicitor at which we discussed this issue and making progress on it is not going to be easy.  However, there is a need for a system to operate independently of the courts.  The legal process is too long, onerous and expensive and, in many cases, the small contractors to whom I refer cannot afford to go to court.  I am not sure how an adjudication process, particularly one which would give rise to speedy resolutions, might be structured, but there is no doubt that such a process should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to arrive at resolutions of disputes relating to construction contracts.  For example, a contractor might state the relevant work was not done in the way it was supposed to be.  I accept that this sometimes happens.  On a number of occasions as a main contractor I gave subcontractors jobs and it turned out that they were complete chancers.  They were bad calls on my part.  If the work was done wrong in cases such as those to which I refer, I was obliged to pay someone else to do it again.  There was no way I would have given the first individual a second chance, particularly as he was not able to do the work on the first occasion.  There is a major problem in this regard.  How does one prove one is more in the right than a subcontractor who has not done the job required?  If an adjudication panel is going to be established, it must not only have a legal aspect to it but some of its members must also be able to understand the construction industry.  Such individuals must have a knowledge, for example, of carpentry and how concrete and steel are used in construction.  In other words, a broad cross section of individuals with engineering experience and with a background in the various trades must be involved.</P>
        <P>The adjudication panel must be in a position to bring disputes to a speedy conclusion.  However, its decisions must also be binding because it will otherwise be just wasting its time.  If decisions are not binding, major contractors will go to the courts in order to delay matters for God knows how long.  That was the position with regard to the individual to whom I referred who was determined not to pay the money he owed to me and dragged me through the courts for two years.  Subcontractors who are owed large amounts of money and brought before the courts will simply not survive.  They will go out of business long before the legal process reaches its conclusion.  There is no need for me to refer to all of the knock-on effects when someone goes out of business, except to say there is no end to them.</P>
        <P>Am I correct in stating, in the context of the withdrawal of services provision, that if the main contractor does not agree to the adjudication and does not pay the money owed, there will be a right to cease work on the project or close it down?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It can be closed down for a period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the Minister of State is not introducing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a cooling-off period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a dispute and a subcontractor is not paid, is it the case that he will not be able to stop work on the site before the matter is adjudicated on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he cannot do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, the matter must be referred to adjudication before work can be brought to a halt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective is to encourage the parties to become involved in discussions to resolve the matter before adjudication is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>If a contractor does not agree to adjudication, can the work be stopped?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a dangerous area.  I would be the first to admit that culpability often lies with the main contractor.  This is sometimes not the case, however, because on occasion the main contractor could be getting a raw deal from the subcontractor.  For example, such a subcontractor might not do the work right and could then state he was not going to do any further work until he was paid.  If there is going to be a period during which the adjudication panel will try to ascertain where the truth lies and who owes what to whom, it would not be fair to bring work to a halt during that period.  The contractor should not be allowed to get someone else to do the work until the matter was resolved.  If, for example, the subcontractor involved was a carpenter taken on to put in doorframes and hang doors and if there was a dispute, the contractor should not be allowed to contract someone else to finish the work until the dispute had been resolved.  We would be looking for trouble if we were to allow other subcontractors to come on site in such situations in order to finish off particular jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy might join us for the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.  His observations would be extremely useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  Deputy McDonald raised the issue of a bond.  I agree it is too expensive and too difficult for the small subcontractors to get one.  If every subcontractor were to need a bond, the price of them would go up.  There were times when subcontractors could get a fair deal on bonds which were needed for doing State work.  It was an uneven game, however, and requiring them for all work is a step too far.</P>
        <P>Procurement is a different area but needs to be examined.  In Dublin city five large public private partnership projects, such as the regeneration works in Inchicore and Dominick Street, fell through with one builder.  It had reached the stage that this builder was the only one who could tick all the boxes in the procurement process for the last few years of the good days.  This builder got all the jobs he wanted, and more than he could do.  Those five large regeneration projects fell through when the property market fell and the figures changed, resulting in the builder walking away from them.  The reason he had so much on his plate was that no other builder could compete with him in tendering for all these projects as he ticked all the required boxes.  The procurement system is poor and needs to be examined.  I accept this may be outside of the scope of the Bill but it was raised by Deputy Calleary.</P>
        <P>People seem to think the entire subcontracting area ran into problems because of the recession.  The problems existed long before the recession.  I can go back 20 years and speak about problems in the relationship between the subcontractor and the main contractor.  Under no circumstances is this a new issue.</P>
        <P>There has to be protection for suppliers, in particular the small supplier.  There is no point in legislating for the large concrete suppliers which have the most clout.  The small supplier has suffered the most in the past four years.  It is he or she who got paid the least from the contractors when the trouble arrived.</P>
        <P>Deputy Donnelly raised the issue of whether a concrete cartel exists.  If anyone is wondering if there ever was a concrete cartel in this country, he or she can take my word for it there was.  I could not break it and I used to deal with many different concrete suppliers.  Were they doing business together?  They sure were.  No one had the power to break them.  Anyone in the industry is familiar with the concrete cartel, and it is a difficult issue to tackle.</P>
        <P>The issue of contractors getting jobs from local authorities but not being able to finish work, resulting in subcontractors failing to get paid off for State projects was raised.  It is a known fact that not all local authorities have behaved in an honest fashion.  I have said previously that I found Dublin City Council to be honest and I was treated fairly by it.  Around the country, however, it is not always so clean and upfront.  Most of the time builders got work from local authorities through power, influence and contacts.  The relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il, which has ruled the country most of my life, and the building industry has left much to be desired.  This has led to many problems in cases where contractors got work from local authorities when they should not have.  A lot of underhanded stuff went on.</P>
        <P>The need to address the wider issue of local government, which I hope the Government will do, will capture some of the problems in this area which is seriously entrenched in the way local government operates.  For all practical purposes, as Members know, we have no local government in this country when compared to the European model, aside from the fact local government here gets only 20% of the average funding a local government  in Europe gets, the people elected to local government are not put in positions of decision-making, leading to more problems, and it is run by an executive.  Who gets the county manger&rsquo;s job and how he or she gets it determines many other matters further down the tracks.  I hope the Government will address this wider issue.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for his patience.  I look forward seeing how the Bill transpires; it is certainly a good development.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 which has taken a long time to get to this Stage.  I compliment the Government on bringing it forward and Senator Feargal Quinn on initiating it.  It is one of the most overdue Bills and is needed for many reasons.  It is a pity it has not been in place since 2007 when the crash came in the construction industry.  There is much talk on all sides of this House about the pain inflicted on the industry with up to 160,000 jobs lost.  There are many human stories behind these job losses.  This Bill will prevent much of the pain that people have suffered in recent years from happening again.</P>
        <P>The only difficulty is that subcontractors, and those who work for them, are still being destroyed by receiving no payments when a main contractor goes out of business.  Only last week, Mayo County Council had to take control of two sites, the new library in Swinford and Park View estate in Charlestown, as only 95% and 99%, respectively, of them were completed.  The main contractor had been paid up to date but went out of business leaving 40 subcontractors high and dry, losing large amounts of money.  I spoke to several of them this morning to understand more about what happened.  One informed me that because this large contractor in the west had gone out of business last year, the sub-contractor has lost &euro;266,000.  That is unsustainable for a subcontractor and cannot be justified.  Although this Bill is too late for such subcontractors, I hope it will provide certainty for subcontractors in future.  No big business could sustain losses like that, never mind a small subcontractor business.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We often discuss how people are unable to get jobs and although the subcontractor has plenty of offers to price jobs but he cannot take the risk as his business has been destroyed by the losses he has been forced to take.  For many subcontractors, if they are employing two or three workers and have seen business contract over the past few years, at least the workers would get social welfare if they are laid off.  The subcontractors would be self-employed, meaning there is a double whammy as they have no social welfare entitlements at all and are facing utter ruin as a result.  I want to concentrate on the positive aspects of this Bill but it is a live issue; I do not know how long it will take to enact the legislation but that time cannot come soon enough.  It would have been beneficial to have had it in place three years ago.  We should fast-track this through the legislative procedure.</P>
        <P>I understand this will not cover where materials have been supplied to building sites and I hope that can be reconsidered.  If a concrete company supplies thousands of blocks, it would be hard to retrieve them if they were put in a wall, and it would be difficult to recover the value.  The Bill in the Seanad only considered contracts under &euro;200,000, and I welcome that we are examining that again.  Most of the cases I am aware of would be in the lower bracket of the amounts discussed, and if the &euro;200,000 level remained, it would exclude certain cases, which would not be good.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill overall.  There is much work to be done by the Government and this Bill should be put into law as quickly as possible.  Many subcontractors have made the point to me that although many main contractors are slow in making payments, they continue to get Government contracts.  They may even get those contracts if they fail to pay subcontractors completely, and that should be considered by this Government.  We should not hand out contracts to companies which treat subcontractors in such a way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill, which was introduced following the demise of the property industry and with its resulting casualties.  Quite often these casualties were not just the larger, well-known companies, but the smaller contractors which had neither the resources nor the capital to sustain the loses they were ultimately to endure.</P>
        <P>This Bill will predominantly address the problem of non-payment in a balanced manner that would avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.  It will neither impose a cost or risk exposure on the Exchequer or taxpayer by requiring the State to support unpaid businesses or to underwrite their risk of non-payment nor reverse the considerable reforms achieved for the Exchequer in public sector construction procurement, particularly the reformed contracts and terms of engagement for public sector construction projects introduced just a few years ago.  The Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011.  The Bill now before that D&aacute;il was developed after several months of work with the Attorney General while keeping in close contact with the Senator.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to help address the issue of non-payment to construction sector contractors and subcontractors which have completed work on construction projects.  The Bill achieves this through providing statutory arrangements for payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments.  That will reduce a payee&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment.  The Bill will also introduce a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a new statutory right to interim, periodic or stage payments, making clear when the payments become due, their amount and a final date for payment.  There would also be a new statutory right for a payee to suspend performance where a &ldquo;sum due&rdquo; is not paid by the final date for payment; the prohibition of arrangements that make entitlement to payment conditional on certain events, such as &ldquo;pay when paid&rdquo; clauses, which delay payments until the payer has, in turn been paid; and a statutory right for parties to a construction contract to refer payment disputes to adjudication.  There would also be a new adjudication procedure to deal quickly with disputes about payments and to result in a binding decision, under which payment, if any, must be made to the party named in the decision.  An adjudicator would be selected on an agreed basis, by the parties to a contract, or else to be appointed from a panel to be set up by the Minister.  These aspects of the Bill are particularly important and far-reaching, offering a platform for dispute resolution and a mechanism to prevent the escalation of construction and building-related disputes.</P>
        <P>During my work I have personally encountered numerous builders, contractors and subcontractors who have come upon great financial and not to be underestimated personal crises as a result of the construction decline.  From Laytown to Drogheda, Ardee and my home town of Dundalk, I have spoken with and met copious amounts of small contractors in payment disputes.  Perhaps I am in an elevated position to assess and uncover the problem having in a former role run a business that was indirectly related to the construction sector.  Perhaps that is why I am continually meeting people who wish to share their difficulties with me.  Perhaps my previous role allows me to fully understand the pain and anguish that people are suffering, as I have experienced it myself.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not the complete solution and it may be too late for some in the construction sector.  However, this Bill is proactive, far-reaching, and most of all, it is a step in the right direction and will provide a channel for the much maligned small contractor to seek recompense.  The programme for Government commits to introduce new legislation to protect all small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies; this Bill addresses that issue and I have no hesitation commending it to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill before the House.  I have previously mentioned in the House a trip I took to Brussels a couple of months ago, where it was stated that 23 million people are unemployed across the EU, with 23 million small to medium enterprises registered across the Union.  It is vital that the Government focuses on small to medium enterprises and supports them in every possible way.  This Bill has an important role to play in the support of many sole traders in all our constituencies, with implications for employment.</P>
        <P>We all know the sad history associated with the construction boom from the so-called Celtic tiger era, when up to 25% of GNP was taken up by the construction sector.  That was an inflated figure and has brought a significant cost on our economy.  In 2010, it was estimated that 9% of GNP, or close to &euro;12 billion, was taken by this sector, which gives an idea of its importance to the overall economy.  As legislators, we must ensure its survival and support it in every way possible.  The image of many builders was tarnished and brought into disrepute by the actions of a few at the top while many down the ladder worked away at the same pace throughout the Celtic tiger years and are now struggling to support the industry through which they have built a livelihood.  It is important not to tar everybody with the same brush.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is late in the day to introduce this legislation, this highlights the difficulty with legislation.  Much of its must be reactive and this is an example of us having to react to circumstances as we are made aware of them in our constituencies.  Many large builders can rely on NAMA but sole traders and subcontractors are often the silent victims. They do not generate headlines and many column inches in the newspapers but, nonetheless, they are important employers and contributors to our economy.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, which proposes State intervention by creating a regulatory framework to provide for minimum contract terms regardless of whether the contract is written or oral.  It also provides for a speedy review and resolution of construction contract payment disputes as they arise.  The Bill has by and large been welcomed by both Houses.  Many small companies will be delighted when it is enacted.  Many households would have been saved from severe hardship in recent years if these legislative provisions had been implemented at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many employers got into genuine difficulty and were let down by banks and so on midway through a contract.  However, there was also rampant abuse of subcontractors by people and companies who withheld payments from them.  Many of them were supplied with large volumes of material, which cost a multiple of the labour required for a job.  We often think of labour but forget to consider the value of materials provided for a job.  This has a domino effect as this not only affects the subcontractors but also the suppliers of the materials used by them.  This can have huge consequences for businesses struggling in difficult times.  The bill probably falls short  in the protection it offers to material suppliers who may not have a formal contract with the contractor.  For example, the trucks of concrete readymix suppliers deliver product to site in a short time and the value of the delivery is thousands of euro.  The legislation could be strengthened to offer more protection to the material suppliers.  Once a product such as concrete is laid, it is worthless as the supplier cannot retrieve it.  The contract has to have expired as soon as the concrete has been delivered because it is only use for a specific purpose on a site.  The supplier of such a product cannot seek to reclaim his material as it is worthless to him.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision detailing the timeframe for dealing with disputes.  Currently, such disputes take years and significant energy and money and effort on the part of those involved and that will be welcomed by all concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Browne.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to contribute to the debate on this important legislation.  I have asked the Taoiseach on many occasions on the Order of Business when it would be introduced and I am pleased it has been introduced today.  I compliment the Minister for State for bringing it before the House.  He is one of the less partisan Ministers at times.  He made it clear that he regards the legislation as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill and he recognises that Opposition Members and Government backbenchers have valuable contributions to make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is based on having spent a long time on the Opposition benches.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a signal of more to come and I hope the Minister of State will in future accept other Private Members&rsquo; Bill, especially when they have the unanimous support of the House.  For example, I refer to the family home protection Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, prior to Christmas.  It is a worthwhile Bill and I hope the introduction of this legislation is a sign of things to come because we are all democratically elected and we can all play a constructive role in trying to rebuild our economy and putting the country on a better footing and trying to reach reasonable solutions to the many problems facing people.    The construction industry has a negative name, undeservedly in certain regards.  As in every other profession and walk of life, rogues worked in it but it is an important sector in our economy and it has provided great employment down through the years.  Most people in the industry do an honest day&rsquo;s work for an honest day&rsquo;s pay.</P>
        <P>The Bill will address the issue of payments between employers, contractors and subcontractors and it is welcome.  Its main aim is to improve the payment practices within the construction industry by providing for a range of statutory rights for contractors and subcontractors supported by the ability to refer disputes to a fast track adjudication process.  The legislation applies to contracts, whether oral or written, relating to construction operations, which are broadly defined and will include all construction and engineering works as well as professional construction services.  However, it will not apply to construction contracts with a residential occupier or those that may be specifically excluded from its operation by the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>It is right and proper to acknowledge the work of Senator Quinn and the former presidential candidate, Se&aacute;n Gallagher, on this Bill.  It is a pity that it took so long to come before the House but I would like to acknowledge the strident work of Mr. Gallagher.  As a member of Westmeath County Council I received copious documentation from him regarding his endeavours in this regard.  Given the current economic difficulties faced by the country, it is important to put supports in place in the construction industry.  Sustainable businesses in the industry find it increasingly difficult to access credit, which is another issue the Government must pursue vigorously.  Earlier this week, my party leader highlighted the lack of provision of mortgage credit by financial institutions.  Many people with good credit histories are finding it difficult to secure mortgages, which is also having a knock on effect on the construction industry.  In addition, these institutions are using the fact that housing estates have not been taken in charge by local authorities to refuse mortgages, despite fact that, in some cases, 95% of the houses are occupied.  That is having a depressing effect on the domestic economy and this issue needs to be tackled as a priority.</P>
        <P>Deliberate non-payment or delays in payment are common in this industry and it is difficult for compliant builders to match the prices of non-compliant builders who price jobs knowing they will never fulfil their obligations to subcontractors.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>None the less, they are able to get the contract on day one, although someone will be burned at the end of the day.  It is very difficult for the honest to God, compliant contractors who are trying to compete.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes State intervention by creating a regulatory framework to provide for minimum contract terms regardless of whether the contract is written or oral.  It allows for a speedy review and resolution of construction contract payment disputes as they arise to ensure prompt cash flow and thereby improve efficiency.  It is important, given the stagnant domestic economy at present, that we keep cash in circulation and ensure speed in paying our bills.</P>
        <P>Before I finish, I wish to identify some possible improvements to the Bill, although I did not hear all of the Minister&rsquo;s remarks.  It is very important the scope of the Bill is widened to include a provision that would guarantee payment on a construction contract, perhaps through the use of a financial instrument such as a bond or designated trust account.  It is important to remove the minimum monetary thresholds that put private sector contracts under &euro;200,000 and public sector contracts under &euro;50,000 outside the scope of the legislation.  Will action be taken to bring them within its scope?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to broaden the scope of the Bill to include goods and products specially manufactured for a product, namely, concrete, and to include the suppliers.  I have heard many stories of incidents where construction companies, large and small, have left suppliers with large bills and walked off with a nest egg.  These people are competing for contracts but are undercutting compliant contractors who fulfil their obligations to their subcontractors, to Revenue and to suppliers but who are unable to get jobs because the non-compliant contractors are not fulfilling their obligations.  At this stage, the Minister should consider broadening the scope to include suppliers under the remit of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Although it is not primarily connected to this legislation, the Government should examine the awarding of State contracts.  Onerous requirements are being put in place in regard to the previous year&rsquo;s accounts and turnover.  Many small, viable businesses which, due to the downturn in the economy, did not have the normal level of activity in the previous year are precluded from tendering for specific contracts in the current year.  We must examine this situation.  Many small family businesses and medium-sized enterprises have the necessary capability and tax clearance, have met their requirements to their subcontractors and are totally compliant but, because of the reduction in turnover from previous years, they are not even allowed to tender.  While it is a little away from the issues dealt with in the Bill, the Minister should consider it in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is an issue which I, like Deputy Troy, raised on many occasions with Ministers when we were in government but they were slow to recognise the need for such legislation.  The Minister has moved quickly in this regard and I also compliment Senator Feargal Quinn, who pushed this legislation very strongly in the Seanad and got wide support for it among the parties.  The Bill has gone through the Seanad and many amendments, changes and suggestions for change have been made.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said in his opening speech that he was prepared to consider further amendments and prepared to listen to suggestions from Members on this side of the House and from the Government parties with regard to how the Bill could be improved.</P>
        <P>All of us have evidence of how subcontractors were treated over the years by main contractors and by developers, particularly in recent years.  During the building of the main county hall in my county, the main contractor gave untold hardship to subcontractors, practically on a daily basis.  The main contractor might have been in financial difficulty itself but I am sure it was aware of its financial position before it ever applied for the contract on the Wexford county hall or for the contract for the new library in Wexford.  Practically on a daily basis, I and other politicians had subcontractors contacting us to get us to talk to the county manager to find out why they were not being paid.  The county manager and the council would tell us the main contractor was being paid on a regular basis, as per the agreed contract, but subcontractors were left high and dry.</P>
        <P>Eventually, both the company building the county hall and the company building the new library in Wexford went into receivership or examinership and they disappeared.  As a result, many subcontractors were left in a position where they were due hundreds of thousands of euro.  Many had no choice but to go out of business, with a consequent loss of jobs and payments to their workers.  This should not happen again.  Overall, many of the country&rsquo;s largest developers and contractors felt the problems of the downturn in the building industry.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to improve payment practices within the construction industry by providing for a range of statutory rights for subcontractors, supported by the ability to refer disputes to a fast-track adjudication process.  The Bill should not, however, be viewed as an alternative to undertaking appropriate due diligence of the project in which contractors are to be involved, the contract terms under which they are to perform work or provide services and the financial stability of the key players involved.</P>
        <P>The construction industry was always characterised by a degree of informality.  We had very strong, solid construction companies for many years, 99% of which would have honoured their commitments to subcontractors.  Then, in the Celtic tiger or boom era, many new developers and building contractors entered the arena, many of whom had no experience in the construction industry.  In my area, there were solicitors, barristers, accountants and farmers moving into the construction industry who, in my opinion, were not equipped to deal with the situation.  Many of them set up shelf or shell companies, or whatever kind of company it was, and, as a result, they did not deal directly with the subcontractors and contracted out the building of the housing schemes or commercial buildings to a building contractor, who, in turn, hired in huge numbers of subcontractors.</P>
        <P>There was also a situation where many hundreds of people were employed in the construction industry through agencies and had no contract with the developer or the person building the houses.  They were dealing with an agency, they were paid a wage and, in some cases, the workers did not get paid either because of the loose arrangements that existed.  Let us consider the main building contractors in Wexford in recent years.  Despite the downturn in the economy and the low level of building of houses or commercial developments they are still hanging in because they have been part and parcel of the construction industry, they have a good reputation and a good name.  They are able to look after subcontractors and their workers.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, unlike other industries when a construction company goes into liquidation there is no legal entitlement for a subcontractor to remove the goods that have been paid for.  In some cases concrete blocks, plastering, plumbing, painting and the goods of electrical and kitchen contractors form part of a building and, therefore, cannot be easily removed.  As a result, when a company goes into liquidation or receivership, the subcontractor has no rights whatsoever.  When a developer or main contractor goes into liquidation, the liquidator effectively confiscates the subcontractor&rsquo;s goods and sells them off as part of a house or apartment to pay off the developer&rsquo;s debts, which are largely to the banks.  In the majority of such cases subcontractors do not get paid.  In many cases subcontractors have borrowed money from the same bank to purchase the materials supplied.  They continue to owe the bank for the goods that the banks have effectively sold off because the subcontractors have already paid their staff and suppliers.  As a result they are forced out of business.  We have seen this take place on many occasions.  Many subcontractors who have gone out of existence in my county point out that the Revenue Commissioners have the first say, the banks have a say, the examiner or the person overseeing the receivership gets paid, the legal people called in to advise get paid, but, unfortunately, they are left high and dry.</P>
        <P>This is the reason the Bill is before the House.  As I stated at the outset, the Bill should have been enacted years ago.  However, unfortunately during the boom years no Minister in my Government or any previous Government saw fit to do so.  For this reason I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for taking on the Bill and moving it through the Seanad first and now through this House.  I welcome the assurance of the Minister of State that he will seriously consider amendments.  There are other ways and means of improving the Bill.</P>
        <P>There are four main, interconnected proposals.  They would have a fundamental effect on the impact of the legislation.  These proposals were raised in the Seanad debate and as part of a consultation process.  The proposals are a provision that would guarantee payment of a construction contract through the use of a financial instrument such as a bond or a designated trust account; the removal of a minimum monetary threshold for private sector contracts of less than &euro;200,000 and public sector contracts less than &euro;50,000 from outside the scope of legislation; to make the adjudicator&rsquo;s award binding on both parties, regardless of whether the dispute goes to arbitration; and to broaden the scope of the Bill to introduce goods and products, especially those manufactured for a given project, for example, concrete or some of the other products I referred to earlier.</P>
        <P>There has been significant and justifiable criticism of the lack of accountability on the part of the regulators during the recent banking crisis.  Similarly, firms specialising in liquidation and receivership are racking up hundreds of thousands of euro in professional fees per case.  The poor subcontractor is left high and dry.  We cannot reverse the plight of many who have suffered from the fallout of the collapse of the construction sector.  This should not deter us from doing what we can to put in place appropriate legislation and enforcement procedures to ensure that such problems are prevented from recurring.  The Government is certainly moving in the right direction on this issue.  I am pleased that all sides of the House are supportive of the Minister of State.  This legislation should be passed quickly.  A strengthened and enhanced Construction Contracts Bill could have a lasting effect not only on people&rsquo;s lives, jobs, and businesses but on the wider economy.  It will help the wider economy and help to underpin the foundations of a sustainable construction sector in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately the construction industry fell out of kilter in recent years.  It is important for the economy that we get back a reasonable construction industry.  It is important to build houses for the people, especially those on council housing lists throughout the country.  This is probably the quickest way to create jobs with a reasonable construction industry rather than the madcap building industry of the Celtic tiger era.  We should get back to building a reasonable number of houses for our people.  The Construction Contracts Bill will certainly enhance the construction industry in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Tom Hayes.  I am pleased that this Bill is back before the Houses.  I understand it was the last tranche of legislation dealt with by the last Seanad.  There is almost unanimous acknowledgement of the need and the urgency to introduce legislation to regulate payments and disputes in the construction industry.  We have seen and heard evidence of contractors who have failed to pay their subcontractors.  It is not only a matter of the headline cases we hear about in the media; smaller cases arise as well.  There are small contractors who, for whatever reason, do not pay their subcontractors, these subcontractors do not pay their subcontractors in turn and so on.  It cascades throughout the sector.  This is still going on in the current recession.  Some people have suggested it is too late for this legislation but this is not the case because it is still occurring.  Inevitably in a time of recession people are slow to pay.  As a consequence, the subcontractors are forced to continue to supply and carry out work in the hope that they will be paid.  They extend more credit as well.  Eventually, the are very exposed when the inevitable happens.</P>
        <P>We should bear in mind that it is not simply a matter of builders, contractors and subcontractors who fail to pay.  Often, the client fails to pay as well, especially nowadays, whether it is a hotelier or other client.  The previous speaker referred to people who got into the business during the Celtic tiger years and who knew nothing of building and perhaps knew even less about business.  Anyway, they imagined it was the right business to be in.  The most reprehensible of cases, some of which have attracted media attention, are those in which the client pays the contractor but the contractor pockets the money or delays payment so that the subcontractors are forced out of business while the contractor declares insolvency or sails off into the sunset.</P>
        <P>Although the legislation has been introduced against this background, whether in good times or bad, late payments and constant disputes are characteristic of the building industry.  The disputes are time-consuming, costly and often involve going through all the industrial relations procedures of conciliation and arbitration and, finally, the courts.  Often, such cases have continued for years.  The system that has been in place has not served anyone&rsquo;s interests, whether the client, the builder, the developer, the subcontractor or the taxpayer.  Simply put, the risks of non-payment, late payments and possible litigation was built into the pricing of contracts.  Consequently, the price of building in Ireland was extraordinarily high during the Celtic tiger years.  This was not the only reason but it was at least part of the reason.</P>
        <P>Nowadays, construction activity is only a fraction of what it was.  The problem now is not high prices but, perversely, prices are too low.  Such is the anxiety of builders and contractors to get work and so intense is the competition that firms are pricing projects at unsustainably low prices.  Naturally, this increases the likelihood of their going out of business or the collapse of the business as a result as well as the likelihood that subcontractors will not be paid in turn.</P>
        <P>A contract for State payments such as that provided by this legislation as well as a cheap and speedy dispute resolution mechanism will help to normalise prices.  This will benefit everyone as well as protecting subcontractors.  The temptation to increase tender prices is not as likely as risky and late payments are now less likely under the new legislation, and the temptation to offer ridiculously low prices in tenders is less likely also as the inability to pay will quickly become obvious due to the stage payments arrangement.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Quinn for bringing forward the original legislation.  It has been delayed but the consultation period and the impact assessment will produce better and more effective legislation.  The original legislation, which had a very high threshold of &euro;200,000 for private contracts and &euro;50,000 for public contracts, removed from the protection of the legislation the very firms that probably need it most, namely, the small businesses which would have only a small number of contracts on hand at any one time.  I am glad to see the Minister will amend the Bill accordingly to lower the threshold.</P>
        <P>It was also suggested in the original legislation that the adjudication decision will not be binding but it is clear that would be useless because if the parties could agree about a payment there would not be any need for adjudication.  The real danger is that the new adjudication process would be used as another time waster before one got to conciliation and so on, postponing court appearances for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister is more than aware of submissions from the interested parties in the course of the consultation and I mention two with which I have particular sympathy.  The first refers to a situation where the public contracts go to adjudication and a decision in favour of an award is made.  The suggestion is that to safeguard taxpayers in the case of public projects the payee, rather than accept the award, must purchase a bond to guarantee they will be able to repay the money if the court subsequently reverses the decision.  That is not a bond such as the one somebody would get at the start of a building contract. In this case the full amount must be lodged.  Effectively, that wipes out the value of the legislation for public contracts as the award is cancelled out by the necessity to lodge the bond.  In fact, the situation will be worse for contractors doing public work than it is now because their subcontractors will be covered by the legislation, including stage payments, dispute resolution and so on, but they will not be covered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suggested alternative coming from the industry, and which is probably a good idea, recognises the need to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money but that the payers would go to court when they wish to withhold enforcement of the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision.  However, they must establish that there is a genuine likelihood that the money would not be paid.  That is an acceptable and reasonable solution.  It does not penalise all public contractors and to do so would only increase the cost of contracts to the public purse and to the taxpayer because the cost of it would be built into tender prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second submission, which many speakers mentioned, is from the Irish Concrete Federation whose members fear they will not be covered by the term &ldquo;bespoke supplies&rdquo;, in respect of which the Minister intends to table an amendment.  It is clear that manufactured concrete goods and poured concrete by their very nature are unable to be retrieved, resold or reused in the event of a non-payment and therefore that should be covered.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation but the need for a review of this area must be built into it.  Much of the legislation we are introducing is in the aftermath of a crisis and, inevitably, the type of measures we put in place are influenced by our own mindset in the aftermath of a crisis.  It is important, therefore, that we review legislation such as the legislation before the House to ensure it is robust in good and bad times and testing the adequacy and efficacy of the measures is vital.  We must include in the legislation some provision that there would be gathering of the type of data necessary to review and analyse the impact of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Several speakers mentioned the need for other legislation and an examination of other aspects of this industry, including possible collusion in the concrete industry.  I do not know about that but the Competition Authority should be asked to examine to determine if there is evidence of that.  Any builder or construction firm one speaks to raises the problems associated with the fixed price contracts introduced in the context of the Celtic tiger where projects ran over by huge amounts in many cases and the response was the fixed price contract which probably went too far in the other direction.  That must be examined because from having been in a situation where builders could name any price at one stage they are now not paid for extras or any changes the client may make.  There is a need to strike a balance and examine that legislation again.  It was introduced in unusual times and we may need to examine it in a calmer time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Like many Deputies in the House I have consulted with a number of subcontractors in my constituency on this matter.  I appreciate it is a matter of great importance and something they have sought for a long time.  It will give a great deal of assurance to many vulnerable people who were left unpaid in many different areas.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for all his work on this issue.  As someone who was in contact with him on this matter on a regular basis I appreciate the openness he has shown in taking on board the many suggestions, responding to queries and being so open in accepting those queries.</P>
        <P>I thank also my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, and commend Senator Feargal Quinn for his openness.  He pursued this issue from the outset and his work has not gone unnoticed.  People regularly refer to this legislation as the Feargal Quinn Bill, and he must be commended for all the effort he has put into this subject.</P>
        <P>As many of my colleagues noted during the debate, there is not a Deputy in this House who has not been contacted by a subcontractor in recent years.  The pressure they are under is incredible, and this Bill is badly needed to provide some support for them.  In recent years a culture of people not paying appears to have developed, and that is a serious issue.  The reason they cannot pay is understandable.  They are in extreme difficulties.  People can be short of finance and under pressure, and there is nothing as difficult than that.  I understand the reason those people cannot pay but the culture of non-payment is something we must address because it should not be acceptable or allowed.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Construction Contracts Bill is to improve payment practices in the industry, and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication.  That will allow projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation.</P>
        <P>The level of non-payment facing subcontractors and suppliers is shocking.  The most important function of this Bill is to address that problem.  The extensive time between payments on a project is simply too long and it often leaves companies vulnerable to serious loss of revenue.</P>
        <P>There is a balance to be struck between protecting subcontractors and imposing unnecessary cost on the taxpayer.  The challenge the Bill must overcome is finding a way to protect the payments of subcontractors without imposing a system that would require the State to support unpaid businesses or underwrite their risk of non-payment.</P>
        <P>On the costs imposed on taxpayers, significant progress has been made through the introduction of a new contract regime for public works.  This change allows for the appropriate risk transfer from public bodies to contractors and consultants by costing for risks as a fixed price lump sum.  For years we constantly read stories about Government projects running way over budget.  Many of these overruns resulted from a contract system under which a price variation clause was included in many public sector contracts.  I welcome the elimination of such clauses and note that their abolition has resulted in a &euro;300 million annual saving.  This is a major step forward.  The Minister of State should consider addressing similar cases involving local authorities which engage subcontractors.  In recent weeks Deputy Mattie McGrath and I have dealt with a case in Carrick-on-Suir in our constituency where a project has stalled and contractors have been left high and dry.  While this is outside the scope of the debate, the matter should be addressed in the not distant future.</P>
        <P>On the contents of the Bill, I welcome, in particular, the efforts made to address the issue of non-payment.  The legislation provides for the introduction of regular interim payments which will reduce a payee&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment.  On a similar note, the introduction of a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication is welcome.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware of a number of concerns expressed by experts in the industry and others I have identified from a reading of the legislation.  For example, the thresholds included in the Bill are set much too high.  The &euro;200,000 threshold to apply to public sector contracts will exclude many subcontractors and, as a result, fail to protect those most in need.  I commend the Minister of State for identifying the thresholds as an issue and have no doubt he will introduce amendments to reduce them on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>My second concern relates to the possibility of broadening the legislation to include bespoke supplies.  Again, I note that the Minister of State has spoken on this issue and highlighted a number of problems that may be faced if he decides to address supplies and suppliers under the legislation.  I also recognise that the regulatory impact assessment states the inclusion of bespoke supplies made specifically for a contract could be examined.  I hope this matter will be addressed on Committee stage.</P>
        <P>I hope the House does not miss the opportunity provided by this legislation to address the problems faced by suppliers in the construction industry.  Perhaps we should consider better defining what supplies could be protected.  I ask the Minister to consider protecting suppliers of products that cannot be retrieved from a construction site owing to their nature.  For example, concrete blocks cannot be taken back by a supplier if he or she is not paid as they form part of a structure.  I expect and hope we can better define supplies in order that they can be included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister of State will consider these and other suggestions when the Bill comes before the select committee.  It is a strong and robust Bill and if we incorporate some of the changes I propose, it will be made even stronger.  It will also result in a much more honourable way of doing business and afford much better protection to many small companies and subcontractors.  Those affected by non-payment tend to be vulnerable and include the families of workers who experience non-payment.  Subcontractors have been badly affected by the problem of non-payment, especially in recent years.  I thank the Government for introducing legislation to change the position.</P>

	<P>At the height of the boom 269,000 people were working in the construction industry.  This figure has since fallen to approximately 100,000, a major decline that has delivered a massive blow to the construction industry which is clearly on its knees and needs a major stimulus.  The potential to provide more jobs is considerable, although I accept employment in the sector will never return to the levels encountered during the so-called boom.  Jobs in construction have a large spin-off effect in terms of employment in industries that support the sector.</P>
        <P>Local authority housing waiting lists are growing, as is demand for proper affordable housing.  The Government&rsquo;s policy of not supporting social housing and its refusal to provide capital funding is contributing to the current housing crisis.  It is making a mockery of plans to end homelessness through its unwillingness to provide sustainable, affordable social housing and appropriately supported follow-on housing.  Instead, we have emergency accommodation bursting at the seams.</P>
        <P>More than 100,000 families are on housing waiting lists and rental subsidy is costing more than &euro;500 million per annum.  This scandal speaks very clearly to the failure of a policy which no one in his or her right mind believes could solve a housing crisis.  If the ghost estates that litter the country were brought into play, they would alleviate, albeit not solve, the current crisis.</P>
        <P>Many contractors, subcontractors and subcontractors of subcontractors were left high and dry by unscrupulous firms which declared bankruptcy or were taken into the National Asset Management Agency.  Some of their directors received a healthy salary as reward for their complicity in the downfall of the economy.  In my constituency of Dublin North West I have encountered many small family firms which were owed thousands.  Some of them went to the wall as they sought what was rightly theirs, while in other cases the owners sold their homes to pay staff rather than default on their responsibilities.  Others still have emigrated rather than face the prolonged agony of fighting for their entitlements.  It is important that employers and employees live up to their contractual obligations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision in section 6 to introduce a right of adjudication and the stipulation that this right cannot be negated by any contract.  I also welcome the right afforded to contractors to cease work if seven days pass without payment subsequent to a judgment being issued in the adjudication process.  The appropriate Oireachtas committee, in conjunction with the Minister of State, should have a greater role to play in the appointment of the adjudication panel.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the value thresholds provided for will mean that those affected in many of the cases where the protection provided by this legislation may be required will not be eligible to the entitlements established in the Bill.  While small contractors may not deal with large contracts, the sums they are due are just as important as the sums due to large contractors as they seek to keep their businesses afloat and pay their workers and those they owe arising from the routine costs of business.  The high thresholds are a major oversight which render the legislation much less valuable.  Greater clarification is required to establish the rationale used in setting the thresholds.  I acknowledge, however, that the Minister of State has indicated amendments are to be introduced in this regard and look forward to changes being made on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>In general, I welcome the Bill as it makes a start in dealing with the outstanding issues arising from the construction collapse.  I thank Senator Feargal Quinn for the work he did in drawing it up and I am grateful to the Government for facilitating it in the House.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy Dowds, who is sharing time with Deputies Spring and Kyne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertDowds"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be able to speak on this Bill, and in particular I am glad that a Bill which was drafted by an Independent Senator has seen the light of day in this House.  I commend Senator Feargal Quinn for his work on this Bill and I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, on taking the Bill forward.  I look forward to the Government taking on board more constructive and reforming Bills from the backbenches, irrespective of which or any party they come from.</P>
        <P>I have been raising this matter on the Order of Business for some time.  I am concerned that this Bill may have come too late for too many small contractors, as Deputy Ellis has stated.  The fault for that can only rest with the previous Government, as Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill was ready before it collapsed.  Had measures such as this been in place before the property bubble burst, thousands of jobs would probably have been saved, which would have been most welcome.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by several constituents who are owners of small businesses and who were victims of exactly the type of situation which this Bill seeks to prevent from occurring.  The first time I was approached, I was absolutely staggered that a small contractor could be so ill treated by a major contractor.  In the particular case of which I am thinking, the major contractor used any money he got to pay some of his own debts rather than pass on money that was due to the sub-contractor. Unfortunately, all I could say at that time was that the Government intended to bring forward this Bill.  Sadly, it is too late for them, but it is very welcome that this Bill is before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the dispute resolution process in the Bill, which I believe has proved to be very effective in dealing with disputes in the UK.  Any situation where courts can be kept out of the resolution of disputes is welcome.  I hope people in the construction business would welcome a situation whereby they could avoid going to court.  However, I agree with Deputy Wallace when he says the minimum level of a &euro;200,000 contract to be covered under this Bill is too high.  The Bill is designed to protect the small business person, who by definition has smaller contracts.  I am sure the Government has some reason for having it so high, but I ask Minister to reconsider this issue.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that if one of the contracting parties is a State entity, the minimum level will be &euro;50,000. As Deputy Wallace said, however, there is a far greater danger to small contractors from other private contractors than from State entities.  I certainly hope that is the case in any event.  If a &euro;50,000 minimum level is set for the State, then a &euro;50,000 minimum level should be set for the entire industry.  To do otherwise is just leaving the door open for smaller contractors to continue to be bullied by large private contractors and would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  I welcome that the Minister of State acknowledged in his speech that the regulatory impact assessment has recommended that this provision be either removed or reviewed.  I hope this can be examined again at a later stage, and Deputy Tom Hayes made this point.</P>
        <P>Another point I wish to raise is the issue of including suppliers under the Bill.  As the Minister of State mentioned it in his opening speech, I know this issue also arose under the regulatory impact assessment.  The reality is that given the nature of the business of construction, the majority of supplies are bespoke.  How can we seriously facilitate a situation where a supplier is expected to get a court order to have its materials returned?  This would mean going onto a construction site and tearing out the plumbing or the windows.  The  Minister of State argued in his speech against including all suppliers by claiming that arrangements to include numerous suppliers could create an unduly onerous process which could create a barrier to entry for smaller enterprises.  I believe suppliers to the construction industry should be entitled to the cover of this Bill, irrespective of whether the process is onerous.</P>

	<P>Previously I worked for banking institutions in Ireland and I noticed those who were drawing down funds for the purposes of paying subcontractors and suppliers did so in a fashion which in some cases was not as regular as it could have been.  I will not make allegations against individuals, but there is a practice that has gone on heretofore that needs to be stopped.  I think there is a solution to this, and it is called wrapping.  I have spoken to Senator Quinn, to the Ministers, to the Construction Industry Federation and to a few others on this issue.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of how this happens.  A quantity surveyor would act on behalf of a bank while another quantity surveyor would act on behalf of the main contractor.  The main contractor would seek to draw down the funds with great urgency, in many instances up to &euro;1 million at a time.  That money could be sent to another bank rather than drawn down in cheques to pay subcontractors and suppliers.  If that fund is put into a deposit account in another bank and if the main contractor has many different contracts, that person could have a float of about &euro;10 million at any given moment.  There is a 30 day lag with credit, but we have often heard stories of people waiting for 60 days or more to be paid.   If we leverage the &euro;10 million at 90% LTV, the main contractor could ultimately be in a position to become a speculator, with &euro;100 million at his disposal.  That bank would not know where the &euro;100 million was coming from, and the contractor would have the potential not only to be a builder, but also a developer and a speculator as well.  Therein lay the great problem.  I believe we need amending legislation to allow for the provision of funds that are granted by banks for the purposes of working capital only.  If we do that, the money that has been deemed appropriate for the project by the surveyor should be ring-fenced at all times for the subcontractors and suppliers.  This should be the case particularly for those contracts under &euro;200,000, as Deputies Wallace and Dowds have pointed out.</P>
        <P>I know of a big contractor who won a major State contract.  He had 75 subcontractors working on the project, which is a phenomenon that has become known as &ldquo;subbie bashing&rdquo;.  When there are small groups of people working under one contractor, their access to the legal profession and to the courts is not as enticing as it might seem.  The idea of losing &euro;30,000 through legal fees as opposed to taking the hit the first day and staying away from that main contractor thereafter was a real dilemma faced by many people throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I know we have been approached by many lobby groups on this issue, and we should commend Senator Quinn on trying to solve this problem.  I am delighted to have been elected to this House and to have a say on how the Bill goes forward.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers will take this on board.  The people with contracts less than &euro;200,000 need to be protected.  Deputy Heather Humphreys and I organised a presentation to be given by MABS in which we were given an example of this.  We heard of an architect who had sought advice from the MABS because his financial status was making it difficult for him to carry on his business.  He is owed and owes money and it becomes a scramble thereafter.  This is not an issue for upper level businesses.  It relates to day-to-day life, the very survival of a business and the stress communicated throughout society.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done.  I would like to see a working group in the D&aacute;il examine the issue of the protection of small businesses, particularly construction businesses.  I do not know how one can legislate for contracts that were signed in the past, but I would like to see an end to the practice I have described, of funding being drawn down, leveraged and used for other purposes.  I imagine NAMA has a great deal of property on its books for which loans should never have been granted because the equity provided initially was contributed for the sole purpose of giving a contract the capacity to be realised and to be passed on to subcontractors.</P>
        <P>There is overwhelming support for this initiative.  The current level of lending is 9% of what it was at the height of the boom, or the craziness.  That will extend again.  With the availability of credit, there must be better regulation and knowledge of what we are trying to achieve.  Loan to deposit ratios in Ireland might be reflected in some areas, but that is not true of all.  When people draw down funds and use them for a purpose for which they were not intended, there is a problem in society.</P>
        <P>I also make a recommendation to builders.  Builders are best at building, not at speculating and developing.  The idea that a speculator can look at a town or county development plan and then seek to lean on politicians to achieve his or her own purpose will have to be written out of existence.  Tribunals have flushed out much of the craziness in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done.  Therefore, I welcome suggestions from non-Government parties and Independent Deputies.</P>
        <P>Those on the very smallest of contracts must be protected.  The &euro;200,000 limit must be looked at again.  With regard to retrieving supplies, owners of small quarries must also be protected.  We should also have shorter contract terms.  Working capital facilities should have sole designations, in the supervision of which for the banks quantity surveyors might have a role.  I would be happy to work with individuals in the Cabinet and throughout out the House to make this a better Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.  One of the most startling aspects of the economic crisis is the way some large construction or property development companies conducted their business.  Emboldened by irresponsible members of the banking sector, some property developers did not repay substantial loans but merely rolled them over into new loans.  There was, effectively, a house of cards which needed only one non-payment to cause the system to collapse, with serious negative consequences for the parties involved.  Unfortunately, these included small community-sized contractors and subcontractors.</P>
        <P>Because of the financial pressures and not forgetting the gambling nature of some developers, payments for services provided by subcontractors are being withheld or delayed.  Such a practice is abhorrent and shows a lack of regard and respect for other businesses and the people behind them.  It is impossible to plan properly or meet one&rsquo;s own payment requirements if there is uncertainty over the delivery of payments owed to one&rsquo;s own company.  In the light of these difficulties, Senator Feargal Quinn introduced the Construction Contracts Bill 2011 during the dying days of the last Seanad.  The Bill, unfortunately, remained static because of the political climate until its swift reintroduction following the general election.  It aims to ensure prompt cash flow, thereby protecting jobs and facilitating the swift resolution of problems and issues in a non-judicial setting.  It has many positive features and will, in so far as is possible, be cost neutral to the State, which is important at this time.  Lack of resources does not mean positive constructive legislation cannot be enacted.</P>
        <P>The Bill will inject a sense of fairness into a sector that has received considerable criticism and bad press.  It will set out proper and clear payment procedures which, in all truth, should feature in every industry and business transaction.</P>
        <P>Another positive aspect is the embracing of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  The courts system is expensive for businesses and individuals, for reasons that are part of another debate.  Companies under financial pressure can ill-afford the risk, at times, of entering the courts.  Furthermore, the judicial process can heighten tensions and deepen problems, as opposed to mediation and non-judicial resolution mechanisms which can be calmer, less divisive and more constructive.</P>
        <P>The Government demonstrated support for the positive aspects of the Bill and broadly tackling and reforming problematic areas by commissioning a detailed regulatory impact analysis of the Bill.  The analysis outlines three possible courses of action, the first of which is to do nothing.  That would place no extra financial burden on the State, but it is not an option.  The market, as the analysis notes, is not working.  This is leading to delays and disputes and is an inefficient use of our scarce resources.  We all know the trouble doing nothing about regulation and oversight can cause.</P>
        <P>The second course of action is to introduce the Bill, as it stands.  I have outlined its very positive elements which will benefit all involved in the industry by safeguarding and formalising payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third option is to introduce the Bill but with certain amendments.  One amendment is necessary to strengthen the spirit of the Bill.  As it stands, it will not apply to contracts in respect of an individual dwelling which is appropriate, given that its thrust is to assist subcontractors and small contractors.  However, as others have stated, the stipulation that it will not apply to contracts worth less than &euro;200,000 poses a problem.  It effectively excludes significant swathes of contracts that, correctly, would be viewed as the bread and butter contracts for most companies in the construction industry.  The Bill is also out of step with the experience of the industry in the United Kingdom which places a high value on the setting of a lower threshold.  It would be shameful, therefore, to allow the Bill to pass without amending the threshold level and extending its applicability.  It would go against the stated objectives which are to help small and medium-sized business and contractors in the industry.  I would also like to see a measure, as the regulatory impact analysis highlights, to protect the suppliers of goods and materials, particularly of supplies tailored for individual construction contracts.</P>
        <P>One likes to believe fairness and fair play underpin business transactions and in the majority of cases they do.  However, we have a duty, as legislators, to step in and provide support to uphold these principles when they are endangered.  The Construction Contracts Bill 2012, subject to a number of amendments, particularly the lowering of the threshold figures, will achieve this objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be able to speak to the Bill.   I was never as excited about a Bill being brought before the House as I was about this one.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, his staff and Senator Feargal Quinn on the work they have done on it.  I particularly compliment the Minister of State on the bipartisan approach he has taken to it.  He has been prodded and nudged by all of us because all Members can tell horror stories from their constituencies.  The Minister for Finance is also aware of these cases and I am glad he is present in the House to hear the debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has accepted Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill, but it does not matter whose Bill it is, as it is long overdue and eagerly awaited.  Unfortunately for thousands of small companies, it has been introduced years too late.  I condemn the previous Government for not advancing it when Senator Feargal Quinn introduced it.  We thought the construction industry was great, but inside that greatness there was a cancerous rot.</P>
        <P>I compliment all speakers but especially Deputy Arthur Spring who brought his financial expertise gained in a former life in banking to bear on the issue.  Many of the people who have lost their businesses, cannot educate their children or pay their bills and are in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> and in hock to Revenue would not be in that position if the money provided for contracts had been ring-fenced.  I welcome Deputy Arthur Spring&rsquo;s suggested amendment and proposal that a working group be set up in the Oireachtas to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>Funny money was being moved from A to B to Z and nobody knew where it was.  Money that was provided for a construction contract could have been used to buy land, not the site of the contract in question, or to speculate on other matters.  The banks did not know where the money was going.  They could not follow it.  The people who were responsible were able to do it.  We now know that they should not have done it because it was to the cost of many of them but also to the cost of the country and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I will never forget the morning I came to the House during the term of the previous Government when 550 contractors connected with Pierse Construction were meeting in a hotel on the outskirts of Dublin.  They all went out of business.  If that was not a prod to the then Government to act, nothing was.  That is only one of many companies that has since gone out of business with hundreds of small companies left high and dry.  It is shameful.  All of us who were Members of the D&aacute;il at the time should hang our heads in shame because we should have dealt with the issue, yet we did not.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, must come in for a lot of blame as well because it sat around the table during negotiations with the social partners when everything was being divvied up in the good times.  It was comfortable and happy with the situation.  It was also happy to squeeze &mdash; I hate to use the word &ldquo;screw&rdquo; but that is the word I should use &mdash; the small business people.  The small man was kept down.  We thought when we achieved independence in this country and got rid of the British that we would have fair play but we got more greedy than they were.  We were happy to keep the small man down.  The CIF negotiated lucrative rates.</P>
        <P>The minimum wage has been an issue.  I did not support the cutting of it.  I welcome that the issue has been raised.  The minimum rates of payment that were negotiated for some sectors in the trade were ludicrous.  Since I built my house in 1984, the cost of blocks has not even doubled in price but the cost of laying them has increased tenfold.  We got carried away.  Time was a factor as there was pressure involved given completion date clauses in contracts.  The Construction Industry Federation has not stepped up to the plate and dealt with the matter.  It is crying halt now but in the good times it got carried away.  It was not interested in the small business man or the small one-man or two-man operations which are the backbone of this country.</P>
        <P>I shouted across to the T&aacute;naiste today that he should change the record.  I welcome the job announcements.  We need them, but small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  We must be aware of what it costs to entice foreign direct investment companies to set up in this country.  I welcome them all but we must bear in mind the costs involved.  The small businesses to which I refer are based on initiatives that came from people who went to the local technical school and then got their trade qualifications and extended them to become builders.  I agree with Deputy Spring that most of them should not have become speculators.  Most of them did not, but some of them did and we have a mess as a result.  They must be supported and allowed to work.  The Bill is of the utmost importance to them because they must get paid for their work.</P>
        <P>The threshold of &euro;200,000 and &euro;50,000 is totally off the wall.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said he would examine the issue.  The threshold must be reduced to &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 or certainly it must be reduced to &euro;5,000.  If one has given one&rsquo;s time laying blocks, plastering, doing carpentry and possibly supplying materials, a few thousand euro is like a million euro to a big company.  Such a small business man or woman needs the money to put bread and butter on the table to feed himself or herself and his or her family, insure a van and meet all the health and safety requirements.  Sums between &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000 are more important to such a person than a million euro to the big companies.  That must be recognised.  The small men are caught all the time.  They are paying their way, paying VAT, PRSI and taxes, and are not a burden on the State.  What is worse is that in spite of having paid all their taxes, VAT and PRSI, because they were stung by the reckless trading of big companies that did not want to pay them in the first place, now they are not entitled to social welfare payments having paid their own PRSI.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is examining the matter, which I welcome.  Those people are the lifeblood of the economy and we must protect them.</P>
        <P>Deputy Tom Hayes referred to a regeneration project that is currently ongoing in Carrick-on-Suir in the Ballylynch housing estate.  It was built 30 years ago and it is in a terrible state of decay.  Previous Deputies, including Deputy Hayes, and Ministers worked for years, as I did, and it was finally announced that &euro;4 million would be allocated for the project.  As is happening with almost every contract now, local, well-renowned, quality builders in each county &mdash; in my area there are the Hally&rsquo;s, the O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s and the Morris&rsquo;s who have been operating for decades &mdash; that are responsible for the finest monuments and public works and cannot get a chance because companies are coming in and trading recklessly.</P>
        <P>The company in Carrick-on-Suir was involved in four different projects, all paid for by the State.  I accept there was a bond but no bond covers the contractors.  Thank God the bond covers the local authority.  The company in question has left the project high and dry.  It has gone bust and left a trail of destruction after it, including unpaid bills.  Ordinary, decent, hard-working people who gave services and supplies cannot get paid.  Thankfully, the council has the bond which, according to the town manager to whom I spoke, ensures the bondholders can send in a company to certify the work carried out to date is structurally safe and appoint a new contractor to continue the work.  However, that is of little good to the small contractors who have provided the machinery to dig out the foundations, supplied blocks and concrete, the craftsmen and tradesmen who have laid blocks, those who supplied and put in the windows and put on the roof, and the painters and plumbers.</P>
        <P>What happened was disgraceful.  Rip-off Ireland was never better.  Some of those companies knew they would never pay the subcontractors.  That is what happened.  I am a subcontractor myself but, thankfully, I have not been caught for years.  I did get caught on a big project in Clonmel.  My wife manages the business and any time some of those companies rang looking for me to do work, she did not even tell me they called.  She wanted to keep away from them because a lot of them were fly-by-nights.  They had big names and everything else but, as Deputy Spring said, they were spending the money elsewhere and they had no notion of paying the contractors.</P>
        <P>If a company goes into receivership, one will only get a couple of cent in the euro.  The subcontractor is the last person to get anything.  The banks and the Revenue will get money but the small suppliers and self-employed people who are the backbone of the economy will not get a cent.  It is an outrage.  When Pierse Construction went into liquidation 550 small companies were affected.  Since then, thousands of small businesses have been affected.  Some of those involved have been driven to suicide, unfortunately, because they are honourable people who pay their way, paid their workers and everything else.  They got left high and dry.  In some cases it was downright blackguardism that they were caught out because the cowboys who were doing the big jobs never intended to pay them anything in the first place.  The rot must be weeded out and sorted out because it is a disgrace.  It is a shameful practice that should not be allowed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision of an alternative resolution mechanism because we cannot go to the courts.  It could cost &euro;15,000 to get a case into the Circuit Court and then one only might get a judgment in one&rsquo;s favour.  Even if one gets a judgment, one still has to get the money.  It is a waste of time which is only making fat cats fatter in the High Court and Circuit Court.  That is another racket.</P>
        <P>The biggest racket I wish to expose is that of receivership.  It is the newest industry in town.  I appeal to the Minister in that regard.  I could add NAMA to it.  Between receivers and NAMA, they are the biggest show in town.  It is the biggest con-job in town.  The rates receivers charge are astronomical &mdash; hundreds of euro per hour.  If a company goes to the wall for whatever reason leaving many suppliers waiting for money, they will not get a cent but the receivers in many cases are heartless, relentless gangsters and chancers.  They are getting their money from the sweat and blood of ordinary people.  It is outrageous and it has become an entire industry.  One sees the firms involved on both sides.  They act as advisers in many cases.</P>
        <P>When NAMA was set up I described it as a wild animal in the forest and that we would not know where it would end up.  My words are coming true because that is what it is.  It is another big boys club.  Rogue developers are involved in it and are getting healthily paid by NAMA after they banjaxed the country along with the bankers, the regulator and some politicians.  One could ask whether we are ever going to learn.</P>
        <P>This is going on and we must introduce a Bill with the utmost urgency to regulate the receivers because it is the biggest industry in town and it is cronyism.  I do not have words to describe it because it is so bad.  It is so hateful and merciless how they treat people and families.  They have no interest whatsoever in the ordinary suppliers and workers.  Rip-off Ireland is doing well with those industries and with this carry-on.  It cannot and must not be allowed to continue given the times we are in.</P>
        <P>I mentioned company turnover levels.  I accept there is a bond for public buildings but there should be a second bond to cover subcontractors and suppliers.  I understand that is the case in the United States, England and other places to ensure these fellows cannot come in and hire all the subcontractors, get them in first at rock-bottom prices, operate a break-neck, cut-throat business and then have no notion of paying them.</P>
        <P>There should be a bond to cover subcontractors and suppliers.  The situation in Carrick-on-Suir is disgraceful.  People are waiting for their estate to be done up.  They are out of their houses and living in rented accommodation.  The place is a mess.  Thankfully, the local authority had a bond, but some of the subcontractors will not receive a shilling.  Is that fair in this day and age?  The building work will recommence, probably with different subcontractors, but those who have done the work on this occasion will receive nothing.</P>
        <P>I question the term bespoke goods.  This is another minefield for the wigged gentlemen in the High Court who will define it.  The Bill concerns all materials used.  The foundations are the most important part of any development, that is, the concrete used which is a raw material.  It cannot be taken out.  Neither can one take out the blocks and mortar and the plumbing used.  We must, therefore, get away from the clause about which the Minister of State is concerned.  The concrete suppliers&rsquo; federation has lobbied hard on the issue.  They must be entitled to get the money they are owed because it costs a great deal to generate a contract.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly from Wicklow mentioned the quarry company in that county.  There are similar companies are all over the place which cannot get the money they are owed.  I worked for a number of companies 30 years ago, some of which are still operating, but many of them are not.  The best of companies are on their knees.</P>
        <P>I salute road builders such as Sisk and Co.  They have fine expertise and paid everybody.  Some projects were carried out perfectly, managed properly and completed on time and within budget, but in other instances the cowboys took over.  There are cases where things were done right and we can see the fruits of people&rsquo;s labour.  I use those roads every day.  As a result I will be able to travel home this evening in two and quarter hours, whereas it would have taken four hours ten or 20 years ago.  There are good cases, but there are also many cowboys in the industry who give everybody else a bad name.</P>
        <P>What are bespoke supplies?  Will there be endless arguments among lawyers in the High Court to define the term?  The Minister of State should cut out the nonsense by including all supplies used.  He also should include an amendment to ensure all subcontractors who should be bonded will be paid because without them building work could not go ahead and projects would not be completed.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been well put together.  I am interested in hearing whom the Minister of State consulted.  With whom did he consult?  I will be told it was the Construction Industry Federation and others, but he must consult at a lower level.  The farmers contractors association was only set up a number of weeks ago.  In fact, I was at the launch.  They are also contractors who are being caught, left, right and centre.  Ordinary small builders must be consulted, those who do not have the money to join the wealthy man&rsquo;s club of the Construction Industry Federation where we have seen a great deal of money go astray.  I hope the matter will be fully investigated in time, but that is another issue.  They all got around a table and got cosy.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that if an adjudicator&rsquo;s award is not paid in full within seven days of the adjudication decision, the unpaid party has a right to suspend work under the construction contract.  The section sets out the rules governing this arrangement.  This is a vital component.  However, one has one&rsquo;s hand in the dog&rsquo;s mouth.  Where a subcontractor supplying machinery, for example, tells his or her company to stop, the main contractor will get Johnny down the road to do the job for less.  As the subcontractor is afraid he or she will never get what he or she is owed, the bill gets higher and higher and the subcontractor is led a merry dance and then left high and dry.  It is important that one has rights in that instance.</P>
        <P>Section 9 gives the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the power to prepare and publish a code of practice to govern the conduct of adjudications.  However, a code of practice is as useless as a piece of paper in dealing with the cowboys.  We have seen this happen in the case of the Competition Authority which has no funds and no power.  We are aware of the cartel in the concrete sector, to which Members referred.  Millions of euro have been lost to the taxpayer.  The Competition Authority is toothless and powerless to act.  There is inertia which stemmed from high places.  There were cosy deals negotiated with a nod and a wink.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that there was a regulatory impact assessment and that there will be further consultation.  There is too much legislation passed here without any impact assessment being made.  This is an issue which must be addressed.  The Technical Group looks forward to the making of amendments on Committee Stage and considering the rationale for Government intervention.  There must be a good reason to intervene, but intervention is needed.  While the Bill is long overdue, it does not cover all areas, but no doubt we could put another Bill side-by-side with it to deal with the money trail and the funny money.</P>
        <P>We must insert amendments to bring down the thresholds of &euro;50,000 and &euro;200,000, respectively, to &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000, respectively.  The figure of &euro;3,000 or &euro;5,000 is as or more important to the small man working and paying his way than the figure of &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or, for that matter, &euro;10 million to the big guys because it is his livelihood, his bread and butter, to provide an education for his family.  It is keeping him in employment and off the dole.  The small subcontractors are the ones we must support because they offer us hope of recovery.</P>
        <P>I welcome this legislation.  On Tuesday I spoke to different legislation to which I was opposed because it was providing for another layer of bureaucracy to be put in the way of small hauliers and others who were trying to survive in stringent economic times.  We need many more items of legislation, but it is vital that this Bill has a speedy passage through the House.  We should make amendments to it on Committee Stage to ensure it is enacted into law before the summer recess.  On another Bill, somebody asked this morning who would police it.  We do not want another quango, but we certainly want to create fear among rogue builders, in other words, gangsters, that they will not be able to get Government contracts at ridiculously low prices.  Government agencies and local authorities must look at their track records on other projects and put in place a bond for subcontractors, alongside the one put in place for projects, because people are merely being used, abused, blackguarded, threatened, intimidated and whatever else &mdash; I could not use strong enough words for it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a robust debate on the Bill and compliment the Minister of State because since he took office he has taken many imaginative steps.  He has had the first regulatory impact assessment published by a Government and is a man who is interested in accepting Bills from the Opposition.  There have been at least five Private Members&rsquo; Bills presented by the Technical Group since the Government took office and each one has been blindly rejected.  I had one dealing with scrap metal.  I thank the Minister of State for the magnanimous way in which he has accepted and agreed to work with this Bill which he called Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.  It does not matter what it is called.  What is important is that it is passed and made court-proof.  Let us keep it away from the courts.  Having a code of practice is nonsense.  There are too many codes of practice and too many cowboys who merely pay lip-service to them.  I, therefore, look forward to the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to this important legislation.  I compliment the Minister of State on paying attention to the issue, bringing the Bill into the House and following up on the legislation initiated by Senator Feargal Quinn.  Of course, I also compliment other Members of the two Houses who have an interest in this issue.</P>
        <P>Sadly, the experience of the Celtic tiger years, to say the least, leaves many of us with mixed emotions.  Lessons were learned, some them bitter.  One of them was that, even before the squeeze, the fittest had set out to survive at all costs and squeezed those below them.  That was particularly true in the construction sector.  Once it was recognised that things were going to get tougher and tighter in terms of the availability of finance, there was a clear attempt by some to exclude subcontractors and leave them penniless.  People in this country have been left destitute and forced into bankruptcy as a result of that type of scurrilous behaviour.  It is high time that order was imposed and a common understanding restored that such behaviour will not be tolerated.  This is one of many innovations required in the aftermath of the Celtic tiger to ensure we do not end up in the same place again, with people paying the ultimate price in the form of intolerable debt and the economic and social difficulties associated with that.  Such ill effects can endure for many years.</P>
        <P>This Bill reflects the particular nature of the construction sector and was considered the right way to go about addressing the difficulties that have arisen in that industry.  However, its provisions could be applied to all types of contracts right across the board and will probably have a knock-on effect.  The problem common to all contracts is how to address a situation where one party enters into it with all good intent but another party has no intention from the very beginning of honouring it.  That possibility makes it extremely difficult for people to have trust in the whole system of contracts and to have any reassurance that they can expect a reasonable return on their entrepreneurial efforts.  This legislation is testament to the fact that many people have fallen victim to that scenario.  As I have stated in respect of every Bill that is brought before this House, legislation is fine so long as it is observed in the spirit and in the letter and provided it is enforced.  Unfortunately, many legislative provisions and regulations were not observed or enforced during the construction boom.  We are all paying for that now as we discover the extent to which the quality of work suffered as a result.  This is where the contract applies to the consumer in that he or she is entitled to expect that the standards set out will be delivered.  In other words, a contract should do what it says on the tin.  Unfortunately, too often that was not the case during the economic boom we enjoyed or suffered, as the case may be.  In so far as we are now seeing its effects in this and other sectors, it is certainly a question of suffering.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 2007, useful as it was, did not address some of the issues that have emerged in the meantime.  Many consumers entered into contracts to purchase property which ultimately proved to be structurally inferior and to have associated financial difficulties in that the contract did not offer adequate protection to the purchaser.  The State has a duty of care to ensure contracts entered into, under whatever aegis and whether in the public or private sector, adhere to prescribed quality standards.  Those who provide a service to the required standard are entitled to be paid for it and those purchasing that service are entitled to a certain quality of service, whether in regard to a house, bridge, road or whatever.  During the Celtic tiger, however, a type of attitude developed that can be summed up in the phrase: &ldquo;Sure, won&rsquo;t it do?&rdquo;  Priory Hall is the most notable example of developments in respect of which the quality of work would not stand up to scrutiny.  Such failures to deliver the required quality standard amount to a breach of contract.  Somebody always ends up paying for that and, unfortunately, in most cases, it is those at the end of the line who do so.  That is not a reference to a particular socioeconomic status.  Regardless of a person&rsquo;s wealth or poverty, he or she is entitled to an expectation that a contract will be delivered in accordance with the specified quality standards.  We are all entitled to expert a fair return and delivery.  In recent years, however, consumers seem to have been somehow persuaded to expect a watered down version of their rights and to accept, moreover, that those rights should only be applicable and available to those who have sufficient influence and resources to pursue them.  That is not how it should be.</P>
        <P>What we are dealing with is the notion that no matter what, irrespective of developments, issues and outcomes, the main contractor will get paid and, if needs be, the unfortunate subcontractor can go whistle.  This is a serious breach of the law of procedures and practices.  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the quality of work and the quality of inputs.  I recall an incident some years ago where a clerk of works indicated to a local authority that the materials being supplied by a serious player in the construction business for a particular building project were inadequate.  This was reported to the engineer who, without any ado, ordered that the materials be tested.  The clerks&rsquo; suspicions were proved correct, the contract was suspended and the work had to be done all over again.  That is a simple procedure which worked perfectly well 25 years ago.  There was no difficulty with accountability and no confusion as to what should be done in that situation.  Clerks of works knew what they were supposed to do, their superiors in turn knew what they were entitled to do and, by so doing, were able to protect consumers in an effective way and ultimately protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>This is relevant in the context of the legislation before us and in seeking to cope with the bitter reaping of the whirlwind of the boom era that has taken place in recent years and will continue to play out for several years to come.  The bottom line is that a simple expedient to all of these ills would have been to apply the old-fashioned rules instead of tolerating shortcuts, cutting of corners and little chats which involved persuading people to agree to things that were not in order.  The rules should simply have been applied as they were intended tobe applied.  If that had been done, we would not have been necessary to introduce these provisions.</P>

    <Title>Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2011 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome many aspects of this Bill, which contains many important provisions.  I want to highlight the decision made to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board and transfer of its functions and capacities back into the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In this era, when we need to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent as well as possible, such moves must be welcomed and form an essential part of what Fine Gael said it would do at the last general election.</P>
        <P>In making this change, we must acknowledge the work the board was doing is not going to go away.  The work was crucial for the implementation of the spending of dormant accounts in that area.  It is important we ensure that work continues from a different place in the Department and if needs be some of those involved in doing the work will have the opportunity to continue that work, albeit in a different place.  We can make the mistake in dealing with rationalisation of State bodies of assuming that because the body will not be there in the future, the work it did was unnecessary or will disappear.  The work will continue, it just must take place elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the focus in the Bill on the Minister being compelled to draw up an action plan each year on the use of dormant accounts.  This is similar to some arrangements already in place on the use of disbursement schemes and putting together these plans will be done in consultation with other Ministers.  It is my understanding that a copy of the plan and a document supporting it must be laid before the Houses and I hope that will offer an opportunity for us to debate it.</P>
        <P>I say that because we are all aware of the great work the board has done in our constituencies and the activities it has funded.  It is important that use of money, where it is coming from and how it is spent are maintained and that we ensure the activities funded by the board in the past continue to receive funds regardless of how the new scheme is implemented and regardless of where it is sourced from.</P>
        <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, asked a question about the status of the dormant accounts inspection reports, their contents and if they would be available to the Minister.  The answer indicated there were no plans to publish the reports and that the Minister himself, at that stage, had not seen the report.  I believe that report contains information on the number of different institutions that participate in the dormant accounts fund and the contribution they may or may not have made to that fund each year.  In the context of this Bill and the work of the Dormant Accounts Board being moved back into the Department, I want to see this being reviewed and looked at.  It is appropriate that citizens have an understanding of where the money is coming from, who is contributing it and, in the context of taxpayer investment in the banking system, access to it.  Also, the variety of institutions that are capable of contributing to dormant accounts is larger than we would suspect.  It would be helpful for evaluating the operation of the scheme and in the name of transparency that these reports, or their main conclusions, be made available to the public so people can understand where the money comes from and who contributes what.  I understand some of the reluctance around the publication of the reports might involve the fact that they are produced as part of the regulatory role of the Central Bank.  If aspects of them are commercially sensitive or that might impede on the ability of the Central Bank to deliver its regulatory role, I would still hope other parts of the report, particularly on who is contributing what and where the money comes from could be published.</P>
        <P>Credit unions do not contribute to the dormant accounts fund.  There were good reasons for this at the time and I understand that at the moment the credit union movement faces many challenges of its own and is looking at changes that will take place in its structure and regulation.  At the very least, given the change that is taking place on policy on dormant accounts, this should be reviewed to understand if the decision that was made by the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, is still the right decision and if not, why not.  Looking at this from outside the sector that manages dormant accounts, if a particular form of account, regardless of where it is held, meets the definition of dormant as laid down in legislation, I cannot see why that money cannot be sourced from any institution, credit union or otherwise.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to consider the provision on what happens to funding if it has not been claimed in an account after a certain period of time.  As this Bill moves through the D&aacute;il, I would like to find out if the money reverts back to the State if it is not used in the dormant accounts fund or lies in a dormant account beyond a certain period.  I am unsure where that stands at present.</P>
        <P>A feature of the Bill is that all of the powers of the Dormant Accounts Board are being moved back to the Department and the Minister.  If other sources of funding become available in the future, I would like consideration to be given to providing the Minister of the day &mdash; by means of the introduction of a statutory instrument under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; with the ability to classify particular accounts and stores of wealth as meeting the definition of what constitutes a dormant account.  He or she would then be able to bring such accounts or stores of wealth within the framework of dormant accounts and trigger the steps that are necessary for the money they contain to be spent in good ways across different communities.</P>
        <P>As stated at the outset, I welcome both the measures contained in the Bill and the steps the Minister will be obliged to take to ensure the work being done in this area will continue.  I touched on four areas which, in the context of the legislation and the change that is going to be taking place with regard to how dormant accounts are dealt with, I would like to be the subject of discussion.  One of the points I raised relates to what will happen to the moneys involved after a certain period and I would appreciate some clarity on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>My contribution will be quite short because, relatively speaking, this is quite an uncontroversial proposal and one which deserves our support.  Before I outline the single net point I wish to make, I endorse what Deputy Donohoe just stated in his characteristically clear and thoughtful way in respect of transparency.  The Deputy made a very strong point on the reporting requirements.  Where information cannot, should not or will not be placed in the public domain, best practice should be to make the reasons for this public.  I accept that when one is providing such reasons, it is often possible that one will, quite unwittingly, reveal the actual information itself.  I am of the view, however, that best practice should be to publish and be damned.  If it is not possible or appropriate to reveal information, then the public and the Parliament should be informed as to why that is the case.</P>
        <P>It is hardly controversial that the process relating to dormant accounts should be subsumed within the Department in order that it will fall within the remit of the Minister of the day.  The question that arises for me relates to the rationale behind giving responsibility for this process to a separate agency in the first instance.  As the Minister and Deputy Donohoe stated, namely, that in light of the current economic crisis and the financial pressures relating thereto, it makes sense for bodies to either be merged or to be subsumed within their parent Departments.  Perhaps when he is replying, the Minister might indicate the rationale for establishing the Dormant Accounts Board in 2001.  In my limited research on this matter, I have not been able to discover the nature of that rationale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The work of the Dormant Accounts Board relates to the management of the fund and to the disbursement of moneys therefrom to different Departments.  As the Minister outlined with great clarity, we must remind ourselves that the accounting approach taken to these moneys when they are being disbursed is that they are liabilities of individual Departments and recovery is made later by the Exchequer from the dormant accounts fund.  At virtually all stages, this appears to be a Government activity.  I have no wish to seek an inquiry with regard to what happened ten or 12 years ago, although such an exercise might be interesting.  I am merely seeking to understand the rationale for placing responsibility for the dormant accounts fund with an outside agency.  In turn, this will allow us to understand whether it makes sense, as seems to be the case, to take the fund back within the control of the Department.</P>
        <P>In fairness, when welcoming the introduction of the Bill, Deputy Niall Collins of Fianna F&aacute;il stated: &ldquo;For too long my own party was at the forefront of diverting decision making from the relevant Ministers towards third-party quangos.&rdquo;  That was a refreshing statement on the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, might outline the position in respect of this matter.  I accept there might have been governance reasons for bestowing responsibility for the dormant accounts fund on a separate agency.  I do not have sufficient expertise to know whether such reasons exist or whether we might just be missing something.  We are engaged in laudable efforts to reduce the number of quangos that exist and to rationalise the position in respect of the diffusion of powers across the public service in respect of the implementation of policy.  Everyone understands and agrees with the need for this, particularly in light of current economic circumstances.  However, it might not make sense to take the type of action envisaged in the Bill in every instance.  It appears it makes sense to do what is envisaged in this case but perhaps the Minister might take the opportunity to indicate whether any governance concerns arise.  Perhaps those concerns are to be found in the historical background to the establishment of the Dormant Accounts Board ten or 12 years ago.</P>
        <P>The Bill is clear in its intent.  It involves the transferring the function relating to the dormant accounts fund to the Minister.  It is easy to see how this will be done.  Effectively, the Minister will assume responsibility for the fund and the Dormant Accounts Board will be abolished.  The Bill indicates the various assets and liabilities involved will be taken over by the Department.  I presume this includes staff, etc. and that it will, perhaps, lead to savings being made in respect of premises.  In view of the fact that what is being done has been presented as an exercise in economics, will the Minister indicate the net saving to the Exchequer from the abolition of the board and the transfer of its functions to the Department?</P>
        <P>As stated, what is being done makes sense.  However, we owe it to those whom we represent to delve slightly deeper in the context of whether there were any issues which encouraged the then Government to give responsibility for the fund to a separate agency in the first instance.  I accept such concerns could have been misplaced, but equally they may have been well-founded.  All I am seeking is an indication as to what they might be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  The key question in respect of it was asked by Deputy White, who inquired as to why the Dormant Accounts Board was established in the first instance.  The Deputy was too polite to answer that question or even to make a political point in respect of it.  However, he pointed us in the direction of realising that this particular body was unnecessary.  There was an extraordinary proliferation of bodies which were not necessary in or around 2001, when the Dormant Accounts Board came into being.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was flush with money and was very happy to set up a large number of bodies, similar to the board, which were not necessary.  Between 1997 and 2007, Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments established well in excess of 200 bodies.  It is doubtful whether many or any of these were necessary.  It seems there were reasons for each of them but not good ones.  This is, I hope, the first of a number of such Bills which the Government will introduce to abolish unnecessary quangos set up for reasons which are quite apparent now.  In the case of the Dormant Accounts Board, a large sum of money was spotted as being available in dormant bank accounts.  Politicians, being as they were at the time, regarded this as fair game for distribution in a way which they found would be convenient, suitable and politically advantageous.</P>
        <P>The Dormant Accounts Board started off with a significant inflow of approximately &euro;200 million in 2003 which, according to the latest accounts, has been depleted to between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million.  It will obviously be reduced to zero.  If this is the beginning of a quango cull by the Government, it is a welcome move.  Deputy White asked how much will be saved but it will be small.  My concern, therefore, is that this may just be a nominal and token attack on these unnecessary bodies while the majority of them will remain.  I remind the Fine Gael Party that in 2008 it issued a good paper which identified Ireland as the land of 1,000 quangos.  Now that it is in government, the speed at which it is removing them is extraordinarily slow.  If this is the start, it must be welcomed, however.  I hope there will be a concerted attack on unnecessary State bodies from now on.</P>
        <P>The argument that these moneys could have just as easily been managed by the Department is unanswerable.  The procedure for distributing these moneys was that the Dormant Accounts Board produced a plan which went to the Department, then to the Minister and finally to Cabinet.  It was a way that allowed the then Government and politicians to get their hands on small sums of money, in terms of the overall position, but large if they could be used for political advantage and targeting certain areas under the guise of going to particularly worthy projects.  We must be careful when we see, as in this case, large sums of money being targeted at what are obviously good causes.  They could be done by those who are not politicians and who can claim credit for them.  One defence the national lottery always puts up when it comes under criticism for its operations being too costly is the do-not-touch-me-when-I-have-got-the-baby-in-my-arms defence.  It points to all the good it does when it puts in front of its critics the extraordinary and worthy projects it supports.  What it does not look at is the cost or, in fact, the provenance of those who pushed the money in that direction.  The dormant accounts fund was a means of putting large sums in the hands of politicians to distribute to their political advantage.  I welcome the fact the Government is putting a stop to this.</P>
        <P>The late Jim Mitchell, Deputy Donohoe&rsquo;s constituency and party predecessor, called the Dormant Accounts Board, when he was in opposition, the ultimate quango when it was established in 2001.  Charlie McCreevy, the then Minister for Finance, said it was not as the board would operate at arm&rsquo;s length.  No quango operates at arm&rsquo;s length.  What happens is the body operates under the watchful eye of a Minister who ensures it operates to his advantage and decides who is on the board.  To have a body like this with a board in 2001 might have been easy for the State to finance as we were moving into a period when enormous sums of money went through the Exchequer.  The board of this particular body has been treated the same way as any other body.</P>
        <P>I know I am not meant to mention names and I will not.  However, the last Dormant Accounts Board was certainly full of the usual suspects, identifiable by their membership of and commitment to Fianna F&aacute;il.  On the last board, there by right, was a conglomeration of the usual social partnership junkies who were appointed because they delivered the national pay deals on time, such as IBEC and ICTU.  This board then delivered for the Minister.  I will not name those on the last board who fitted into this description but they were there.  They were the same suspects one gets on other State boards.  They are professional State board officeholders who are rewarded with small sums, &euro;7,000, a year.  If one gets enough appointments, however, they become large sums.  There were people on this board who were planted there as a reward or to do the Minister&rsquo;s bidding.</P>
        <P>Apart from the social partnership appointees, there is at least one who I spotted immediately as a Fianna F&aacute;il activist, which is never mentioned in his CV.  There is another who is not only the chief executive of the Irish Banking Federation but was formerly the general secretary of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  It was and remains a disgrace that these boards are treated in this way by successive Governments.  One has to be suspicious that the specific reason this body was set up was because there was money available that could certainly fund looking after a few <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The only reason the Dormant Accounts Board was set up was that the fund provided sufficient funding for that and a great cover for those people who had to be looked after by the Government in power at the time.</P>
        <P>At the end of the day, it was the Minister who made the decision as to where this money went and he, or someone in his party, got the credit for it.  It is very sensible to abolish the Dormant Accounts Board for that reason and now that the fund is so small it can certainly be administered by the Department.  The Act actually states the board can provide independent advice to the Minister as to where the moneys will be distributed.  No board appointed by a Minister with the same colouring as this one, what with a Minister&rsquo;s favourites and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>, can provide independent advice.  The advice such a board provides is the advice the Minister requires.  That is why they are there.  The way Ireland is, they always get reappointed.</P>
        <P>On top of that, this particular body used a public relations company specifically identified with the party that was in power at the time.  Let us not look at it then as some sort of little benign State agency or authority.  It was a State agency which was used for party political purposes.  I hope this will not continue under this Government.  One reason this board is being abolished, which I welcome, is because the Government wants to send out a strong signal that this type of patronage and cronyism is now over.  I say that more in hope than expectation but it would be a welcome sign if that happens.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I note the money will be given to the National Treasury Management Agency in the meantime, with a certain amount kept on deposit to meet various claims that may be made by dormant account beneficiaries.  What is the infatuation in this and the last Government with the NTMA which is, after all, a State monopoly, a super-quango, full of people appointed, continuously and historically, on the same basis as those appointed to the quango we are now abolishing?  The NTMA, to which the money will be given, would be held in far higher esteem if it was not used as a slot for the followers of the political party in power.  Let us not be too starry-eyed about it or talk off the tops of our heads as if we knew nothing about it, which is what people tend to do.  We should not see it as a God, an icon or a deity in the financial firmament of the State.  Successive Taoisigh and Ministers for Finance have paid tribute to its work month after month, year after year without knowing what they are talking about.  They have not made a proper analysis of what goes on, as the results produced by the NTMA with this fund are laughable.  I examined the return some months ago and it had produced no performance assessment.  The results produced by it with other funds are nothing like as good its spin.  It is receiving these funds, but in gauging its performance one should not measure it against the National Pensions Reserve Fund, although some like that comparison.</P>
        <P>NTMA officials repeatedly appear before Oireachtas committees, brief the press and tell Ministers of Finance and Taoisigh &mdash; who know no better &mdash; that it beat the average Irish pension fund by a certain percentage.  They are dead right and Ministers for Finance swoon with admiration.  What they do not realise is that the average Irish pension fund is the worst performer in the world and the NTMA is setting itself against a benchmark that is so bad a babe in arms would have beaten it.  A monkey throwing darts at a target would beat the benchmark.  Therefore, we should not be starry-eyed and assume the money is safe in the hands of the NTMA.  It is in the hands of a body which, if compared to other bodies, does not perform particularly well; it is not the worst, but it is certainly no star.  When it sets itself against the benchmark set by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, it seems like a big star because it is competing against the worst in the world.</P>
        <P>Figures have come from the NTMA for the salaries of its top people and they are absolutely disgraceful.  I am surprised the Government has continued to tolerate these figures and fees.  The chief executive has taken a cut, but it is not nearly enough and he still receives a banking-type salary for a moderate performance.  We all know bankers are paid far too much, but the head of the NTMA received a salary of &euro;495,000 up to last year and we knew this was far too much.  The NTMA is part of the banking bonus culture, to which we thought we saw an end, and although it has suspended the payment of bonuses for one year, it gave them when the banks gave them, despite a very moderate performance.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State considers this issue, will she indicate if this is the forerunner to a process to abolish many of the quangos?  The Labour Party&rsquo;s colleagues in government promised that they would be culled, abolished and reduced.  This should not equate to half a dozen being eliminated or lead to the creation of more quangos.  This should be the forerunner to a logical forensic examination and analysis of some of the quangos which are much bigger than the one with which we are dealing.  It should also mean we will no longer be frightened to criticise those icons which have frightened or dazzled us.  The Minister and the rest of the Cabinet should examine the National Treasury Management Agency with a critical eye and not be besotted by the figures it gives.  We should know when something is wrong and there is underperformance.  The NTMA is an icon which deserves criticism, as it does not stand up to normal performance criteria.  If that is the spirit in which the body dealt with in the Bill is being examined and abolished, I welcome the legislation.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

        <P Just="Left">During the years funds from the dormant accounts fund and the work of the Dormant Accounts Board have benefited many communities, especially those in areas which are socially and economically disadvantaged.  There are many projects and programmes which have benefited from the grants paid which nobody would dispute, although some of the reasoning behind the refusal of applications of some groups has been questioned.  In the main, however, the funding from the dormant accounts fund has had a positive effect on communities in helping projects and schemes to get off the ground and allowing others to develop.  This occurred in an period when other funds were available, but we are now entering a different era.  The bulk of the money in the dormant accounts fund has been expended and is no longer available for disbursement.  This Bill changes some of the nature of the original ideal behind the dormant accounts process.  I have some sympathy with those who wish to get rid of the dormant accounts board and see that responsibility ceded back to a Department and Minister but it is not the correct step.  </P><P Just="Left">A board like this dormant accounts board should be in place, although the members should not be paid; instead, it should be an honour for people to serve on it.  There is an example of how that facility has worked, with community participants, elected representatives, council officials and garda&iacute; attending joint policing committees.  They discuss policy and take decisions but nobody is getting paid specifically to sit on those board.  There is not a significant administrative cost either, so it is an example of how we could have a more democratically reflective board to deal with dormant accounts.  That is in preference to ending the process completely and ceding the responsibility to a Minister, leaving that Minister open to the accusation that the fund would become a ministerial slush fund.  If the Minister intends proceeding that way, an Oireachtas committee should have oversight or at least should have to be consulted by him or her prior to making a decision or the committee could make the decision which would be rubber stamped by the Minister.  That would allow for the transparency everybody seeks and prevent a single vested interest taking the decision, thereby dismissing charges of political favouritism that could be levelled.  For example, when Ministers had the opportunity to administer grants under the sports capital programme, their constituencies benefitted much more than others.  I do not have an expertise in this area but I read about these charges being levelled against some Ministers.  The Minister should not open up that possibility.  At the very least, therefore, the Oireachtas should have oversight of the dormant accounts fund through a committee or, preferably, a stand alone body should oversee the fund but it should not pay the attendance fees of its board members.  People who are grounded in the community and who have expertise will, hopefully, offer their time for the benefit of their communities.  The reason the fund was set up was to use money in dormant bank accounts, which was only benefiting the financial institutions, for the good of all.  That is why I support the ideal of the fund.  If the board comprised volunteers who were not paid fees, the membership could rotate and three-year terms of office could be used rather than five years.  That would provide for through flow in expertise that would reflect the different fields covered by the grants and the population spread in Ireland, which is important.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ross raised the question of the NTMA controlling the fund.  The Minister should invest the money in An Post savings bonds rather than use the NTMA as the holding company for the fund, as this would boost the assets of An Post.  Somebody who invests in one of the company&rsquo;s savings accounts is better off than those who invested in NTMA pension funds, which are under severe strain.  The savings accounts yield a greater return with the NTMA not being as effective in using moneys invested with it to generate a good return.  The agency may be good at managing money but it has not generated great returns for the Government.  The money from the dormant accounts fund could also be invested in Government bonds which would be cashed in as required.  Last year, the national solidarity bond was announced and money could be invested in that, although it is managed by the NTMA.  If the money was invested in Government bonds, it could be drawn down as required when grants are paid out.</P>
        <P>While my concerns are minor criticisms, I do not oppose the Bill.  The amount in the fund is reducing and I wonder whether the fund could be enhanced.  How could we boost this fund to address shortfalls in funding of community groups, in particular, and other projects in disadvantaged areas?  Money confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau or the courts is diverted to the Exchequer because it is treated as revenue when, in fact, it is the proceeds of crime following the sale of cars, yachts and houses.  I have argued with previous Ministers about this but they said such moneys could not be ring-fenced.  However, I have proven that this is done.  For example, the plastic bag levy is ring-fenced for environmental purposes.  CAB confiscated moneys should be diverted to the communities most affected by crime.  In most cases, these are disadvantaged communities.  This pot of money could be transferred to bolster the dormant accounts fund and enable it to fulfil the role it was established to play.</P>
        <P>In addition, judges often direct that money be put in the poor box.  While this is administered by the Courts Service and a number of charities benefit, this process is not transparent and we do not know where the money goes.  The charities that benefit know, but if this money was transferred to the dormant accounts fund, it would be recognised publicly.  If the money was transferred to the fund, it could be administered openly to the benefit of all.</P>
        <P>This is not a contentious Bill but I am adamant that a Minister should not have it within his or her gift to administer the fund.  The pot of gold available to community groups in recent years has reduced and it looks like the finance available to them will be restricted for another few years.  This means they have had to cut back on programmes and they have been forced to scour everywhere for money for summer projects for senior citizen outings, further education, keep fit groups etc., and for the refurbishment of community halls and so on.  Previously, they could access money from local authorities or the sports capital programme but this funding has been squeezed repeatedly.  If the dormant accounts fund was enhanced in the ways I suggest, that might restore the faith of some struggling communities.  They have to fund raise among their own people who have been hit in their pockets through increased taxes and the increased cost of living.  Many community organisations have had to scale back their hours and the opening times of their centres or had to cancel projects altogether.  That is why I support an enhanced fund to ensure the community programmes administered by various Departments can be fully funded as they were previously.  I appeal to the Minister to find additional sources of money, ring-fence them for the dormant accounts fund and keep the money on deposit with An Post.  This would benefit the company, as its balance sheet has been struggling.  It would be nice for An Post to have this pot of gold on its balance sheet and, therefore, there would be a double benefit.  It would also take some of the pressure off the NTMA, which has not been delivering in terms of returns on other investments it has been asked to deliver upon.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will be altered on Committee Stage to reflect some of the points made by other speakers but also to reflect some of my points.  It could never then be levelled at us that we put together a Bill which ended up doing exactly what it set out not to do, namely, promote political patronage.  We do not want that, and it is one of the criticisms the Dormant Accounts Board had levelled against others.  We want to make sure that whatever happens here is as transparent as possible and that this is not a political slush fund for whoever is in government to disperse in specific constituencies or on specific projects for electoral purposes.  This area is too important for that.</P>
        <P>The fund is to address disadvantage, and I do not mean disadvantage that emerged this year or last year.  Some of the areas that have benefited in a small way from the moneys in dormant accounts have been disadvantaged for many generations.  While this pot will not solve their problems and will not address all of their issues, it might help with some of the smaller issues or give a leg-up to some of the projects and schemes, whether it is a case of educational schemes, after-school clubs, cr&egrave;ches, school arts and music programmes which try to lift an area in general, or the whole range of other programmes which have been affected.</P>
        <P>In my area many people have benefited and have been very welcoming of this fund, and they were concerned about what would happen when the fund ran out.  This is why I suggested the use of CAB moneys, court moneys or a similar, once-off pot of money that had not been accounted for in the past.  For example, the DIRT inquiry brought in a lot of money.  When money comes in which is outside the normal, it should be ring-fenced and used for abnormal projects.  These projects are abnormal because they are addressing key problems and key areas of inequality in our society, which is a good thing.  I hope the Minister will reflect on the points I have made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by responding to one point made by my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  For many years, I have heard about the diminishing amount in the dormant accounts fund.  I can never understand this.  Dormant accounts, as the description entails, should mean they are accounts that become dormant in the natural course of events over a period of years.  However, that should be an ongoing development and this should not only apply to last year, five years ago or ten years ago.  However dormant accounts occurred, the same occurrence must continue into the future, unless there is some point I do not understand.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue previously by way of parliamentary questions in recent years.  While the replies to those questions stated the funds accruing from the dormant accounts were diminishing, I still do not understand how this could be.  Dormant accounts occurred as a result of people being untraceable and their accounts falling into the hands of the lending institutions at a time before the Dormant Accounts Board was set up by the State.  I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts at the time the investigation took place which was the foundation of, and as a result of which agreement was reached on the setting up of, the dormant accounts fund.  I agree with other speakers that a great deal of very useful work has been carried out through the funding that came from that body over the years.  However, I must return to my original point.  If accounts became dormant during, say, a ten year period in the 1980s and the fund then grew in the 1990s, which would have happened unless moneys were disbursed to some or other quarter, which would have diminished the fund, nonetheless, there would always be a naturally upcoming tranche of newly dormant accounts that would be transferred to the dormant accounts fund for disbursement at the discretion of the board.</P>
        <P>I cannot for the life of me understand how the incoming amounts could have diminished or slowed down.  Surely the same number of people are dying as died before and the same average number of people are dying intestate or dying without having left any direction in respect of insurance investments or bank accounts.  The question arises, therefore, as to the amount which is about to be transferred having diminished.  I have no difficulty with the transfer to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and I have no doubt the funding will be disbursed in a proper and orderly way.  The question remains, however, as to why the fund should be diminishing.  The answer always given, of course, has been that the funds have been disbursed.  How did the funds grow in the first place, however, other than through the means to which I have just referred?</P>
        <P>The question I would love to know the answer to, although I think I know the answer, is what has happened since the setting up of the Dormant Accounts Board whereby the funds flowed into the hands of the State as opposed to previously flowing into the hands of the lending institutions.  What has happened that has changed that inflow in the period since the board was set up?  The Minister of State might make some comment on that in her reply, which would be very interesting.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the NTMA.  With the passage of time we tend to become critical of bodies and boards, for one reason or another.  The NTMA has a very difficult job to do and it has done a fairly good job.  It got the job of managing and trying to wrestle with the debt that arose in the 1970s, which is still hanging around our necks and has not been paid off yet.  What happened in the meantime is that growth and inflation caught up and the amount diminished as a proportion of GDP.  Of course, we had the more recent ground shuddering events which saw the explosion of the Celtic tiger.  We now know that increased management of funds will be required in respect of which the greatest degree of expertise ever known will be required in order to manoeuvre our way through the obstacle course that lies ahead of us.</P>
        <P>A point that needs to be made in passing, and reference has been made to it in the course of this debate, concerns NAMA.  There are many criticisms of NAMA, with some of which I agree.  However, we need to know also that NAMA and everything that goes with it is owned by the taxpayer.  When NAMA was set up &mdash; I was in the House on the night of the debate &mdash; its purpose was ultimately to achieve the best possible result for the taxpayer in the disposal of its assets at a later stage.  While it is laudable for people to say we should dispose of as much as we can through local communities for their enjoyment, and this would be some recompense for hardship and so on, that is not what is was set up for.  It was set up in order to address the incredible plunge in terms of financial and banking services and the property sector, in particular to address the diminishing value of collateral that was held by the banks or lending institutions.  It is easy to understand why some suggest some of the funds should be allocated to various deserving groups, but that is not why the fund was created.  The duty of the State is to maximise its value and dispose of whatever it can in whatever way it can to secure recompense for the taxpayer who, ultimately, must pay for all of this.  The day when some things were free is long gone; there are no free lunches anymore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is no harm to reflect on these matters.  The dormant accounts fund concept was good in the sense that instead of the proceeds filtering into financial institutions which were the custodians before the introduction of the legislation and the establishment of the board, it was deemed preferable that the funds flow to the State.  This is because at least the State has some responsibility to look after the citizenry, to whom it has a duty of care.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report suggested &euro;1.7 million could be saved by the transfer of the functions of the board to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This may be the case, but it brings to mind that awful word &ldquo;administration&rdquo;.  Administration nowadays is more circuitous, long-winded and expensive than it was 25 or 30 years ago, although the opposite should be the case.  In the days before computerisation there was a direct system, under which, in so far as possible, administration was curtailed to maximise the impact and ensure the minimum of interference and red tape.  Unfortunately, nowadays the reverse is the case.  While I welcome the reduced costs of administration of the fund as a result of the proposed change, I have serious doubts about the way society is progressing, with particular reference to the cost of various administrations.  I wish to illustrate this point.  The simplest of application forms a citizen must use to apply for anything may run to 20 pages.  Boxes must be ticked which are then scanned by computers.  Consequently, the forms must be filled in a particular fashion.  I imagine the Acting Chairman and the Minister of State have had similar experiences.  What was the person who created the form thinking when he or she couched certain questions in a given way?  This is especially the case if the same question is asked again two or ten pages later.  It is as if he or she does not believe the answer from the citizen in filling in the application form.  The idea appears to be to ask the same question again and if the same answer is given, the authority presumes it is the truth, but, if it is not, it assumes the citizen is lying either in the first or second instance.  My comments relate simply to the cost of administration which has gone through the ceiling and it is not totally the result of cost of living increases.  Costs have escalated because administration has become more circuitous and detailed, to the extent that in some cases the details are irrelevant and make no difference.  God be with the days when one could use a simple application form to do a simple job and achieve simple results for one quarter of the cost.  Let us remember that every document to be filed or filled in requires another person to examine it who sometimes must examine it twice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Acting Chairman and the Minister of State will be familiar with the following example of administration costs at their worst.  Let us consider the case of a person applying for a local authority house.  He or she must fill in an application form and state he or she did not have a house previously.  He or she must write to the Revenue Commissioners to get proof of this.  Revenue will stamp the form and return it to him or her, perhaps three weeks later, by which time he or she will wonder why he or she had to fill in the form in the first place.  It will then lie dormant in the household for several months until the public representative writes to the local authority to explain that the applicant has heard nothing and ask for an update.  It will then emerge that the form and the certification from the Revenue Commissioners were not forwarded because time had elapsed.</P>
        <P>Let us suppose a person applying for a given service or facility is divorced or separated and had previously, either jointly or individually, taken out a mortgage, in respect of which he or she had claimed mortgage interest relief from the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners, correctly, cannot approve such a form.  However, the applicant is obliged to send it to them in order that they can reply indicating that they cannot approve such an application because the person had previously claimed income tax relief on a mortgage.  Is it necessary to go to these extremes to prove a point?  These are simply two examples of the way administration costs have gone mad.</P>
        <P>I hope the proposed figure of &euro;1.7 million can be saved as part of the proposal, but I am unsure.  We must wait and see.  I sincerely hope whatever good uses to which the funds have been put will be mirrored in the future to the benefit of taxpayers and the citizenry, which is as it should be.</P>
        <P>There should be designation of disadvantaged areas, which is good.  However, I am somewhat concerned about the concept of ring-fencing programmes funded by the taxpayer or which fall under the authority of the taxpayer.  There is a problem if a programme has been specifically designed to be implemented in one direction only.  This becomes administratively costly and the general good of the community is not necessarily always met as intended.</P>
        <P>I am still in a quandary and have no doubt the Acting Chairman is in the same position.  I cannot understand why the funds are diminishing.  For example, if there were 20,000 dormant accounts in a 20 year period between 1960 and 1980, how could the number diminish in the period between 1980 and 2000?  This will remain a mystery.  Like all things, however, I must accept that certain matters remain a mystery until such time as someone decides to enlighten me.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be good enough to take me out of my agony, to some extent at least, if not to the extent I desire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who have contributed to the debate.  Several contributors focused on the nature of dormant accounts, apart from the provisions of the Bill which  serves to tidy some administrative matters, as well as dissolving the Dormant Accounts Board which will give rise to modest annual savings.  I realise Deputies White and Ross sought a more accurate figure of the savings to be made, but &ldquo;modest&rdquo; is the term I offer.  We will probably have more accurate accounts at a later stage.</P>
        <P>When dormant accounts legislation was first introduced, the priority was to ensure the large financial institutions would not benefit from the money, that it would either be returned to account holders or be used for the benefit of the community by people who were deprived or disadvantaged.  The application of unclaimed funds lying in dormant accounts where the legal owners cannot be identified has proven very successful in making resources available to assist community projects and to tackle disadvantage.  Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of December 2011, the transfers of the dormant accounts fund have totalled &euro;631 million, which includes interest earned of &euro;35.5 million.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately &euro;228.9 million, with almost &euro;247.5 million disbursed from the fund.</P>
        <P>These moneys have been applied to the public good rather than making a contribution to the bottom lines of financial institutions.  That said, at a time of severe budgetary pressures resulting in reduced allocations across Departments, there is a need to prioritise and to try to main existing funding programmes in the first instance.  Expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes could potentially reduce spending on other existing programmes and would serve to increase Government debt levels as the money belongs to the account holder who can reclaim it at any time and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability and, therefore, dormant accounts funding cannot be regarded as free money.</P>
        <P>This Bill, which allows for the dissolution of the Dormant Accounts Board, will transfer the statutory functions of the board to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It will assist with the requirement to reduce the number of State bodies which, as the Minister, Deputy Hogan, indicated to the House previously, is part of this Government&rsquo;s strategy to streamline Government business.</P>

The relevant joint committee of the Oireachtas has separate powers to require the Minister to appear before it.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I cannot answer Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s conundrum at this stage just as he has not been able to answer it over the years.  There will be an opportunity on the further Stages of the Bill for other issues to be teased out, and perhaps Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s issue can be teased out in those debates. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

The recent job opportunities announced by the Department, IDA Ireland and others have highlighted the change in the Irish economy and also the need for a cohort of skilled graduates in the areas of science and engineering.  We must ask ourselves two questions in that regard.  How is Ireland positioned in terms of the degree courses we offer and how can we ensure we are maximising the opportunities for our younger people to allow them get employment here?  We must start that process at the primary and second level curriculum and look specifically at science and innovation and our mathematics and science curricula.</P>
        <P>There is an interest in this area.  One only has to consider the BT Young Scientist Exhibition held every year in the RDS to know there is a wealth of creativity and innovation among our young people, as demonstrated clearly at that event.  In my part of the world the University of Limerick was to the fore in developing degree courses that reflected the needs of the economy at the time and there were successful job announcements over the years in the Limerick area as a result, but year in, year out, following the leaving certificate and junior certificate results, employers&rsquo; groups, teachers, parents and others express concern about the numbers of students studying mathematics at higher level and the numbers studying science, particularly the sciences of physics, chemistry and physics and chemistry combined.</P>
        <P>A holistic examination of that area will have to be done involving the Department, employers, parents, teachers and other stakeholders in terms of developing it in the future.  The Minister of State will probably refer to the fact that the junior certificate syllabus will be examined again by the Department but we are almost unique in Europe in that we are one of the only countries in the European Union which does not require science to be studied as a mandatory subject at junior level.</P>
        <P>The statistics speak for themselves.  The numbers taking up higher level mathematics fell from just under 18% to just over 15% between 2006 to 2011 and for applied mathematics, which is essential for many people going into civil engineering, electronic engineering and so on, the decrease is 2%.  It is obvious there is a problem in that regard.</P>
        <P>There was a move recently to examine Project Maths and bonus points in terms of the uptake of mathematics at higher level, but I do not believe that is the only answer.  There is a temptation, and I have said this directly to the Minister and the Minister of State, to dumb down the mathematics curriculum in the hope that more people will take up the subject, but we must look beyond that.  Recently, the Department found itself in an embarrassing situation when it could not tell how many people were qualified to teach higher level mathematics.  That raises the question of how many people are qualified to teach physics, chemistry or applied mathematics in second level schools.</P>
        <P>There is also a temptation to overload the curriculum.  Already at primary level there are 12 subjects on the curriculum from junior infants to sixth class, and 26 subjects are available at junior certificate level, although science is not mandatory.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will probably refer when replying to the change in terms of rote learning and so on but it is not that long since I was in school and up to junior certificate level, and other Deputies will recall this also, one was not allowed use a calculator.  Students can now use a calculator at primary level with the result that students are coming out of primary school unable to do basic tables, arithmetic or even basic sums in their heads.  We then wonder why students at leaving certificate level are not taking on higher level mathematics.  Unfortunately, it is because in many cases the basic concepts are not being taught.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the numbers of second level students studying leaving certificate mathematics and sciences at higher level and to summarise the initiatives addressing this topic.</P>
        <P>Project Maths began as a pilot in 24 schools in 2008.  It is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  It was mainstreamed from September 2010 when it became available to all schools.  Project Maths is designed to transform teaching and learning in mathematics at both junior and senior cycle.  It would enable students to develop an understanding of the &ldquo;hows and whys&rdquo; of mathematics but also the ability to apply their knowledge and skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.  It should also provide them with analytical and creative powers in mathematics.  A key objective of Project Maths is to improve attainment levels in mathematics and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.  The first mainstream examinations are for this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate students and the first group of students presenting for the junior certificate will be in 2013.  The introduction of Project Maths has been accompanied by a national programme of professional development for all teachers, not just those in the project schools, and this will continue to at least 2013.</P>
        <P>The participation in higher level mathematics was down from a high of 18.9% in 2005 to 15.8% in 2011.  To encourage more students to present at higher level, there will be 25 bonus CAO points available for all candidates who score grade D3 or above for higher level mathematics in the leaving certificate from this summer.  Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate this bonus points scheme for higher level mathematics for a four year trial period from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, with a review in 2014.</P>
        <P>The bonus points scheme aims to incentivise more students to continue with their studies to higher level mathematics.  In fact, State Examinations Commission data highlights that for the 2011 leaving certificate examinations there were 9,950 candidates entered, with 7,917 sitting the examination.  This year the number of candidates entered stood at 12,510, which is an increase of approximately 25%.  I look forward to finding out how many of these entrants will present and I hope the majority of them do so.</P>
        <P>On the sciences at senior cycle, it must be noted that participation in physics, chemistry and applied mathematics has been relatively stable in the past three years.  The numbers participating in agricultural science increased from 4,164 in 2009 to 5,287 last year, while the numbers participating in biology increased from 20,102 to 22,677 in the same period.</P>
        <P>An important element of the strategy for science, technology and innovation is to increase the proportions of students studying the physical sciences in senior cycle.  Revised draft syllabuses in physics, chemistry and biology have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment following consultations with the key stakeholders.  The revised syllabuses aim to provide a strong focus on practical investigative approaches and practical assessment as a follow on from the changes introduced at junior cycle science in 2003.  It is expected that these syllabuses will be submitted to the Department later this year.</P>
        <P>This year, there has been a significant number of students applying through the Central Applications Office for science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses.  The number of students expressing a first preference for science courses, including computing, at honours degree level &mdash; level 8 &mdash; increased by 18.4% this year and over the five year period from 2008 to 2012, the figure increased by a total of 63.5%.  First preferences for agricultural science increased by 98%.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment provided its advice to me on junior cycle reform in late 2011.  Ongoing consideration is being given to implementation of this reform, which will be introduced on a phased basis.  All the existing subjects, including mathematics and science, are being continued and schools will also be able to provide their students with short course options.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to entry into third level courses.  The Department must examine the fairness or otherwise of entry requirements.  For example, a student can enter a third level science course having studied only one science subject and ordinary level mathematics at leaving certificate level.  He or she will be in a class with other students who will have taken physics, applied and honours mathematics, chemistry and biology in the leaving certificate.  The Department should examine drop-out rates from science courses.  My experience of studying at university was that many students drop out of science courses after first year.  In many cases, these students were badly advised when they chose science in University College Dublin, University College Cork, the Dublin Institute of Technology or another third level college.  We need to be straight with students who have taken only one science subject in the leaving certificate and inform them that they will be at a disadvantage if they study science at university.</P>
        <P>The Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, employers and the trade union movement have an opportunity to demonstrate that science and technology offer many job opportunities.  In Limerick, for example, we have had job announcements in areas such as cloud computing.  Unless we provide the appropriate educational infrastructure at primary, secondary and tertiary level, we will not be in a position to benefit from job opportunities in the technology sector.  We must ask the reason so many young people are either not studying technology subjects or are dropping out of science courses.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, a great deal of work needs to be done on this issue.  All the stakeholders should be encouraged to engage in constructive dialogue with a view to increasing participation rates in science and mathematics at secondary and tertiarylevel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I wholeheartedly agree with all the points the Deputy makes.  While we have made a significant start to the process of improving understanding of mathematics generally, we have a long way to go in that regard.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills, I have been informed repeatedly by individuals involved in information technology and computing that the sector is experiencing significant skills shortages.  Many of those in the industry impress on me that people do not need to have a computer science degree, master&rsquo;s degree or PhD to secure employment in the sector.  A significant number of vacancies have arisen for people who do not have in-depth knowledge of information and communications technology.  Many opportunities are presenting for young unemployed people to engage in training for six months to one year which would allow them to pursue sustainable, long-term careers in the ICT and computing sector.</P>
        <P>I concur with Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan that we need to examine the teaching of mathematics across primary, post-primary and tertiary education.  I was fortunate to meet a number of social entrepreneurs from all over the world at a recent event in Dublin Castle called Change Nation.  I was particularly taken with one gentleman, Dr. John Mighten, a teacher of mathematics in Canada who has devised a new way of teaching maths in Canadian schools known as JUMP Math.  The Deputy may wish to browse the very interesting JUMP Math website.  Dr. Mighten&rsquo;s system recognises that all children have talents when it comes to understanding mathematics and seeks to avoid coming to conclusions, as has happened in many schools, much too early in the lives of children that they are either good or bad at mathematics.  He takes the view that we are all very good at mathematics initially and if this talent is nurtured, we can remain good at maths for our entire lives.</P>
        <P>I am examining the JUMP Math programme and working with a number of individuals in NUIG to ascertain whether it would be possible to roll out one or two pilot projects for the programme.  The results in Canada, the United States and Brixton in the United Kingdom have been astounding and I look forward to applying them in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to raise this issue.  While I do not raise many matters in Topical Issue debates, this is an issue that is close to my heart.  Having visited Scoil Mhuire national school in Meelick, County Clare, I can only describe the conditions I saw at the school as absolutely appalling.  It is difficult to understand how the previous Government ignored the school and allowed conditions to deteriorate to such an extent, especially during the Celtic tiger period when the country was awash with money.  Every area of the school building and its environs is in need of urgent attention.  Running repairs are no longer sufficient to deal with the scale of the problems at the school and maintenance is costing the board of management a fortune.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to keep up with the number of water leaks at the school, especially from roofs in the prefabricated buildings.  I saw buckets and basins in several classrooms and there is a major concern that the leaks pose a fire hazard given that water penetrated the fluorescent bulb fixtures in ceilings on a number of occasions.  Water has also caused structural damage to ceilings in the school&rsquo;s prefabricated buildings.  The ceilings and foundations of these buildings need to be replaced.</P>
        <P>The school has little ventilation because windows cannot be opened as their frames are swollen.  This lack of ventilation gives rise to significant safety concerns and is not good for the health of the children or teachers.  The main doorframe is unsteady and poses a health and safety risk.  All the windows and doors need to be replaced.</P>
        <P>Mould is visible on the walls of several classrooms and washrooms, the sewage system is not working properly and there is a foul smell in the toilets where the roof is leaking.  There is also water on the floor and junior and senior infants do not have access to hot water in their classrooms which also have leaks in the ceilings.  The permanent odour of damp in the school is a matter of serious concern to the school and parents as a number of children suffer from asthma and other respiratory related illnesses.</P>
        <P>When I walked into the yard I noticed a number of structural problems with the school building.  I observed, for example, that a number of roof slates were missing and several more were loose.  The school yard surface is cracked, eroded and uneven and several potholes are visible.  Manholes are rusted, dangerous and overflowing.  The gradient in one part of the play area is so bad that teachers must constantly monitor the children to avoid serious injury.</P>
        <P>Teachers are not to blame for conditions at the school and have done their best.  The problem is that the school is old, having been built in 1959 in what was then a small locality.  The school is located in the Stonepark area near the church.  In the 1980s, many housing estates sprung up on the other side of the parish in the Ballycannon area and the population of the village increased.  This also boosted the school population and the school now has eight teachers and 150 pupils, with a further 23 children due to enrol in September.</P>
        <P>I visited a number of schools in County Clare in recent months and the conditions in Meelick school were the worst I saw.   Stop gap measures or sticking plaster solutions are not sufficient to deal with the enormous problem in the school itself.  Remedial works are carried out by the school on an ongoing basis, but the scale of the problem is beyond the ability of the school authority to maintain or fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Can the Minister of State give me an update on the situation?  The school has applied for emergency funding because it poses a health and safety risk.  A risk assessment has been carried out by a qualified consultant, who has confirmed that the works are urgently required so that the school and its grounds can be made safe for the children and parents who use it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this topical issue debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position regarding the allocation of funding under the Department&rsquo;s emergency works scheme and, in particular, the applications received from the management authority of Scoil Mhuire national school, Meelick, County Clare.  Application forms and guidelines for this scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website advising schools on how to apply for emergency funding, and also outlining the terms and conditions of the emergency works scheme.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The purpose of the emergency works scheme is solely for unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to the health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  It is not intended that the emergency works scheme will be used to supplement previous applications under other schemes or to replace any other schemes provided by my Department.</P>
       <P>The management authority of Scoil Mhuire national school, Meelick, County Clare, has submitted two applications under the emergency works scheme.  The first of these was received on  8 July 2011, seeking funding to refurbish pupil and staff toilets in the school, and this was refused as it was outside the scope of the scheme.  The second application was received on 18 February 2012, seeking funding to replace the roofs on both the permanent school building and the prefabricated building on the school site, completely resurface the hard play areas and carry out remedial works to sewer and surface water lines at the school.</P>
        <P>On 1 March 2012, an official from my Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit contacted both the school authority and its consultant and informed them that the scale of the works was outside the scope of the scheme.  The school authority was requested to identify the most urgent works required at the school and to reapply for these works in a scaled down scope of works, that is, to carry out repair work to the areas of roofs currently leaking and to identify the emergency works required to the sewerage system.  Any such application will be given due consideration.</P>
        <P>The school authority submitted a revised scope of works on 8 March 2012, but as the works requested for funding were still outside the type of works that would be funded under the emergency works scheme, the school authority was again informed that its application was not successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this issue, but I am still not satisfied with the answer I am getting today.  Perhaps the Minister of State might chase up the history of previous applications.  If it is outside the scope of the scheme, I fail to understand the problem.  As far as I am concerned, every part of the school requires urgent attention.  What happens if there is a fire in the school in the morning and windows cannot be opened?  It is just awful.  I am not just saying this to try to influence the Minister of State, but it is urgent and there are safety fears here.</P>
        <P>Can the school management apply for another scheme to deal with these ongoing problems?  There are structural problems, electrical problems, problems with the roof, dampness and mould.  Very little money has been spent on permanent structures in this school.  It is an old type of school, built back in 1959.  Many other schools in the area have improved, but this school has been left behind and I am extremely worried for the children, the teachers and the parents, who are also concerned about these issues.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to come back to me on this.  Perhaps he could visit the school in his capacity as Minister of State.  It needs urgent attention.  He might let me know where the school is in the Department&rsquo;s building programme for the construction of permanent structures or improvements.   If the school is outside this scheme, what other scheme can it apply for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On 1 March, an official from the building unit contacted the school and the school was requested to identify the most urgent works required and to apply for those works in a scaled down scope, to carry out works to the parts of roofs that are currently leaking and identify the issues raised by the Deputy in respect of the sewerage system.  The building unit officials have told me that they are prepared to consider any application for funding that will address the most urgent needs of Scoil Mhuire national school.  I think it is incumbent upon the board of management to identify the most urgent needs and if it succeeds in doing that and makes a submission to the building unit, such a submission may be looked on in a favourable light.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this matter.  The issue of the prisoners in Maghaberry Prison has been long neglected and is getting very little publicity.  We are not talking about the political views of these prisoners, but the human rights conditions in which they have been held for quite a while.  I will discuss the case of Marion Price, while Deputy Pringle will speak about two other prisoners.</P>
        <P>Until February, Marion Price was held practically in solitary confinement in an all male prison.  She has now been moved to a so-called health centre, which I do not believe is addressing her health issues.  There are questions about the lawfulness of her detention and the term &ldquo;administrative internment&rdquo; is also being used.  She was re-arrested when she was out on bail on the order of the Secretary of State, so I think there are issues here about the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>I followed up on prisoner rights and human rights issues for prisoners in China, Iran and Bahrain recently, and then I discovered that this was an issue just 100 km up the road.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice and Equality in January, who told me that the T&aacute;naiste was in discussions with the Minister of State in Northern Ireland.  I then followed that with two questions to the T&aacute;naiste and the gist of his response was that the situation was being monitored.  More definite detail is needed on this.  What exactly is going on?  Does the T&aacute;naiste feel that he has role on a prisoner rights and human rights issue up the road in Northern Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has outlined, this is a very important human rights issue on the island of Ireland that we need to address.  Many Members have been quick to raise issues in Tibet, China and elsewhere, but we need to be cognisant of what is happening on our own island to Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>There is an agreement in Maghaberry between the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland and the prisoners that will resolve the protests that have been going on there for the last few years, but the Northern Ireland Prison Service refuses to implement that agreement.  This means that the conditions under the prisoners have to live are continuing.  I impress on the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, the need to make forceful representations to the Minister for Justice in the Six Counties, and to the Northern Ireland Prison Service, to ensure that this agreement is implemented so that the protest can be ended and the prisoners can complete their sentences in some sort of dignity.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the specific case of Brian Shivers, who is currently being held in Maghaberry as well, awaiting appeal for a conviction that he received a few months ago.  Mr. Shivers suffers from cystic fibrosis and he is 46 years old.  Life expectancy in the UK for sufferers of cystic fibrosis is 39 years, so he has already exceeded that.  He has been denied medical treatment in Maghaberry Prison for the last six weeks by the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The service has refused to give him his medication so he can alleviate his condition, and it is a very serious issue for an Irish citizen to be held in those conditions.  There is correspondence from the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, which has agreed to offer training to prison staff to administer his medication in a proper manner, but this has not been availed of to date.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste on 20 April in relation to this issue but, as yet, I have not even received an acknowledgment from him.  It is vitally important that these matters be brought up forcefully.  On human rights grounds, prisoners should be treated with respect and dignity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank both Deputies for putting the case for prisoners&rsquo; conditions in Maghaberry Prison so succinctly.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware of a number of concerns which have been expressed regarding human rights conditions of prisoners currently being held in Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste has raised the issue with authorities in Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, most recently on 27 April with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, and on 20 April with the Minister of Justice in the Northern Ireland Assembly, David Ford.</P>
        <P>There are a number of ongoing issues concerning a group of prisoners held in a separated prisoners&rsquo; regime in Maghaberry.  This group has been on dirty protest since May 2011 over conditions and practices in the prison, particularly the use of full body searches.  This is a highly contentious and emotive issue and I understand that concerted efforts have been made to facilitate an agreement which would see a regime put in place acceptable to all parties.  Recent incidents in Maghaberry Prison have made these efforts more difficult, as any agreement would need to balance the security concerns of the prison authorities with the issues raised by the prisoners.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent announcement by Minister Ford that full body scanner devices are to be used in a trial pilot scheme in Maghaberry Prison.  The use of such technology might address the concerns of prisoners regarding a full body search regime.</P>
        <P>In a wider context, huge progress has been made by the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Prison Service in relation to implementing the recommendations of the Owers report for prison reform.  This report outlined a series of reforms which will fundamentally change how prisons are operated and organised in Northern Ireland.  The report team undertook a 360 degree review of the prison system and had a very strong focus on how best to protect the human rights of prisoners.  Minister Ford, in a recent conversation with the T&aacute;naiste, spoke positively of how the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations was progressing and there is no doubt as to his commitment to reforming the prison services to the benefit of all stakeholders.  The full implementation of the Owers report will be the most effective way to ensure that human rights of all prisoners in Northern Ireland, not just in Maghaberry Prison, are fully observed.</P>
        <P>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials have been instructed to continue to monitor any further developments on these issues.  The Government will continue to take an active interest in this subject and will make appropriate representations where necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the reply, but it is disappointing.  I am sure the Minister of State is also disappointed because I know of his role in prisoners&rsquo; issues in Dublin Central and with my predecessor, the late Tony Gregory.</P>
        <P>The Pat Finucane Centre, which is a non-party political and anti-sectarian human rights group committed to the non-violent resolution of conflict situations has taken these issues up and has been in touch with the T&aacute;naiste.  I wonder if he has responded to the centre.</P>
        <P>Terms like &ldquo;aware of&rdquo;, &ldquo;raised issues&rdquo; and &ldquo;continue to monitor&rdquo; sound very nice but there is no action behind them.  Meanwhile the situation in Maghaberry has been ongoing for almost a year.  Reforms are never worth the paper they are written on unless they are implemented.  From the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer it sounds as though these issues are being kicked to touch.  There has been reform and a report and everything is going to be fine, but in the meantime there are serious health and human rights issues for the prisoners.</P>
        <P>We did not mention another prisoner, Gerry McGeough, and I know there are others besides the three we mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, I am disappointed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  A sense of urgency needs to be impressed on Department officials when they are dealing with their counterparts in the Six Counties to ensure the reforms are implemented without delay.</P>
        <P>The introduction of full body scanners might go some way to relieving the conditions in Maghaberry, particularly for prisoners who are strip searched on numerous occasions on days when they receive several visits.  That should not be allowed to continue in any civilised society.  It merely heightens the sense of conflict and deteriorates the situation even further.</P>
        <P>I ask that the T&aacute;naiste make representations regarding Brian Chivers.  His life is at risk due to his illness and his life expectancy will be curtailed by the conditions in which he is being forced to live.  He is being denied life-saving and life-maintaining medical treatment.  That is not acceptable in this country in this day and age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I take on board what the Deputies said.  I will speak to the T&aacute;naiste about the matter.  He spoke to the Minister for Justice, David Ford, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, in April.  I will bring the issues the Deputies raised to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to discuss the individual cases the Deputies mentioned.  I appreciate the necessity to take early action regarding the medical situation referred to.  I hope there can be an early resolution to these matters.  We do not want to go back from the Good Friday Agreement.  There is still dissident activity in Northern Ireland and in the prison context, but we want to get overall agreement.  I understand the authorities in Northern Ireland are seeking to get that agreement.</P>
        <P>I will speak to the T&aacute;naiste about the matter and encourage him to bring his good offices to bear to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

        <P Just="Left">In 2006, the A Vision for Change report on mental health policy estimated that up to 200,000 people in Ireland may be affected by an eating disorder, whether anorexia nervosa, bulimia, binge eating disorder or otherwise.  It also reported that approximately 400 new cases of eating disorder are diagnosed each year in Ireland which, shockingly, represents approximately 80 deaths per year.</P>
        <P>A Government study of children and adolescents carried out in 2006 indicated that 1.2% of Irish girls are at risk of developing anorexia nervosa and 2% are at risk of developing bulimia.  Figures from the Health Research Board report on the activities of Irish psychiatric units in hospitals indicate that eating disorders represented the second highest level of diagnosis, at 18%, of child and adolescent psychiatric admissions in 2008.  There are also worrying trends internationally.  A study of Scottish secondary school students reported that approximately a quarter of boys and girls had engaged in bulimic or anorexic behaviour.</P>
        <P>Eating disorders, as a psychiatric condition, have a significant mortality rate.  A 1995 study in the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i>, shockingly, found that &ldquo;aggregate annual mortality rates associated with anorexia are more than 12 times higher than the annual death rate due to all causes for females aged between 15 and 24 and more than 200 times higher than the suicide rate of females in the general population&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This issue that does not predominantly affect girls and women, as the incidence of men who are affected by eating disorders is significantly on the rise.  International studies estimate that as many as 25% of patients being treated for anorexia and bulimia are male and perhaps 50% of binge eating disorder cases are men.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of these astonishing statistics have been compiled and highlighted by the outstanding campaigning organisation for victims of eating disorders, Bodywhys, led by Ms Jacinta Hastings.  Many colleagues in the House, attended the excellent briefings provided by Ms Hastings during eating disorders awareness week in February and her follow-up briefings.</P>
        <P>One of the most incredible facts surrounding eating disorders services is that there are only three beds in the public health system specifically designated for citizens with an eating disorder.  Many patients approach their GP, and the Minister has emphasised that the treatment of eating disorders by community mental health teams is the best way forward.  Bodywhys and other health professionals, however, believe there is an urgent need for at least 24 beds in the public health system to adequately treat the needs of the growing number of citizens with an eating disorder.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recommendation 15.4.7 of A Vision for Change proposes in each HSE region an eating disorder sub-unit in a regional general hospital mental health unit with six beds each, which would contribute 24 public eating disorder beds.  What can the Minister promise or what can he indicate will happen in this area?  There is also a clear issue of equality at stake.  With just three public beds, is it the case that only citizens who can afford private treatment will be able to access treatment for an eating disorder?  There are many outstanding eating disorder counsellors and psychotherapists working in this country but it is an unregulated sector.  As Bodywhys emphasises, citizens seeking treatment for an eating disorder are in an exceptionally vulnerable position.  It is therefore essential that the areas of counselling and psychotherapy are strictly regulated to the highest standards.  There is an opportunity for regulation, either by statutory instrument or by the introduction of legislation to the House.  I urge the Minister to introduce regulations urgently in this regard and to ensure standards for counsellors and psychotherapists are provided either through legislation or by a statutory instrument.  I seek a commitment from the Minister that eating disorder services will be introduced as a matter of urgency, as outlined in A Vision for Change, given the dramatic effect of eating disorders on young people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important matter for discussion today.  I am responding to this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for mental health issues.  Health Service Executive, HSE, services for people with eating disorders are embedded in the main in the community mental health service and primary care.  Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to the primary care practitioner with complications of their condition and early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.  The HSE has developed a mental health in primary care accredited training programme with Dublin City University for primary care practitioners, with a view to enhancing the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses, including eating disorders, within the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>Community based adult mental health services receive referrals from primary care and provide assessment and treatment to individuals with eating disorders.  Child and adolescent mental health teams provide a similar role for their cohort of referrals.  Where the individual&rsquo;s psychiatric or medical needs are more acute, inpatient admission is offered within the local psychiatric services or acute medical care where necessary.  The HSE can and has worked with service providers in the independent sector to provide specialised care, on an inpatient and-or an outpatient basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Services for persons with eating orders are also provided in the voluntary sector and in this regard I should mention that the HSE provides funding to Bodywhys, the national voluntary organisation supporting those with eating disorders.  Bodywhys provides a range of support services for people affected by eating disorders, including specific services for families and friends.  As the House will be aware, a special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided in budget 2012 for mental health.  The funding will be used primarily to strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services, by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  More than 400 additional staff will be recruited to support initiatives under the &euro;35 million package.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes.  Three areas in particular will be prioritised in 2012, one of which will be around the treatment and care of patients with eating disorders.  These programmes are currently being finalised.</P>
        <P>On the regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors, the priority of the Department of Health for the foreseeable future is the statutory registration of the conventional therapies, through the full establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  Before statutory registration can be considered for other therapies, such as counselling and psychotherapy, there is a need for each individual therapy to federate so that it can advise, as a single voice, on professional standards.  That was a recommendation of the report of the national working group on the regulation of complementary therapists.  The Higher Education and Training Awards Council is currently working with representatives of the professional bodies and higher education institutions that provide courses in counselling and psychotherapy, along with international experts, to determine national standards of knowledge, skill and competence to be required for the award of higher education qualifications in these fields.  While academic qualifications are not sufficient in themselves as a means of professional regulation, agreement on academic standards does form a critical building block for any modern regulatory system for professions.  I trust this clarifies the issues for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending and for his reply.  We all welcome the allocation of the &euro;35 million secured through the budget by our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for mental health services. The question is, however, whether it will lead to more acute beds in front line services.  That is one of the main points of today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>I have liaised with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the problem with psychiatric services for 16 year olds and 17 year olds.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the issue.  I welcome the point made by the Minister on the certification of psychotherapists and counsellors.  As outlined by him on the second page of his reply, however, it appears to be a lengthy process.  Is there some way the Minister could take decisive legislative action either by administrative means or otherwise to ensure the process is accelerated?</P>
        <P>An issue of fairness arises in terms of the current provision.  The Minister mentioned that some independent providers have been licensed to offer services but the fact remains that families on lower incomes will not be able to access them.  There is still a clear requirement for additional beds.</P>
        <P>Education is a major issue, both for the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in terms of self-perception and people being accepting of different body types.  I recently heard the Minister speak forcefully about smoking.  He made a strong case on health grounds.  I commend him on his interest in this major issue.  Perhaps this is another area in which the Department could put its shoulder to the wheel in terms of education.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor raised the issue of websites which seem to promote anorexia and bulimia.  I am concerned about the action that should be taken in this regard.  I note the French Government has taken decisive action &mdash; the government there might change on Sunday to the benefit of all of us in this House.  Does the Minister propose to take action against people who are causing harm?  I accept he did respond previously to Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor on the matter, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy opposite for his comments on the additional resources made available by the Government for mental health issues.  It is an area to which the Government is very committed.  The Taoiseach is also very interested in it.  More work remains to be done in terms of having more organisation around specific beds for the treatment of eating disorders.  Currently, as Deputy Broughan outlined, there are a number of designated beds but other beds are also used for the treatment of such conditions.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Broughan, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I are concerned about the changes that occurred <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the law on the age of a child, which increased from 16 years to 18 years and the difficulties that created in terms of the provision of proper psychiatric and psychological services for children in that age group.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about regulation.  The printed reply might have referred to the future but I am aware the change must be more urgent.  There is a real need for GPs and community nurses in particular, and other professionals, to be confident they are referring individuals who need counselling, whether for an eating disorder or otherwise, to properly qualified and competent individuals.  The regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists is very much on my agenda.  As I outlined, we are currently organising issues around ancillary health professionals but I also want to address the issue of other therapists.  I believe there is a real role for people in this area but there is a need to protect patients and ensure they are going, and the referring physician, nurse or clinician can have the confidence that he or she is referring, to a suitably qualified person.</P>
        <P>I note the issue of education in this area.  Certainly, that requires more co-operation between ourselves and the Department.</P>
        <P>The other issue about websites and licensing is something I will discuss with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we should raise that as well with the Ministers, Deputies Fitzgerald and Shatter, on a cross-departmental basis.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Broughan pointed out, it is an area of real concern.  It is a difficult area to treat for professionals.  If intervention occurs early, the bulk of cases can be handled without admission to hospital, but there are occasions when that is required.  Certainly, we will look into how we can better organise that facility in a more specialised way.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will reconsider the proposal to introduce water meters and water charges as metering is not an option for one third of households in Dublin.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22569/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>The Government considers charging based on usage the fairest way to charge for water and has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption, and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.</P>
        <P>My Department estimates there are approximately 1.35 million domestic properties connected to public water supplies in Ireland.  Following detailed analysis of available data, it is estimated that up to 300,000 of these households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty in doing so.  It is not true to say these households will never be metered.  I expect these households will be metered in the longer term as shared service connections are replaced and further options relating to metering apartment blocks are evaluated, including internal metering.  Households which are not initially metered will pay for water on an assessed basis.</P>
        <P>Detailed cost estimates on the metering programme have been prepared by my Department.  It would not be appropriate to release these estimates in advance of the competitive procurement process.  I am aware of some estimates of the cost of metering which have been reported in the media in recent months.  These estimates are speculative and will be shown to be significantly overstated when the procurement of metering is completed.  The metering programme will begin before the end of 2012 and will be substantially delivered within a three year period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to customers.  My Department is working with the commission on the development of the regulatory framework for the water sector, and legislation will be prepared to provide the commission with the necessary powers to fulfil its new role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>In the likely event the Minister&rsquo;s target number of houses will not be metered by 2014, what is his plan B for the project?  Will he address the anomaly in the units to which he referred which cannot be metered in the short term because there is a disparity?  The Minister quotes a figure of 300,000 units and the House will be aware what the executive engineer from Dublin City Council has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent census figures on which we can rely state that apartments, bed-sits and pre-1960 buildings combined come to a figure of 503,000 units.  There is a fairly large discrepancy between the figure the Minister quotes and the figure the CSO quotes.  Can the Minister elaborate on his statement that the units that cannot be metered in the short term would be charged on an assessed basis?  Will they be means-tested?  Will it be a flat rate charge?  Can the Minister give Members any more detail on it?  Can the Minister give the public who will face the wider metering project and the rest of us any idea on the structure of the free allocation and the pricing structure per litre above the free allocation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of households that would not be metered was looked at in the context of the census data, the same as it was by those others whom Deputy Niall Collins mentioned, including the executive manager of Dublin City Council.  We all were looking at the same figures.  We have done a detailed analysis in the Department on the number of properties that will cause problems in the initial phase of metering.  It is important to note that this figure is an estimate and it will be higher or lower.  It is intended that each property will be individually examined for suitability for metering as part of the roll-out of the metering programme.</P>
        <P>Deputy Niall Collins mentioned the media reports that one third of the houses will not be metered.  My Department&rsquo;s analysis of the available data of property has taken into account the matters raised in the media reports, and where conventional metering installation is not possible, it is intended that alternative approaches will be considered, including a flat rate charge based on similar water usage in similar properties.  For example, for housing units in apartment complexes, internal metering may be considered.  Irish Water will be expected to ensure the maximum level of metering is achieved.  It should fully evaluate the options for the properties where conventional meter installation will not be feasible.</P>
        <P>The free allowance and the water pricing matters are the subject of an implementation plan, where Bord G&aacute;is, which is the semi-State company put in charge of rolling out this project, in consultation with the regulator, will bring proposals to the Department and Government shortly.  Bord G&aacute;is is the company the Government is charging on behalf of the customer with responsibility to come to it with views about the free allowance.  The Government will decide at the end of the day, in line with the programme for Government, on the free allowance and the amount that will be allowed in this case.  On water pricing, we will be getting the proposals from Bord G&aacute;is and the regulator on these matters as well in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Then we discuss them together.  Deputy Stanley should ask his question and then I will let Deputy Niall Collins in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that there are in excess of 300,000 households that cannot be metered.  The Dublin position has been mentioned, but would the Minister agree that this will also be a problem throughout the country?</P>
        <P>Where there are apartments, the Minister mentioned fitting internal meters.  What would happen in an apartment block where the occupants might not want meters fitted?  Would somebody break down the doors?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what they used to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>What would happen in the case of old housing estates in Carlow-Kilkenny, of which the Minister will be aware, and in many places throughout the State where there are pipes running at the back of houses, under garden sheds and under garden walls?  Would one have to bulldoze one&rsquo;s way through garden sheds to try to get at these stopcocks to fit meters?  These are real problems I am trying to point out to the Minister.  I am trying to save him much head-on confrontation with residents.  There will be many problems in trying to fit these.  The senior engineer in Dublin City Council set out his stall in terms of the number of households in Dublin that cannot be fitted with meters, and he would know a thing or two about meters.</P>
        <P>The Minister might address this issue.  I have heard reports of these meters being installed in 18 months or two years.  Is the Minister aware that across the water in England, there are parts that have not yet got meters?  I spoke to somebody who worked in water services in England for ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>That person told me that in their duration with Anglian Water, the company had not succeeded in completing the fitting of water meters in that time.  Is the Minister aware of that?  It would appear to be unworkable and impossible.  Even if the Minister succeeds in having interior meters installed in apartment blocks, charging a flat fee flies in the face of the stated aim of this measure which is to conserve water.  That argument does not stack up when one looks at the figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that if he is making a linkage between water metering and water conservation, a flat fee proposal is not in line with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised that Deputy Stanley would question a proposal to charge for any service considering that the average water charge per household in Northern Ireland equates to almost &euro;1,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is absolutely wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The exact figure is &euro;971.  I am aware this is a sensitive issue for the Deputy given that Sinn F&eacute;in purports to be all-island party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>Householders in the North have access to free rural transport, free fire services and much more besides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be allowed to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also surprised that the Deputy would take the word of an executive manager of one local authority above the very detailed analysis carried out by my Department on a nationwide basis.</P>
        <P>I have acknowledged there will be difficulties in respect of the installation of meters in a certain cohort of properties.  I will not be out there installing them myself, no more than the Deputy will, but we are putting people in a position of responsibility to do that job.  Approximately 200 contracts will be tendered and granted before the end of the year by the semi-State body charged with responsibility for the scheme.  The installation programme will create 2,000 jobs.  There is no question of it being necessary for one contract to finish before the next can proceed.  Rather, the 200 contracts will be ongoing at the same time.  These are the means by which we will speed up the implementation of the scheme.  A public water utility, Irish Water, will be established for the purposes of implementation.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that will arise, which I have acknowledged, let us give it the opportunity to fulfil its task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister to outline his plan B given that I am not convinced that his Department appreciates the complexity of the project being undertaken.  All informed third-party commentators are of the view that the programme will not meet its deadline of the end of 2014.  There is a discrepancy between the figures from the 2011 census and those contained in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which relied on the 2006 census data.  This has led to the uncertainty as to whether 300,000 or in excess of 500,000 units will not be included in the initial metering programme.  Does the Minister have a plan B if the deadline is not met at the end of 2014?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the Deputy&rsquo;s lack of confidence in a decision made by the Government to charge a semi-State company with what is the largest project since the establishment of the ESB, namely, to ensure the provision of water supplies in adequate quantities and quality for the people of this country.  I would have expected him to support that objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of support or otherwise.  It is reasonable to ask whether there is a plan B in the event that the deadline is not met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected his support given that scheme is in line with a decision made by the previous Government in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>That has nothing to do with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Collins must allow the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for a plan B.  We have made the decision to charge a semi-State body with carrying out this important work for the benefit of the people of this country.  Let us give it an opportunity, through an implementation plan, to do so.  Any talk of a plan B amounts to scaremongering.  We are proceeding with plan A.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no scaremongering.  People are entitled to certainty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>They will have certainty.</P>

	<P>What is the situation in regard to households which have already installed meters?  Does the Minister agree that all of the money being invested in the installation of meters will do nothing to fix the leaks in piping systems?  Surely it would be more effective, instead of proceeding with metering, to repair those faults and roll out the neighbourhood metering system on a national basis?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;200 million has been spent in the past six or seven years on the rehabilitation of mains and pipe networks, with an additional &euro;120 million allocated for this purpose this year and next.  I am surprised the Deputy is not supporting this water conservation programme.  I am in support of clean water, but one can only conclude, on the basis of his attitude to the septic tank provisions, that he is opposed to it.  The reality is that water leakage on the customer side is not being caught, with substantial losses arising in all local authority areas.  That is totally unacceptable.  Our objective is to address this issue by eliminating fragmentation and establishing a single public water utility to deal with these matters once.  That will ensure we have adequate quantities of quality water for consumers, particularly on the east coast where a water shortage will develop if we do not plan for it now.  I am determined, together with Bord G&aacute;is and my Government colleagues, that we will do this in the shortest period of time, notwithstanding the difficulties and hiccups that will inevitably arise along the way.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will accept that in view of the information available (details supplied), the Building Regulations Advisory Board could have prevented the pyrite problem by ensuring adequate testing standards and that he has a responsibility and duty to the thousands of home owners, who invested in their family home believing that the building regulations were a protection against major structural damage, to remediate the major structural damage caused by the failure of the BRAB and his Department.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22284/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on legally enforceable minimum requirements, as set out in the building regulations.  Detailed technical guidance documents, TGDs, accompanying each part of the building regulations outline how compliance can be achieved in practice.  The regulations and relevant TGDs first came into effect in June 1992.  They are subject to ongoing review by my Department, working in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body, BRAB, in light of developments in the construction industry generally.</P>
        <P>My Department first became aware of the pyrite problem in mid-2007, and, in conjunction with the BRAB, took appropriate and decisive action to deal with the emerging problem and prevent the use of pyritic material in future.  All building control authorities were advised of the problem and their co-operation sought in the enforcement of the relevant building regulations.  Industry stakeholders were also contacted and advised of the problem and their assistance sought in containing it.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, in conjunction with my Department and industry stakeholders, undertook a review of existing guidance in regard to hardcore material and, following a public consultation process, issued additional guidance, standard recommendation SR21, on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in material fill for use under concrete floors in dwellings and other buildings.  Technical guidance document C was revised in 2008 to take account of the additional guidance given in SR21.</P>
        <P>Acknowledging the very difficult and challenging situation faced by home owners having to cope with the consequences of pyrite problems in their homes, I set up the pyrite panel in September 2011 whose remit is to identify solutions for a resolution to the pyrite problem.  I look forward to receiving its report shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s response is factually inaccurate in several instances.  He acknowledges that the regulations were inadequate and had to be changed.  The issue, however, is whether he was aware of the problem at that time.  There is now indisputable evidence, given most recently at a symposium in Trinity College, that there was a massive awareness of this issue in terms of the ground engineering literature that was in circulation at the time and the geology of the area.  It is indisputable that the information was out there and, as such, the building regulations should have ensured adequate testing to deal with it.  Had that been in place, the nightmare scenario now facing families would not have arisen.  Will the Minister respond to that point?  His officials attended that symposium and have had it confirmed that the industry knew that testing should have been done, not least for sulphur attacks on concrete.  The Department did not do that and although this  was before the Minister&rsquo;s time, it remains the case that the Department is responsible for overseeing the building regulations.  Given that it has been acknowledged as deficient in this regard, the Minister must take responsibility to remedy the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, there was court action in regard to this matter and the Department was exonerated of any particular responsibility.  The pyrite symposium to which the Deputy referred was organised by Professor Brian Hawkins, a former member of staff at the University of Bristol.  He has an engineering and geological background and has been involved in a number of isolated pyrite-related incidents in the United Kingdom over a number of years.  He has also had an involvement with the pyrite problem in Ireland since 2007.  Four members of my departmental staff who provide technical and administrative support to the pyrite panel attended the symposium to which the Deputy referred and reported back to the pyrite panel yesterday.  In response to a question from a member of the Pyrite Action Group as to whether the knowledge of pyrite was common prior to 2007, Professor Hawkins indicated that it was, referring to several academic papers and a book of his which dealt with pyritic heave.  Paul Forde, joint managing director of DBFL Consulting Engineers, gave a presentation at the symposium on his experience of dealing with pyrite problems since 2007.  He indicated he was not aware of pyrite prior to 2007 and had misdiagnosed cracking resulting from pyritic heave when he was initially engaged to deal with problems.  The general view among engineering professionals is that there was very little knowledge of pyrite prior to 2007.  It is not covered in third level engineering courses.  Hardcore was seen as a low risk material.  The question takes a narrow and selective view of what was said at that symposium.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>If the pyrite panel comes back with a finding that makes points like those the Minister is making, the householders affected are going to be seriously disappointed.  The Minister must understand the nature of the problem to come up with a solution and he has quoted two people&rsquo;s different opinions.  Mr. Brian Hawkins is the world renowned authority on pyrite and I would give greater credibility to his opinion.  He absolutely confirmed on at least ten occasions at the symposium that this was known about and society should have acknowledged this.  It should have been reflected in the regulations.  Unless the Department takes responsibility for that, there will be a real problem when the panel issues its findings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Daly should acknowledge, I have done everything possible to engage with Oireachtas Members and people through this pyrite panel to ensure solutions are on offer, not a blame game.  If the Deputy wants to go down the road of a blame game, she will not find solutions for ordinary people.  In recent litigation that led me to establish this pyrite panel, it was clearly stated the Department was not in any way culpable in these matters.  People will have differences of opinion in all walks of life; I am interested in getting solutions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  if any changes have been made to payment methods for the household charge in response to the payment rate to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22283/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system, <i>www.householdcharge.ie</i>, is in place in the Local Government Management Agencym LGMA, to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit or debit card.   In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, or credit or debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments were available before 1 March 2012 for those who wished to pay in four instalments.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.</P>
        <P>A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service-agency basis for all local authorities.  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis.  In addition, 178,000 postal applications have been received in the household charge bureau, which are now being processed and this work will be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there are comprehensive suites of payment options available to persons to pay the household charge and I have no proposals to introduce changes to the payment options currently available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The people who have not paid the household charge to date can be placed in one of two categories: those who have a principled objection and those with a clear inability to pay.  The campaign to date lacked information.  There were insufficient payment methods and there has been a series of incoherent messages from the Government about payment through An Post.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister make provision for those with a clear inability to pay?  There are genuine people who see these extra charges mounting up.  It is acknowledged that the charge is regressive and the nature of the flat rate means there are unemployed people and old age pensioners with a genuine inability to pay.  Will the Minister consider at some stage making provision for these people?  There was a proposal to extend the payment deadline to September to avoid putting thousands of people outside the law.  The Minister should consider that.</P>
        <P>There are many unfinished housing estates that are not categorised as qualifying for the waiver.  What process exists for residents&rsquo; associations to contact the Department or local authority?  There is no visible process.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s strategy for dealing with those household that have not paid?  Just about 50% have paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>So far 57% have paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure has stopped climbing.  Just over 40% have not paid and I am making the case for those who cannot pay.  What is the strategy for dealing with those who can pay but refuse to pay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>All the doomsday people on the back row opposite said only 20% would pay.  I know it does not suit Deputy Daly&rsquo;s argument but 57% have paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not bother me in the slightest but I could quote the Minister&rsquo;s own predictions for payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had no comprehensive database of property, which meant we could not send a bill to people.  An Post did not win the tender to deliver the leaflet, another company won it, although I have concerns about the manner in which it did that, which I will deal with in another way.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The extension of the deadline to September was proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and I rejected that.  I operate on the basis that people will come up to a deadline and then pay.  That is what happened, with 25% paying within a week of the deadline.  If the deadline is extended, people will wait for that deadline to pay.  We will process those who decided to pay at the 11th hour through An Post and that process will be completed in the next week or two.  People will then get reminders in the same way as any payment that is needed for any utility.  The data sharing protocols are in place to allow local authorities to send out letters over the summer.  Ultimately people must decide if they want to comply with the law or not and if they do not comply with the law, they face litigation.</P>
        <P>I accept there were difficulties with the categorisation of unfinished estates.  Only categories 3 and 4 were eligible for the exemption, estates that were largely in receivership or liquidation, or that were very badly unfinished.  The survey that was carried out did not capture all of them so we have asked local authorities to look at these matters in the light of genuine errors that were made and that city managers and county managers look at those sympathetically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will estates that have not yet been taken in charge form part of the survey?  There are many estates that have not been taken in charge that have legacy issues the local authorities are trying to address by dealing with developers.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not address the question of those who are genuinely unable to pay, such as the unemployed and old age pensioners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone knew what the deadline was and if people wanted to pay before the deadline, they would not have any penalties to pay.  I will not extend any exemptions for people who have not paid to date.  They will continue to pay in line with the legislation that was passed by the Oireachtas in December and in line with what I have said on all occasions, that there would be no more exemptions for people.  People knew exactly where they stood on this charge and there will be no change in that.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will be reinstating the independent planning investigations commenced in June 2010; if he will make known the specifics of the complaint received by him in relation to alleged planning irregularities in Carlow County Council which formed the basis for that council&rsquo;s inclusion in the aforementioned investigative process by the former Minister, Mr. Gormley; if he will advise when his Department&rsquo;s internal planning authority review report will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The planning review is intended to assess the application of planning legislation, policy and guidance within the development plan and development management systems at local level and to inform further policy development in these areas.  Seven planning authorities, including Carlow County Council, representing a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas as well as both large and small authorities, had been selected to assist in the review of policies and practices by reference to a number of cases raised with my Department.  In the case of Carlow County Council, the issues raised relate to weaknesses in the procedures followed by, and governance structures in place in, the planning department of the council.</P>
        <P>The question of reinstating the review does not arise as it was never terminated. Rather, I am proceeding now on the basis of my predecessor&rsquo;s decision that instead of incurring significant costs to the Exchequer by securing outsourced expertise, the Department would carry out an examination of the cases involved to inform the planning review.  I will be making a public statement in the coming weeks, setting out fully the nature of the complaints involved, the findings of the review and the conclusions and recommended next steps, as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>This question arises in the context of the report of the Mahon tribunal.  We know what happened in Dublin and that serious complaints were made to the Department and the Ombudsman about what had occurred in Cork.  I have a copy of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, delivered on 25 February, which refers to difficulties of a systemic nature.  Essentially, what is happening is similar to what occurred when the Ferns report &mdash; the first such report of its kind on child abuse within the church &mdash; was published.  In the context of child abuse, it did not come as a surprise that there was the same problem in other locations because the same structures and systems were in place.  The position is exactly the same in the planning system which lies at the core of the economic difficulties by which we have been beset.  People&rsquo;s sense of outrage regarding the Mahon tribunal cannot be temporary in nature.  The investigation carried out must be credible and allow people to feel a sense of confidence in the planning system into the future.  There can be no recurrence of past failures.  Is the Minister of State confident that an internal inquiry will be seen as credible from the point of view of restoring people&rsquo;s confidence?  Is she not of the view that there is a need for an independent assessment rather than an in-house one?  I fully appreciate that money is tight, etc.  However, an investigation must be credible, above reproach and independent.  Will an internal review deliver in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with a number of the comments made by the Deputy.  First, there is a need to restore confidence in the planning system.  In that context, we must respond to the abuses and corruption identified in the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report.  The Minister, other Ministers and I intend to respond to all of the recommendations contained in that report in a substantial and complete way.</P>
        <P>The investigations which are the subject of this question were instigated by the former Minister, Mr. John Gormley, and represent a selection of the overall number of complaints received by the Department in respect of virtually every local authority in the country.  The Department receives approximately 8,000 complaints from the public per annum about a variety of issues.  I am sure the position is the same in other Departments.  The seven cases in question were selected by the former Minister and we are carrying out investigations into them.  If the report on these matters suggests further and external investigations are required, I will order them.  We will publish a full report.  The investigators from the Department have carried out on-site visits in the seven local authorities in question and will supply us with a complete analysis.  I intend to publish the reports and recommendations I receive in full.  I am committed to ensuring confidence in the planning system is restored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the local authorities selected to be investigated were contacted and that they issued responses.  I actually have a copy of the response submitted by the authority in Cork.  I am sure each of the authorities involved has submitted a response at this point.  Does the Minister of State propose to publish them?  The State spent a small fortune on the Mahon tribunal and we were obliged to wait years for its report.  Members of the public who are picking up the tab in respect of this matter &mdash; not just with regard to the report but also in the context of the property bubble and the lack of strategic planning relating thereto &mdash; continually state no action is taken.  There is a need to resolve matters in a comprehensive and timely way with regard to individuals who still hold certain positions and in respect of whom questions have arisen in order that we might reassure the public and return to a position where we have a planning system over which we can stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the Mahon tribunal identified instances of serious corruption.  We must ensure we learn from what occurred in the past and implement the recommendations contained in that report.  The seven investigations relating to the local authorities do not relate to instances of corruption but rather to suggestions the administrative systems were not as good as they should have been.  For example, an issue arose with regard to the height of buildings in Dublin and there were a number of differences of opinion between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Dublin City Council in this regard.  Issues also arose in respect of pre-planning meetings in Cork.  There were other issues regarding the way planning departments were run.  These are all serious issues, but they are not of the same scale as those identified in the report of the Mahon tribunal.  In fairness to the local authorities concerned, we must acknowledge this fact.  If there is anything which suggests there is a need for further investigation to be carried out by an independent outside entity into the matters which are the subject of this question, I am committed to establishing such an investigation.  The report of the Mahon tribunal contains very significant recommendations which I intend to implement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 20 and 44 together.</P>
        <P>The online and written facilities for the registration of domestic wastewater treatment systems are being developed by the Local Government Management Agency on behalf of local authorities.  My Department is also examining a number of payment options to facilitate householders to the fullest extent possible in the registration process.  I understand the programming work for the online system will be completed shortly.  I have decided that when the registration commences, a reduced fee of &euro;5 will be payable for the initial three months and that a fee of &euro;50 will apply thereafter.  Ample time will be provided for householders to comply with the requirement to register their on-site wastewater treatment systems.  My Department will ensure a public information campaign, including details of how and when to register, will be carried out in advance of registration commencing.</P>
        <P>I published the draft performance standards for septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems for public consultation on 1 March.  The draft standards set out the responsibilities of owners of septic tanks and other systems, including requirements for the removal of sludge and ensuring systems are in working order and functioning properly.  The public consultation process regarding the draft performance standards concluded on 30 March.  In total, 165 submissions were received and these are being assessed in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  When this assessment has been completed, I will finalise the regulations which will give legal effect to the standards.  While it is not possible to specify the dates for the commencement of the registration process or finalisation of the performance standards at preent, these matters are being given priority and I expect to be in a position to make the necessary regulations as soon as possible.  At that stage, the relevant statutory instruments will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in line with a previous commitment I gave and in accordance with section 18 of the Water Services Act 2007.</P>
        <P>I have previously given a commitment that I will keep under consideration all options to provide financial support for householders whose systems are deemed, following inspection, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  Any decision in this regard will obviously have to take account of the nature of the inspections, the extent of the difficulties and problems which might arise from such inspections and relevant budgetary matters.  A national risk-based inspection plan is being prepared by the EPA and local authorities will be responsible for carrying out inspections in their functional areas.  I expect that inspections will start in 2013.  Inspections may give rise to householders being advised to improve the maintenance of their systems or, in more serious situations, upgrading or remediation of their treatment systems may be required.</P>

	<P>My party, Sinn F&eacute;in and some Independent Members tabled amendments on Committee Stage of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill which were debated at length, in which we sought to reduce the &euro;50 charge relating to septic tanks.

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that he could not accept our amendments because they would give rise to a charge on the Exchequer.  It was disrespectful to the Oireachtas that he could not agree to our amendments to reduce the registration fee and that he then made an announcement in this regard on the &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news programme.  This matter has been dealt with in a very disjointed fashion.  There was no reason people could not have registered their septic tanks when registering for the household charge.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy please ask a question?  There is a time limit for these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.  This shows the disjointed approach being taken to some of the projects being rolled out by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  The Minister has indicated that the national risk-based assessment plan is being prepared by the EPA and will be rolled out by the local authorities.  What is the position on the much discussed and promised grant aid scheme to assist householders who will be obliged to carry out improvement works?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the good decisions and progress made with the European Commission, which was very different to what was proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party when in government, I was in position not to have universal inspection of septic tanks or compliance with a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, code of practice.  Instead, I was able to get a risk-based approach and a solution based on the Cavan model.  Accordingly, we will not need as much money to administer the system as my predecessors would have made sure of taking from rural householders.  The registration was important.  I decided, however, it was not necessary to take &euro;17 million from rural householders.  All that is required for this particular scheme is &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million.</P>
        <P>The risk-based approach, along with the sensible and pragmatic measures we got agreement on with the European Commission, flies in the face of what was proposed in the past by my predecessors.  I am delighted with that result.  We will ensure a pragmatic approach is taken and we have outlined in the standards how this will happen.  The pragmatic approach and the agreement from the European Commission have come as a big surprise to some people.</P>
        <P>As I stated in the reply, if grant assistance is required for remediation arising from an inspection, then we will consider it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Stanley.  I remind Deputies that on ordinary questions it is one minute per supplementary.  We can go back again if required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not give a timeframe for when the regulations will be published.  I understood they would be published at the start of April and the registration process would begin then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The draft regulations were published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the registration process begin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Whenever we have the approval by the Oireachtas of the commitment I gave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister had a dig at me earlier that I do not support protecting the environment by having septic tanks working properly.  The Minister knows what I have always said on that and my commitment to the environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is doing the opposite, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be households in some of those high-risk areas which will need financial assistance.  I urge the Minister to bring that forward.  We want to protect water but if there are families caught out and they cannot afford remediation, there will be a need for financial assistance.</P>
        <P>On the standards, the devil will be in the detail.  When inspections commence, it is important the inspectors take a considered approach with householders.  Initially, these will be carried out by engineers from local authorities which is good news because they know their local areas&rsquo; circumstances.  I hope the inspections are rolled out in a practical way and will not be an imposition on people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have come a long way when we do not have people suggesting we are going to have to buy land to comply with these regulations, have planning permission or the 2009 EPA code of practice.  We have come a long way from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am also in favour of clean water and good quality groundwater unlike Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in and I regret to say that.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Members opposite are sensitive about this because they have been at public meetings advocating people should not register, pay or comply with good practice to ensure clean water supply.  What am I to do when I hear the views expressed here today in a rather hypocritical way?  The greatest nonsense of all time is that those who advocated a universal septic tank inspection regime and for 2009 EPA regulations in the past are now saying the risk-based approach we have succeeded in getting from the European Commission is inadequate.  I suppose the Members opposite are against the &euro;5 registration fee.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Stanley&rsquo;s question, if a household requires financial assistance, I will not rule it out.  However, we will not know that until the inspections are carried out in 2013.</P>

	<P>As I said on several occasions, I cannot talk about grant assistance with anybody until such time as I know the nature of the problem.  We will not know until the inspections are carried out.  I know Deputy Clare Daly would like me to give her a rather blanket answer stating there will be financial assistance.  Only when I know the extent of the problem will I consider grant aid.  Deputy Clare Daly may want to write a blank cheque on behalf of the taxpayer.  I will not be doing that.</P>

        <Quest>  the total number of staff in his Department in 2009, 2010, 2011 and currently; the redeployment of staff across sections that has occurred since March 2011; the amount spent on retraining programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There were 1,192 staff serving in the Department at the end of 2009, 1,177 at the end of 2010, 812 at the end of 2011 and 775 at the end of April 2012.  The significant change in the staff numbers between the end of 2010 and the end of 2011 arises from the transfer of the heritage function to the new Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in May 2011 and the transfer of community functions to my Department.  Having regard to these functional changes, to ensure delivery of the Department&rsquo;s overall objectives and business priorities, and taking account of the recommendations from the organisational review programme report, a restructuring of departmental divisions was carried out in mid-2011.</P>
        <P>Internal staff assignments and redeployment, together with streamlining of business areas, continue to be used to ensure optimum staffing in priority business areas.  This involved some 50 staff movements in 2011 and to date in 2012.  Staffing needs are also being addressed in the workforce planning process under way in my Department in the context of public service reform.  As part of this, a full skills needs and availability analysis is being carried out to inform future staffing deployment and training.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s priority business plan sets out the highest priority outputs, deliverables and ongoing activities for 2012.  This informs business planning at the business unit level and assists with resource and workforce planning.  In addition, my Department has also undertaken some internal redeployment and streamlining to take account of recent retirements and in preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency term in early 2013, in which environment, climate change and sustainable development are significant themes at EU and international level.</P>
        <P>My Department places considerable emphasis on relevant skills development.  It offers ongoing training programmes for staff, based on requirements identified through the performance management development system, PMDS, process and in the organisational review programme report.  The programmes vary and include training in areas such as ICT, language, law, economics, policy analysis, office skills and professional development.  Training is also provided under a refund of educational fees scheme which operates on an annual basis and where staff members can develop specific critical skills through a number of formal education programmes offered by third level institutions.  Expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s full training programme in 2009 was &euro;734,000, in 2010 was &euro;418,000 and in 2011 was &euro;336,000.  The training budget for 2012 is &euro;338,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 16, 21, 24, 31 and 43 together.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the Government&rsquo;s water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements that will ensure that we have a world class water and waste water infrastructure that meets all environmental and public health standards and is well positioned to attract foreign direct investment and support job creation and maintenance.  The Government considers charging based on usage the fairest way to charge for water and has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.  Irish Water will be responsible for the metering programme and, in common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water.</P>
        <P>The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to customers.  My Department is working with the CER on the development of the regulatory framework for the water sector and legislation will be prepared to provide the commission with the necessary powers to fulfil its new role.</P>
        <P>The Department estimates that there are approximately 1.35 million domestic properties connected to public water supplies in Ireland.  Following detailed analysis of available data, it is estimated that up to 300,000 of these households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty in doing so.  I expect an increasing number of households will be metered in the longer term as shared service connections are replaced and further options relating to metering apartment blocks are evaluated, including internal metering.  Households which are not initially metered will pay for water on an assessed basis.</P>
        <P>In keeping with international practice regarding water metering, the meters will be installed at the boundary of the property, most typically in the footpath at the front of a house.  Detailed cost estimates on the metering programme have been prepared by my Department.  However, it would not be appropriate to release these estimates in advance of the competitive procurement process.  The installation of the meters is labour intensive and will provide 2,000 jobs per annum during the course of the metering programme.  This is in addition to the significant employment that will be brought about through rolling out an enhanced Department water services investment programme.  The framework for water charges, including the charges for unmetered customers and the level of any standing charges, will be determined as part of the regulatory process.  No decision has been taken on the level of the free allowance.  Almost 300 submissions were received from organisations and individuals as part of the public consultation on the water services programme.  The submissions are being examined and will be taken into consideration in developing the implementation strategy for the transition of water services functions to Irish Water.</P>
        <P>With regard to rain water harvesting, the provision of a storage tank and the cost of its installation are important considerations.  The cost of installing a rain water harvesting system will be influenced by the existing roof drainage arrangements and the level of storage required.  The cost of retrofitting an average-sized suburban semi-detached household with a rain water harvesting system is estimated at between &euro;4,000 and &euro;6,000 and would also require significant modifications to internal plumbing systems to avoid cross-contamination with the public water supply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am shocked as although my question was quite specific, the Minister did not address a single part of it.  The question indicated that the Minister is privy to information submitted by local authority engineers which undermines the entire premise of the establishment of Irish Water in the first place.  In particular, they have pinpointed serious flaws in the PricewaterhouseCoopers study.  The comparison used was Scottish Water and the analysis submitted three major flaws in this comparison.  For example, the indicated pipe network, at 25,000 km, is half what it is in reality.  In addition, the indicated Scottish Water staff was in the region of 1,600 but the real figure is 3,500.  In other words, a picture was painted of Scottish Water being much more efficient than local authorities in Ireland in order to justify the establishment of Irish Water.  There were factual inaccuracies and serious omissions and although I asked the Minister to comment, he has not even mentioned the issue.  Will he answer the question I asked?  Perhaps he picked up the wrong piece of paper but I would like to get an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Deputy Daly has intimate knowledge of the matters.  The same company which carried out the independent assessment for Irish Water did it for Scottish Water, and it would understand a thing or two in the establishment of a public water utility for the provision of essential services for the people of Ireland.  I understand some of the data presented in the independent assessment by PricewaterhouseCoopers on Scottish Water has been disputed by the local authority professional officers section of SIPTU in a submission to the Department.  My Department is examining all the submissions it received but I should stress that the data concerned were contained in an appendix to the report for illustrative purposes only.  It was one part of an assessment of 11 different types of delivery models examined.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is again being selective in her quotes, as she was with a previous question.  The skills within local authorities will continue to be an essential part of the knowledge and expertise required to roll out this essential project.  I assure local authority staff that the service level agreements to be drawn up as part of this policy between Bord G&aacute;is and the Department, with local authorities, will continue to be maintained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of the free allowance is that the intention was for the charge to apply to waste.  The free allowance was to be sufficient for the individual in the average household and would vary depending on the number of people in the household.  It appears there will be sizeable income from these charges.  Will the Minister confirm that this is about charging for waste and not water?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister confirm no contractor has been appointed at this stage?  Many people are hoping to be employed to carry out this work but some have indicated they do not expect to be employed because the contracts have already been awarded.  Will he confirm if that is the case?</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned figures of between &euro;4,000 and &euro;6,000 in regard to water harvesting, suggesting it will not be possible to assist people in getting a source of water other than direct supply.  The Minister has also indicated the meters will be at a property boundary but many will be outside the boundary at a public location.  There may be a serious problem if a leak occurs between the meter and the tap, and who would pay for the repair in that case?  If a pensioner, for example, is facing a repair so extensive that he or she does not have the wherewithal to deal with it, how will the problem be solved?  Has that been considered in the pricing of water?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I am sure she would agree there are always rumours.  However, the notion that we have contracts given out is amazing when the only decision made is that a commercial semi-State organisation &mdash; Bord G&aacute;is &mdash; will be the company in charge of rolling out this Irish Water project.  It would be amazing for contracts to be given out already in Kildare and elsewhere.  I am sure the Deputy could allay the fears in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>So that is a &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the only principal decision that has been made, and I presume the Deputy accepts that.  The free allowance within the charge for water will form part of the discussions ongoing between Bord G&aacute;is, the regulator, the Department and the Government.  It is in the programme for Government.  We are not in a position to give details of an implementation plan that has not yet been drawn up.  We are in the process of formulating that plan.  As the Deputy said, rainwater harvesting is expensive.  However, it will save people money because this is essentially a water conservation programme.  If they want to install features in their businesses and households to conserve a finite and valuable resource, I encourage them to do so.  They will not have to pay as much if they have good water conservation programmes in place, in which we will assist them as part of the implementation plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, they will have to pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not provide grant assistance to introduce rainwater harvesting systems.  The problems identified by the Deputy such as whether the meter should be installed at the front or the back of the house will be dealt with in the same as they would be by other utility companies.  I am not in the business of micromanaging decisions to implement the policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I have serious concerns about the direction in which the Minister is moving&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in transferring powers from the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I know and I am coming to the point.  In this case, powers will transfer from local authorities which have provided the service during the years to Irish Water.  Responsibility for the licensing and roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles is also being transferred to the RSA from the local authorities.  The Minister has referred to local government reform and giving more powers to local authorities.  However, under this proposal, powers will be taken from councillors.  I attended a meeting last week with all the managers of Dublin City Council which was also attended by party colleagues of the Minister, including Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, and Deputy Catherine Byrne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a time limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that, but I have spoken only once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to adhere to Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised a question about the transfer of powers from the local authorities and the city manager, Dr. John Tierney, said, &ldquo;This was in the programme for Government and I was not consulted.&rdquo;  Is it the case that none of the local authority managers was consulted?  They are the experts.  Engineers have made their views known, as Deputy Clare Daly said, but it is crazy not to have consulted the managers overseeing the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>If that was the case, I would agree with the Deputy that that would be crazy, but two local authority managers were members of the project board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Who were they?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kerry and Cavan county managers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Dublin and Cork city councils?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to give the Deputy information.  The County and City Managers Association also made a submission.  Therefore, I would be surprised if any local authority manager was not aware of what was going on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has acknowledged that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report was disputed.  In the light of this, how can he justify making the decision without exploring these issues further?  Given that the company was involved in the Scottish Water project, does he not think there was a conflict of interest?  How much was the company paid for its work?</P>
        <P>What will the Minister do about the boundary issues relating to septic tanks and wastewater systems which have not been dealt with anywhere?  How will the infrastructure be divided between the local authorities and Irish Water?  Will the local authorities be left with the rubbish, while Irish Water is given all the best bits?  There has been no clarification of this anywhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The local authorities will continue to be centrally involved with Irish Water delivering wastewater as well as water services.  The fragmentation of local delivery has not worked because there have been many leaks and inadequate volumes and quality of water all over the country.  We have to do something different because what is happening is not working.  There will be an opportunity for additional finance to come into the system from the private sector to supplement the public sector to deal with the leaks and ensure we will have a substantially enhanced and accelerated programme of investment in water and wastewater services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>From where will the additional finance come in the private sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will go into Irish Water which will be a commercial semi-State company.  Private investment is made in the commercial semi-State sector and these companies are in the financial markets on a regular basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Give us an example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy is supportive of having a public water utility in State ownership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Municipal control seems to be international best practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the issues mentioned by the Deputy have been the subject of ongoing negotiations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to charge urban dwellers for the disposal of wastewater when the metering programme is up and running?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to be able to provide the detail on all these matters, but the only decision made by the Government at this stage is the principal one to establish Irish Water with the commercial semi-State body, Bord Gais, rolling it out.  The regulator will be consulted as part of the process.  All of these issues will be dealt with as part of the implementation plan.  I would love to give answers about the minute detail, but it will emerge in due course as part of the implementation plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to have it clarified that the Minister is not ruling out charging urban dwellers for the disposal of wastewater.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is part of the implementation plan.  I will not micromanage the implementation of these decisions.  These matters will come before the Government in due course and we will make a decision as part of the implementation plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister is saying is that we know they will be charged for water and he is effectively saying urban dwellers will be charged for the disposal of wastewater.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying nothing of the sort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not ruling it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is like asking how often do I beat my wife.  Is this the Lyndon B. Johnson way of doing things &mdash; make him deny it?  If that is the Fianna F&aacute;il way of doing things, that is fine.  I am interested in doing the business in solving the water issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister consider amending the building regulations to ensure that when a cistern is replaced, a dual flush cistern will be installed and that such cisterns will be installed in all new dwellings?  This would be cost neutral.  These cisterns save 20 litres of water per person a day.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Minister previously about the position of those who have meters installed.  There is a new water meter outside my house.  Will it be ripped out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not know a whole lot, which is a little frightening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister consider my dual flush cistern suggestion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that we will wait for the people who will carry out this project to come forward with an implementation plan.  We have made the principal decision about who will do the work and if the experts across the House want to implement the programme, they can go through the procurement process and might receive a contract.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister know anything?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Minister to consider a suggestion I made.  For the past 15 months he has been saying he is looking for suggestions.  I agreed with him on the need to adopt a risk-based approach to septic tanks, but I do not agree with him on many other issues.  When we make suggestions, will he try to take them on board?  The use of dual flush cisterns would be cost neutral for the Exchequer and the public.  I, therefore, plead with the Minister to consider amending the building regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy.  It is a good suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Brian Stanley should table another parliamentary question about that issue.  We are dealing with a series of questions for which the time has expired.  Other Deputies are waiting to have their questions dealt with.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will provide an update on the provision of funding for the RAPID scheme in Rathkeale, County Limerick; and if he will develop targeted regeneration scheme for the town.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[22087/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In December 2009 the Government approved disbursements from the dormant accounts fund for a once-off measure to the value of &euro;1.25 million for the five new provincial towns incorporated under the RAPID programme, including Rathkeale.  To date, it has not been possible to allocate funds to meet the cost of the proposed projects in any of the new RAPID programme towns because there is no money available.  The dormant accounts capital budget for my Department for 2012 is fully committed to existing projects and the priority in the light of that allocation must be to ensure sufficient funding is available to meet existing legal contractual commitments.  In the meantime, my Department will keep under review the scope to secure funds within its Vote to meet the cost of some of the projects, if I can, in 2012. </P>
        <P>Under the national housing regeneration programme, my Department supports a range of regeneration projects, including large mono-tenure areas, inner city flat complexes and social housing estates in regional towns.  To qualify for such support, a local authority must first demonstrate significant social and economic disadvantage and a poor living environment and that these challenges cannot be met by other interventions, for example, through remedial works.  To date, my Department has not received an application for such support for a regeneration project in Rathkeale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this issue a number of times.  Rathkeale is the second largest town in County Limerick and has deep-rooted, chronic systemic problems associated with property ownership which are exacerbated by the fact the vast majority of property is owned by members of the Traveller community who reside in the State intermittently and do not exercise responsibility in terms of property ownership.  Dereliction, abandonment and unauthorised developments are the order of the day.</P>
        <P>The local community council has been very proactive in trying to deal with these issues.  It has come to a stage where the non-Traveller community in Rathkeale feels completely under siege because any piece of property which comes for sale in Rathkeale is immediately snapped up by a member of the Traveller community at a price which is out of the reach of the majority of the non-Traveller community.  Rathkeale has been dropped off many maps.  For example, tourism promotion maps of the mid-west are dropping Rathkeale.  I could speak for the night in regard to the issues.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State, as I asked Deputy Penrose when it was his job, could they take the time to meet the Rathkeale community council and try to develop some kind of a plan to help them to address the issues.  For example, a property audit needs to be carried out in Rathkeale, at a minimum, and there are many other issues associated with the RAPID project.  Will the Minister give a commitment to meet this group at some time in the near future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise the genuine concerns of Deputy Collins in regard to this matter, which he and the other Deputies in the constituency, Deputies Neville and O&rsquo;Donovan, have raised on a number of occasions.  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, and I are very keen to assist in whatever way we can but we will not give false hope.  If savings accrue during the year in regard to other contractual obligations we have, perhaps we will able to do something for places like Rathkeale.  We are not going to announce an initiative with no money, as happened in the past, as that would give false hope to people.</P>
        <P>While I will take on board what Deputy Collins has said, I do not believe the opportunity that presents in the short term will satisfy the requirements in Rathkeale.  We will be glad to keep him informed if any savings accrue from contractual obligations that are ongoing in 2012.  Rathkeale will certainly be one of the priority areas we will consider favourably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe some of what the previous speaker said had an anti-Traveller tone.  I tend to resent some of the things that have been said about the Traveller community and minority communities.</P>
        <P>RAPID has been fantastic for certain disadvantaged areas like my area of Finglas and Ballymun, which has availed of the programme.  The Minister said money may become available.  Is there a possibility of reintroducing RAPID, which has addressed huge areas throughout the country?  If he does get extra cash, it is important he would look at these areas.  RAPID adds to the quality of life and cuts down the problems we face in most of these areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very conscious of a number of areas where we would like to have money to implement programmes that were brought to our attention through the RAPID programmes.  I am very committed to the RAPID and regeneration programmes, as is the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  We are, unfortunately, in a bailout programme and cash is not as plentiful as it was.  Therefore, we are quite straight with people.  If we find savings during the course of the year from projects that are under way, we will be glad to redirect some of those resources to areas of greatest need, including the areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> the degree to which the shared ownership mortgage scheme is continuing to develop with particular reference to the degree to which those who obtain such mortgages are penalised by way of increased value of rental part of the equity thereby resulting in a situation wherein people who were deemed eligible for such loans on the basis of their income have been penalised on the grounds of annual rental increase plus mortgage increase plus notice to the effect that purchase of the remaining equity must be effected within the term of the original loan; if his attention has been drawn to the concern and hardship now being caused in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22166/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Shared Ownership scheme the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.</P>
        <P>Local authority mortgage holders &mdash; including those who purchased under shared ownership &mdash; also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which generally run at around 0.5% lower than the best rates available in the market and currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review which will shortly commence.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</P>
        <P>The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year.  The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</P>
        <P>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 18 and 57 together.</P>
        <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a proposal to establish Irish Water, a State-owned water company that will take over the water investment and maintenance programmes of the 34 city and county councils who act as water services authorities.  The Programme of Financial Support for Ireland with the EU/IMF/ECB also requires the preparation of proposals for implementation of the recommendations of an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water service provision to a water utility and that water charges would be introduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of the independent assessment undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers, to establish a public water utility company to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area. The Government also decided that certain issues raised in the independent assessment in regard to whether Irish Water should be established as a new State Agency or whether the role of Irish Water should be assigned to an existing State Agency should be analysed further with a view to ensuring that existing resources and capabilities in the State sector were used to best effect. This approach is also in line with Government plans to support economic growth by eliminating waste and duplication in public spending through rationalising state agencies.</P>
        <P>The further analysis was undertaken by a team comprising my Department and NewERA, in consultation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.   The process involved an assessment of the capacity and capabilities of a number of State agencies from amongst those identified in the independent assessment as having the potential to incorporate a new water utility.   It was not a tendering process culminating in the award of a contract.  The process involved the making of detailed submissions and presentations by Bord na M&oacute;na and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann based on identified capabilities required for the establishment and operation of Irish Water.  The outcome of this analysis is that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group.  This was agreed by Government at its meeting on 17 April 2012. Irish Water will be a public utility, wholly owned by the State, with water services remaining in public ownership.</P>
        <P>The initial transition strategy for the establishment of Irish Water as a public utility, as recommended in the independent assessment, envisages a staged approach involving local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water for a period with Irish Water taking over their operations on a phased basis from January 2015, and the full transfer of operations being completed by end 2017, at the earliest.   A more detailed implementation strategy for Irish Water is now being developed to give further effect to the Government decision of 17 April.   NewERA are participating in the steering group to develop this strategy.</P>
        <P>A detailed breakdown for the cost of establishing and running Irish Water is not at present available. The Government has also decided that the Commission for Energy Regulation will be responsible for the independent regulation of Irish Water and that the Commission will be responsible for determining the cost of water services to the consumer. The finalisation of the implementation strategy will focus on implementation and transformation issues involved in the creation of the new public water utility and will recommend appropriate transitional arrangements. The strategy will also focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 49 together. </P>
        <P>I and my Department are being kept informed by Dublin City Council of developments with regard to the resolution of issues at Priory Hall. At my request, the Department has assisted the Council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents.  My Department has made a contribution towards the costs necessarily incurred by Dublin City Council, in the context of a judgment of the High Court, in providing temporary accommodation for households evacuated from Priory Hall.  Dublin City Council is the designated authority with powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under the Fire Safety Act, the Building Control Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which are at issue in relation to Priory Hall.  The Council is also the designated Housing Authority under the Housing Acts.</P>
        <P>My own responsibility as Minister is to ensure that appropriate statutory requirements, technical standards and administrative provisions are put in place under the various acts.  This responsibility has been fulfilled and is not in dispute.  While I sympathise with the residents who have been placed in a very difficult position, and wish to see their difficulties resolved as quickly as possible, I have no role in relation to enforcement activity or in relation to the direct provision of housing services. The appropriate statutory powers in this case rest with Dublin City Council and neither I nor the Department has a statutory function in relation to enforcement activity or in determining the provision of services in individual cases.   It is important that I as Minister act appropriately and within the powers given to me, particularly in a case such as this which is already the subject of legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>The recent adjournment of those legal proceedings for a period of three months to allow for a conciliation process chaired by Justice Finnegan provides an appropriate context for the parties concerned to work together towards identifying a way forward in relation to this complex problem. I would strongly encourage the financial institutions, the residents of Priory Hall and Dublin City Council to engage fully with this new process to give it every chance to succeed.  It is important that all concerned now afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he has been given.  Dublin City Council has made commendable efforts to provide for the needs of residents to date and continues to work proactively on their behalf towards achieving the much needed resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.</P>

	<P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  Priory Hall is included on the list of those estates within which residents qualify for a waiver in 2012.

	<P>In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department&rsquo;s overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing.  Under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a grant of up to &euro;15,000 per dwelling, depending on the energy improvement achieved, for necessary works such as attic and wall insulation, the replacement of windows and external doors and the fitting of energy-efficient condensing boilers. Additional funding, to a maximum of &euro;3,000, is available for other essential improvement works to the dwelling.  While the objective is to improve the general standard of a local authority house and increase the Building Energy Rating (BER) to as high a level as possible, with C1 being the target figure, it may not be practicable to bring every dwelling to this standard, especially in the case of older stock.  Exchequer grants are not payable in respect of the achievement of G or F ratings.</P>

A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests. A consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

I intend to publish the regulatory impact analysis concerning the regulation of household waste collection subsequent to Government&rsquo;s consideration of the issues.</P>
        <P>Household waste collection is a service of critical importance to every household in the country.

I expect to be in a position to finalise proposals for Government in relation to household waste collection in the coming weeks.

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</P>
        <P>The social housing capital budget has reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</P>
        <P>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</P>

        <P>Following the 31 March payment deadline, national and local radio advertisements were undertaken to remind persons of their obligations under the household charge legislation.  In particular, this campaign was aimed at reminding householders that late payment penalties applied after 31 March and that unpaid household charges and late payment penalties remain as a charge against the property concerned and will have to be discharged in the event of the transfer or sale of the property.  In addition, local authorities are also taking other local initiatives to remind persons of their obligations under the legislation. Further local and national communications and advertising will be undertaken by the LGMA and local authorities as considered appropriate.</P>

        <Quest> if he will commit to a target of providing 1,600 housing units for homeless persons this year and next year to help end long-term homelessness by the end of 2013; and his plans to achieve this target. </Quest>

	<P>While the target set in the <i>National Homeless Strategy 2008-2013</i>, A Way Home, of ending long term homelessness was not met, progress in achieving this challenging ambition is a principal objective of national housing policy.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities. In this context a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities is being put in place and will result in increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements. It strives to improve overall efficiency and value for money and will provide a more planned approach to the delivery locally and regionally of homeless services.  The system has been put in place in the Dublin region since 1 January 2012 and it is to be extended nationally to the other regions by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply for the homeless, and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches. The initial emphasis in the Dublin region, where there is a greater concentration of those accessing homelessness services, will be on moving away from the current over reliance on emergency accommodation provision to a more permanent accommodation solution to be achieved through a number of measures including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />directly linking the provision of funding with specific targets and outcomes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />making better use of the existing available accommodation units in the local authorities and in the voluntary sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />additional social housing provision through acquisitions and remedial works/upgrading of vacant local authority housing stock and a leasing programme;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />ongoing engagement with NAMA to secure properties;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />targeted use of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />an enhanced role for the private rental sector; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />better co-ordination with the voluntary and cooperative housing sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The <i>Programme for Government</i> committed to reviewing the national homeless strategy and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness. The draft of the review is being considered by my Department and it is intended shortly to present it to the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness and the Homeless Consultative Committee for consultation. The review will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together. </P>
        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.   I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 30 April, 2012, a total of 931,446 declarations have been received for the household charge.  15,336 declarations have been received where a waiver from payment of the household charge has been claimed.  I will be keeping the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and I and local authorities will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 47 and 53 together.</P>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the 2012 estimates process, difficult decisions had to be taken in relation to prioritising funding for core services in all programme areas.  The funding estimate to support the mainstreamed drugs projects under my Department&rsquo;s Housing programme for 2012 was &euro;100,000, compared with &euro;400,000 in 2011.  In view of this, my Department informed the relevant local authority that it would not be possible to continue funding the projects concerned throughout 2012.  Pro rata funding will be provided to fund the projects concerned until end June 2012 in order to allow the projects and other bodies to explore alternative funding mechanisms and identify resources to deliver on the overall objectives of the projects beyond end June 2012.</P>
        <P>More broadly, and in the context of a public funding provision of &euro;260 million for drugs programmes across all Departments and agencies in 2011, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, is currently undertaking a review of the structures that underpin the National Drugs Strategy at local, regional and national level, including how the current funding structures can be improved or streamlined, particularly in relation to local and regional drugs task forces.  The outcomes of this review are expected shortly and will clarify, inter alia, the position on the most appropriate funding mechanisms for community based drugs projects.</P>
        <P>In relation to my Department&rsquo;s representation on the Drugs Advisory Group, this matter is being kept under review in the context of overall Departmental resources and priorities.  In the meantime, my Department continues to facilitate full engagement with the Department of Health in relation to any relevant issues arising under the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector.  My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  The drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill was approved by Government in July 2011 and the Bill is currently in preparation by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in collaboration with my Department.</P>
        <P>Among the main issues that will be addressed by the amending legislation are&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel its current remit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Programme for Government 2011  also commits to the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and it is important that action in this regard is taken in the context of a strong evidence base.  I have therefore asked the PRTB to commission cost benefit analysis-based research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations.  I understand that the PRTB has recently awarded the tender for this research and I expect that the Board will revert to me with detailed research and recommendations in the autumn.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Acts 2000-11 provide that the Board comprises a Chairperson and up to 9 ordinary members.  The processes for the appointment of the Chair and ordinary Board Members are clearly and transparently set out under sections 105-107 of the Act and associated regulations.</P>
        <P>In relation to the position of Chairperson, the appointment is made by Government from candidates selected by an independent statutory selection committee.  The composition of this committee is set out under section 105 of the Act and, where a vacancy arises, the committee is required to select a maximum of three suitable candidates from among those who compete in a publicly advertised open competition. The selection committee established in accordance with the Act includes:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the President of the High Court</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the Chairperson of An Taisce</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Dr. Mary Kelly was appointed in May 2011 on foot of this process.</P>
        <P>The appointment process for ordinary Board Members, set out under section 106 of the Act, provides that appointments are made by the Minister from nominees put forward by four representative panels of nominating bodies prescribed for this purpose.  The organisations which make up these nominating panels are set out in Article 64 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 as amended.  These bodies represent a wide range of interests so that potential appointees are drawn from a balanced group of people, with diverse backgrounds, who can reach a balanced view on the issues with which the Board is concerned.  Each body in each panel was invited to nominate two candidates for consideration for appointment to the Board.</P>
        <P>Arising from four recent appointments made by Minister Hogan, the Board will shortly comprise eight members including the Chair.  In making these appointments cognisance was taken of the balance of skill sets and expertise required by Board members for the effective discharge of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s complex and wide ranging functions, as well as the balance of skill sets and qualifications held by existing Board members.  None of the recent appointments was made under section 106(1)(<i>e</i>).  I am satisfied that the current nomination and appointment process is fair and transparent.</P>

	<P>The Government recently announced its decision in principle to support proposals to transfer responsibility for households in receipt of rent supplement, but with an established long-term social housing need, from the Department of Social Protection to the housing authorities.  Housing authorities will provide this service using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  This joint proposal, between the two Departments, reflects a commitment in the Programme for Government  to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme due to concerns over the evolution of rent supplement from a short-term income support into a long-term housing support.  It was also one of the key reforms announced in my Department&rsquo;s Housing Policy Statement in June 2011.</P>
        <P>The detail of the proposed transfer and any standards or criteria to be introduced are in the process of being developed and agreed through an established Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and a number of specific working groups.  It is hoped, however, that the proposals will deliver a number of benefits for householders, the State and housing authorities, including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />enabling job take-up by tenants who have been caught by poverty traps until now;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />allowing local authorities more flexibility in assisting those in need of social housing support;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />providing greater security of tenure for tenants, greater stability in the private rented market and contributing towards the creation of a higher quality, private rented sector through improved standards;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />providing a more integrated and streamlined service for households seeking support from the State to meet housing costs;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />delivering value for money for the taxpayer for the resources invested.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The proposed reform of the rent supplement scheme constitutes a major development in the provision of housing services and will require careful planning and consultation with interested parties.  I hope to be in a position to announce further details of the new arrangements later in the year.</P>

	<P>The application from Providence Resources for a foreshore licence in respect of site investigations and the drilling of an exploratory well off Dalkey is currently being assessed by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee.  I will consider the recommendation of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee and my Department in due course in making a determination on the licence application.  As indicated in reply to previous Questions on this matter, I do not consider that a public inquiry is warranted.  Without prejudging my eventual determination of the current application, it is important to recognise that should the project progress to commercial exploitation it would be the subject of further formal applications for consents from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in the first instance, and then An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning Acts, and a full lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts, all of which will  require an Environmental Impact Assessment, including full public consultation and, where appropriate, oral hearing.</P>

	<P>One of the main features of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is that local authorities, in sourcing accommodation for households, enter into contractual arrangements with private sector landlords to secure medium to long-term availability of rented accommodation.  The level of rents payable under RAS is determined by negotiations between the landlord and the local authority, taking account of rent supplement levels and local market conditions.  In negotiating with landlords to bring properties into RAS, local authorities obtain reductions on existing rents where possible.  Guidance which has issued by my Department advises that a discount of at least eight per cent below market rent is recommended.</P>
        <P>As part of their negotiation process, local authorities may agree, at their discretion, periodic rent reviews with landlords in line with the prevailing market conditions at the time.  My Department has issued guidance to authorities advising them to ensure that rent reviews are undertaken where provided for and also advising authorities of the need to obtain value for money and have regard to local market conditions when entering into new agreements.  The achievement of value for money is the primary focus of authorities when negotiating costs and other associated terms and conditions provided for in agreements under the Scheme.  Information in relation to the value of savings made resulting from negotiated contracts entered into by individual local authorities is not available in my Department.  A Value for Money and Policy Review has been carried out on the RAS which provides general information on discounts achieved based on a sample of local authorities.  This study will be available shortly.</P>

	<P>The design and installation of wastewater treatment systems for single houses is addressed in the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Code of Practice in respect of Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses (2009).  On foot of a comprehensive review and public consultation, Part H (Drainage and Wastewater Disposal) of the Building Regulations and its accompanying Technical Guidance Document H (TGD H 2010) were amended in the latter half of 2010 to reflect the relevant parts of the EPA&rsquo;s Code of Practice.</P>
        <P>The Technical Guidance Document H (TGD H 2010) further stipulates that the design and commissioning of wastewater treatment systems should be carried out and/or supervised by a suitably qualified person and that the owner of the building should be provided with sufficient, clear and comprehensive information on any continuing maintenance required to facilitate the effective operation of the system in order to protect human health and the environment.  The Building Regulations normally apply to new dwellings and existing dwellings where a material change is being carried out.  Where a service is being replaced, the requirements of the Building Regulations specific to the replacement apply.  Repair or renewals works do not normally come within the scope of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>In relation to the use of septic tanks in particular, TGD H 2010 states that &ldquo;Septic Tanks must conform to I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4 including their national annexes and comply with the EPA Code of Practice &mdash; Section 7.&rdquo;  The national annexes were recently completed and published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, in consultation with my Department and others.  They set out clearly the performance required by septic tanks when used in Ireland, and tested in accordance with I.S.  EN 12566 Parts 1 or 4.  Given that the current regulations and related guidance already set out clearly the requirements in respect of septic tanks, I have no plans to further amend Part H of the Building Regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is aware that a number of planning authorities have incorporated Renewable Energy Strategies into their Development Plans, and a further number are in the process of so doing.  The Sustainable Energy Association of Ireland (SEAI), as part of its brief to promote and assist the development of sustainable energy, hosted a number of regional wind energy workshops in 2010, targeted at local authority planners and other officials and stakeholders involved in the delivery of wind energy.  At the workshops a number of stakeholders stated that they would welcome assistance in the preparation of more comprehensive Renewable Energy Strategies for their areas.  Following this SEAI decided to prepare a methodology or template to act as a guide to assist local authorities in the preparation of renewable energy strategies.  This will act as a guideline for local authorities when developing a Renewable Energy Strategy, including the matters to be taken into consideration and the information, resources and bodies that may be of assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">SEAI appointed consultants to assist in the preparation of the methodology, which is under way and it also set up a Project Steering Committee to input into its development.  The committee includes representation from my Department, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Irish Planning Institute, the City and County Managers Association, the Regional Authorities, EirGrid, ESB Networks, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>My Department has also encouraged the provision of certain renewable technologies through the exempted development Regulations.  The Planning and Development Regulations 2007, which came into effect from 28 February 2007, provide exemptions from planning permission requirements in respect of certain classes of micro-renewable technologies for use in the home i.e. solar panels and other micro-renewable technologies such as wind turbines, heat pumps and biomass, subject to certain conditions in each case.  The Planning and Development Regulations 2008, which came into effect from 2 July 2008, provide exemptions from planning permission requirements in respect of certain classes of renewable technologies for use in industrial buildings, business premises and agricultural holdings, including combined heat and power, wind turbines, solar panels, heat pumps and biomass, subject to certain conditions in each case.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Building Regulations, Part L &mdash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy for Buildings other than Dwellings is scheduled for review in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013.  The review process will involve an industry stakeholder group review and a public consultation.  The review process will also take account of the Recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requirements to achieve nearly zero energy buildings where &ldquo;the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby;&rdquo; for new public buildings by 2018 and for all new buildings by 2020.</P>
        <P>Part L of the Regulations &mdash; Dwellings &mdash; requires renewable energy sources to provide a reasonable proportion of the energy consumption to meet the energy performance for new dwellings since 1 July 2008 (subject to a transition period).  This will also be a factor to be taken into consideration in the review of Part L Buildings other than Dwellings.  While I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the inclusion of some renewable energy source in industrial and large commercial planning permissions by means of planning conditions, my Department will continue to pursue all appropriate measures to contribute to the achievement of national renewable energy targets.</P>

	<P>The Government remains concerned about the case of Mrs. Asia Bibi.  In November 2010 a Punjab court found Mrs. Bibi guilty of blasphemy, sentencing her to death by hanging.  This is the first time that a woman has been sentenced to death in Pakistan under its blasphemy law.  When the case came to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ambassador accredited to Pakistan at the time called upon the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad to convey our concern at the conviction and sentence.  He also expressed our disquiet at the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy law.  Since that time, a number of representations have been made to the Embassy of Pakistan by senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
        <P>Mrs. Bibi&rsquo;s case and Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws were discussed at length during bilateral political consultations in Dublin in 2011 which were held with the Pakistani Additional Foreign Secretary for Europe.  In the course of these consultations our concerns about the conviction, sentence and the nature of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws were again strongly expressed.  At the European level, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton, has also expressed her concerns at the Bibi judgement and others like it, and called on Pakistan to respect human rights as guaranteed under international conventions to which it is a party.</P>
        <P>The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, including religious discrimination.  The EU has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.  The EU has made clear to the Government of Pakistan that under its constitutional and international requirements it has a responsibility to protect its citizens regardless of their faith.</P>
        <P>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.  We are well aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise the case of Asia Bibi and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the European Union and the United Nations.</P>

	<P>The administrative costs associated with running the Embassy in Washington DC from 2008 to 2011 to date are provided below.  This budget is considered to be the locally-devolved administrative (day-to-day) budget including local staff salaries but not salaries of diplomatic staff, which are a charge on the Headquarters budget.  In line with overall Departmental cost-containment policies, the Mission constantly monitors its budget and the costs for 2011 are less than those incurred in the preceding years.  Our Mission in Washington is actively engaged in representing and advancing Irish government policies in the United States and maintaining and further developing our excellent bilateral relationship with the United States, one of our most important relationships both politically and economically. US investment in Ireland continues to be crucial to our economy and the US friendship and support has been hugely important in the success of the peace process over many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Embassy in Washington is putting an ever increasing focus on developing Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral economic relations, and trade and investment links and engaging with the US.  The Embassy maintains strong relations with the US Administration and Congress on issues likely to affect Ireland&rsquo;s exports, inward investment and other key interests.  The Embassy also promotes business and economic ties, for example this year through its promotion of the Euroscience Open Forum (ESOF) 2012 Dublin City of Science in the US and through the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding between US Department Energy and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for co-operation in marine and hydrokinetic energy technologies.</P>
        <P>The Embassy also provides frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens.  In conjunction with Ireland&rsquo;s friends on Capitol Hill and throughout the Irish-American community, it also seeks to identify and promote solutions on immigration issues as they affect Irish people and undocumented Irish migrants in particular.  It engages with the Irish and Irish American communities and harnesses the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery. The Embassy also contributes to promoting Irish arts and culture in the US.</P>

	<P>Taking account of its overriding commercial mandate as set out in Section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA has demonstrated its commitment and contribution to the achievement of wider social and economic policy objectives in line with Section 2 of the Act. This includes NAMA&rsquo;s policy to give first option to public bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes. NAMA also facilitates dialogue between its debtors/receivers and third parties which has enabled the latter to acquire suitable properties for civic, community and sporting purposes.</P>
        <P>In December 2011, NAMA identified over 2,000 properties as being available for social housing, representing, potentially, one of the largest housing allocations made in the history of the State.  The primary onus is now on local authorities and voluntary and co-operative housing bodies to match their needs against the units which have been identified as available by NAMA. The Deputy may be aware that NAMA also concluded the sale of 58 housing units in Sandyford, Co. Dublin to the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association in 2011, marking the first time that stock controlled by NAMA was used for the delivery of permanent new social housing.  Other such sales are in process.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by NAMA that there is significant engagement between the Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to identify sites for Primary Health Care Centres and other step-down and community health care facilities.  The Deputy may also be aware that NAMA has identified 11 sites as being potentially suitable for the location of the Government&rsquo;s planned National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the Minister for Health and Children is on the public record as saying that he will look at these sites in this context and in the context of the Department&rsquo;s other pressing requirements.</P>
        <P>NAMA further informs me that there has been a constructive engagement between the Agency and the Department of Education and Skills, which has already resulted in the identification and sale of lands for schools and to accommodate planned development by certain universities. This engagement is ongoing as is NAMA&rsquo;s interaction with other public bodies, including local authorities.  The Agency also works to facilitate engagement between interested parties, including community and sporting organisations, and its debtors/receivers/sales agents and this has led to a number of positive outcomes for both parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that approximately 20,000 taxpayers were originally notified by letter in January 2012 that they might have a potential refund of tax due for 2011, and that Revenue would automatically carry out a review. This process could not begin until the pay and tax deducted details in respect of 2011 were submitted by employers on the annual P35 form and processed by Revenue.  Of these, the tax affairs of some 12,000 taxpayers have already been reviewed.  To date, I am further advised that some &euro;2 million has already been refunded to approximately 7,000 taxpayers and in the rest of these cases no refund of tax was actually due.  A further programme of reviews will be run over the coming weeks for the remaining 8,000 taxpayers, once all of the information required by the Commissioners to carry out these reviews is available.  In this regard, the 2011 form P35s are still awaited in some cases or are currently being processed in other cases.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have taken a number of steps to inform potential refund recipients.  Firstly, as indicated earlier, any taxpayer who was potentially over-taxed on their DSP pension received a letter in late December 2011 explaining that Revenue would be reviewing their tax affairs for 2011 with a view to making any relevant refund for that year.  Secondly, Revenue has, through its contacts with representative bodies acting for the elderly, continued to reinforce the message that anyone who feels that they may be due a refund should contact the Commissioners directly.  Thirdly, Revenue has published extensive frequently asked questions on its website on the taxation of DSP pensions and addresses the issue of potential refunds within that.  Taking all of these measures into account, as well as the direct contacts that Revenue staff has with DSP pension recipients through handling telephone contacts and public office visits and the extent of the publicity on the matter of pensioners and tax, I am satisfied that anyone who may be due a refund is aware of the steps they need to take to make a claim.</P>

	<P>In July 2011 a net amount of &euro;16.5 billion was injected into Irish financial institutions. At the time of the end-September Maastricht return, it was indicated publicly that a full examination of the deficit-impacting amount of this transfer would be made before the next notification. The outcome of this exercise is that of the &euro;16.5 billion injected in June 2011, &euro;5.8 billion is classified as a deficit-increasing capital transfer. This adds 3.7 per cent of GDP to the deficit for 2011 only.    However, the full net recapitalisation of &euro;16.5 billion in July 2011 was fully reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s forecast General Government Debt for end-2011 reported to Eurostat in September 2011. It is also included in the end-March 2012 Maastricht return in respect of the end-2011 debt position. The statistical reclassification from financial transaction to capital transfer affects the general government deficit only. Therefore there is no impact on our debt to GDP ratio as a result of this statistical reclassification.</P>

I understand that as a consequence of the defects identified during the legal due diligence, the valuation of the assets was reduced and a lesser amount was paid by NAMA.

However, as Irish Life is now in public ownership, Eurostat attached a reservation to our Maastricht Returns in which it raised concerns about the private sector ownership of the NAMA SPV and consequently the treatment of NAMA for the purposes of calculating General Government Debt.  I am advised that the sale of the Irish Life shareholding in the NAMA SPV to private investors has been agreed and it is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in the coming weeks.

	<P>The EFSF has been created as a temporary institution.  The EFSF Framework agreement as amended provides that &ldquo;Euro-area Member States which are potential Borrowers may only request and enter into Loan Facility Agreements up to 30 June 2013 (provided that Loans may be disbursed after this date under Loan Facility Agreements entered into prior to this date).&rdquo;  It also provides that EFSF guarantors shall only be required to issue a guarantee to facilitate the financing under Loan Facility Agreements entered into on or prior to 30 June 2013. </P>
        <P>In accordance with its Articles of Association, the EFSF will be liquidated on the earliest date after 30 June 2013 on which there are no longer loans outstanding to a euro-area Member State and all Funding Instruments issued by EFSF and any reimbursement amounts due to Guarantors have been repaid in full.  This means that after June 2013, EFSF would not enter into any new programmes but will continue the management and repayment of any outstanding debt and will close down once all outstanding debt has been repaid.</P>
        <P>The Eurogroup&rsquo;s statement of 30 March 2012, provides that the ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012. The EFSF will, as a rule, only remain active in financing programmes that have started before that date. For a transitional period until mid-2013, it may engage in new programmes in order to ensure a full fresh lending capacity of EUR 500 billion for the ESM.</P>
        <P>These arrangements form part of a number of initiatives. All these initiatives were made to improve the governance of the euro area through enhancements of the Stability and Growth Pact, the new macro-economic imbalances procedure, the Euro Plus Pact and the Fiscal Compact enshrined in the new Treaty on Stability, Cooperation and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, robust firewalls have been established. This comprehensive strategy has paid off and led to a significant improvement of market conditions.</P>

	<P>In relation to the particular transaction to which the Deputy refers, NAMA has advised me that the sales agent was acting on behalf of the debtor and that a competitive sales process was undertaken. The debtor was not in liquidation. I understand from NAMA that the sale was managed and implemented on behalf of the debtor by a firm of professional sales agents. Following wide engagement with viable interested parties, a special purchaser emerged in respect of the entire holding of 450 acres at a price considerably in excess of that guided by the retained professionals. It was the considered advice of the sales agent that the offer from this purchaser would be accepted.</P>
        <P>I further understand that NAMA, on receipt of this information, commissioned a second independent report by another professional firm, which agreed with the original guide price.  On the basis of this independent valuation advice, which established that the price offered was 40% in excess of the 2 independent valuations and taking account of the fact that the offer was for the entire holding rather than for individual land plots within it, NAMA granted its approval to the debtor to proceed with the sale on the advised terms on the basis that this maximised the recovery for the taxpayer.  I understand from NAMA that this site, like all sites, would have been advertised except that the special purchaser emerged offering 40% over the independent valuations of the site&rsquo;s worth.</P>

	<P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the unfortunate and unacceptable leak which took place on February 29th this year.  The document which leaked in February was the EU Commission Services Staff report on their assessment of the 5th review of Ireland&rsquo;s EU-IMF Programme of support. As a Commission document, the content of the staff report is the responsibility of the Commission staff, as is the publication of the report.  This document was circulated to senior EU Finance Ministry officials in advance of the relevant EU Officials discussion that were to take place that week which is normal practice for all programme countries. The report which was published as scheduled the next day, March 1st, was substantially the same as that circulated for officials.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that Commission staff had appended to it the updated programme documents that were prepared following the 5th review &mdash; specifically &mdash; the Letter of Intent to the EU authorities, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). These updated programme documents, along with the Letter of Intent to the IMF, had already been made publicly available shortly after being issued by the Minister for Finance, by being laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and placed on the Department of Finance website, on 14th February last.</P>
        <P>On becoming aware of the leak, and the internal Commission process that they have in place, my officials raised our serious concerns with the Commission.  I also contacted Commissioner Olli Rehn to express my disappointment regarding the leak and to enquire about steps taken to ensure confidentiality of documents in the future. The issue has also been raised at senior official level with the German authorities. We must nevertheless recognise that we remain in a Programme, and continue to rely on the support of the External Partners.  In expressing our concern, we need also to continue working with our partners.</P>

I am advised by NAMA that the estimated value of downward adjustments applied to the consideration paid to banks in respect of the acquisition of loans as a result of security defects identified in legal due diligence is &euro;477 million.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Relationship Frameworks, the Boards of the Banks are responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of the respective institutions including decisions regarding civil proceedings taken and I have no role in this matter. The question of whether an undertaking provided by a solicitor to a bank is &lsquo;false&rsquo; is a matter of determination by a court of law (with involvement of Garda&iacute; and supervisory authorities if fraud is asserted) and AIB, Bank of Ireland and IBRC cannot therefore estimate the extent to which such findings will be arrived at by a court of law. The banks have confirmed that, in appropriate cases, solicitors who have not fulfilled their undertakings to them have been and will be pursued.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for the banks to name defendants in such cases.</P>

	<P>Under the Barcelona Conclusions individual member states are invited to adopt the approaches set out in the Conclusions insofar as is appropriate to their particular national priorities, circumstances and resources.  My Department fully accepts the desirability of this approach as an EU policy direction. This does not mean however that it is necessarily practicable in every Member state.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, where there are two national languages, Irish and English, given recognition under the Constitution, both of these languages are taught at primary level.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of developing a language curriculum for infant classes which will inform future developments.  The NCCA does not intend to compartmentalise children&rsquo;s language learning in terms of their experience with their first language (L1) and second language (L2) as is currently the case in the Primary School Curriculum. The language curriculum should provide a common structure for planning appropriate language experiences in all languages for all children in infant classes including those for whom English is an additional language.   This is a new way of looking at language acquisition which will help children&rsquo;s learning in all languages taught at primary level and into the future at post-primary level.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013/14 academic year.  A dedicated Capital Asset Test implementation group has been established. The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013/14 academic year. No decision has been taken on the treatment of farm or other business assets. In the circumstances, I am not in a position to say at this time what assets may be included. However, any proposals in this regard will require further Government agreement and necessitate legislative amendment.</P>

My Department has published on its website an indicative breakdown of the 1,769 applications that were received for these panels.  My Department is now commencing the checking process in relation to these applications and when this process is completed individual teachers will be notified of the outcome of same. The panels set up in accordance with the arrangements set out in this circular will be used at a later stage in 2012 for appointments to full-time permanent teaching posts that are not otherwise required to facilitate the redeployment of surplus permanent and CID holding teachers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 102, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The fee remission scheme for family members of full time employees of universities is a historical one which was sought to be discontinued by Government in 1982.    Following a claim on behalf of affected staff, the Labour Court issued a recommendation in May 1986 stating that arrangements for existing staff should continue.  In making this recommendation the Labour Court stated that it had been influenced by the fact that concessions in the matter of fees were either expressed or implied terms of the conditions of employment of the staff concerned over many years.  In relation to new staff the Labour Court recommended that all parties should enter into detailed discussions on the matter.  Following this recommendation a Conciliation Conference took place in 1991 with agreement reached that while the fee remission scheme would apply to those employed prior to September 1992 it would not apply to staff recruited after that date.</P>
        <P>Details in relation to the costs and the numbers who benefited under the scheme are not readily available in my Department. I have asked the Higher Education Authority to contact each institution concerned seeking such details and I will arrange to have same forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. Given the level of demand on the student grant budget from first time students and students that are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the arrangements in place.</P>
        <P>In the scenario presented by the Deputy, a student who already holds a Level 8 undergraduate qualification and intends to pursue a second undergraduate degree at the same level is not considered to be in progression and cannot be considered for funding, regardless of whether grant aid was made available to pursue the previous qualification.  However, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The major building project for the school referred to by the Deputy was included in the five year construction programme and is listed to proceed to construction in 2015/2016.  The building project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The design team are currently working on completing the stage 2(b) submission which will then be submitted to my Department for review.  For the purposes of the 5 Year construction programme new school building projects as well as major extensions have been prioritised on the basis of meeting demographic needs in areas where such needs have been identified.</P>
        <P>Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the funding available each year for the provision of school accommodation to meet the increasing demographic requirements it has not been possible to advance all projects to construction concurrently.  In the meantime, for works that are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to consider if the works in question might qualify for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Works Scheme. An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening. Details of the Scheme, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>From the commencement of the 2012/13 school year, the use of the Catchment Boundary Area (CB) System as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering post primary school. This means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.  This change was announced as part of Budget 2011 but is not being introduced until the 2012/13 school year in order to allow parents of children newly entering post primary school ample time to consider their school choice options, taking account of the revised school transport eligibility arrangements.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, the evidence is, as set out in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Schemes, that the majority of children are attending their nearest post primary school/centre.  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme will be applied equitably on a national basis.  Eligibility for post primary school transport is determined from where pupils reside and not from where they attend primary school.</P>

	<P>Pension schemes generally make provision for the payment of benefit where a member retires because of a medical condition the nature of which makes him/her incapable of discharging the duties of the occupation and is likely to be permanent.  Retirement on ill health grounds is a major decision that impacts both on the scheme member and the organisation. The award of pension in such circumstances must be grounded on a detailed assessment of the medical evidence in the case.  To this end, the opinion/recommendation of an appropriately qualified medical adviser must be obtained.  In this connection, where pension benefits are funded from monies provided directly or indirectly by the Oireachtas, the Minister has directed that the services of an Occupational Physician must be used by the organisation when assessing a scheme member&rsquo;s application for ill health retirement pension benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Occupational Physician, reviews the medical evidence, may conduct a medical examination of the member and then makes a recommendation outlining whether or not the member is incapable by reason of infirmity of mind or body of discharging his or her duties in the occupation and also whether or not that infirmity is likely to be permanent.  The position in relation to the application for ill health retirement benefit by the person to whom the Deputy refers is that the assessment has been carried out and it has been determined that the person in question is not incapable by reason of infirmity of mind or body of discharging his/her duties.  The person to whom the Deputy refers has been fully informed by the Pension Unit of my Department of the procedures in respect of ill health retirement applications and provided with information regarding the appeal process.</P>

	<P>The overall allocation for postal and telecommunications services in my Department for 2012 is &euro;2.64 million. This funding is provided in my Department&rsquo;s Administrative Budget, subhead A4. The 2012 allocation represents an increase of approximately 10% over actual expenditure in 2011.  The reason for the increased provision in 2012 is twofold:</P>
     
        <P>a) Some flexibility is required in relation to the cost of postal services due to the fact that the volume of materials posted to schools can fluctuate significantly from year to year.</P>
     
        <P>b) The 2012 allocation also includes, for the first time, funding for the postal and telecommunications cost of a number of regional offices. Prior to 2012 the administrative costs of the regional offices in question were provided for in a separate subhead which has now been discontinued and the funding has been allocated instead to a number of other subheads including subhead A4.</P>

	<P>The allocation for my Department&rsquo;s office premises expenses for 2012 is &euro;2.34 million. The funding is provided in my Department&rsquo;s Administrative Budget, subhead A6. The 2012 allocation for subhead A6 represents an increase of approximately 43% over actual expenditure in 2011 (&euro;1.635 million). The reasons for this level of provision in 2012 are as follows:</P>
     
        <P>a) An allocation of some &euro;0.4 million has been provided to allow essential building works to be carried out in my Department&rsquo;s premises in Athlone, Dublin and Tullamore.</P>
     
        <P>b) Additional funding of some &euro;0.138 million has been allocated to provide for the cost of security services in my Department&rsquo;s Marlborough Street premises.  The additional funding for 2012 is required in order to provide for the cost of this service for a full year. Prior to June 2011 the Office of Public Works met the cost of security services in Marlborough St.</P>
     
        <P>c) The 2012 allocation also includes some &euro;0.171 million to meet the office premises expenses of a number of regional offices. Prior to 2012 the administrative costs of the regional offices in question were provided for in a separate subhead which has now been discontinued and the funding has been allocated instead to a number of other subheads including subhead A6.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. </P>
      
        <P>In addition to psychological assessment NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them and processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations, on behalf of the state Examinations Commission,.  NEPS also provides a service to children with visual impairment irrespective of the school which they attend.  The main focus of NEPS is on early intervention with pupils and staff in schools in order to maximise pupil potential, to combat school failure and to avoid acute crises for children and young people. </P>
      
        <P>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention.</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">NEPS has a regional structure with some 23 offices nationwide providing service to schools where NEPS psychologists individually would normally be assigned to a mix of both Primary and Post-Primary schools in the immediate catchment area.  In December 2011, with a complement of some 173 staff,  NEPS psychologists provided direct service to 86% of primary schools (representing 91% of pupils) and 93% of post-primary schools (representing 94% of pupils) nationally. As previously stated the remaining schools received assessment services under the SCPA. Overall expenditure on the Service amounted to &euro;17.63m (&euro;14.92m staff pay, SCPA &euro;0.57m and &euro;2.1m on N/Pay costs).</P>

	<P>A9 is a new subhead for 2012 to cover costs to my Department of our Presidency of the EU in 2013.  The provision of &euro;175,000 is made up of &euro;137,000 for pay costs and &euro;38,000 for non-pay costs.  The pay provision is for additional full time and part-time staff for the Presidency, including two interns who are to take up duty in the Irish Permanent Representation in Brussels from July of this year and will be reporting to the Education Attach&eacute;. No expenditure has been incurred from this pay provision to date.  The non-pay costs are mainly for Presidency-related foreign travel, associated with attendance at preparatory meetings with the Commission, Council Secretariat, Presidency Trio colleagues and other stakeholders, on which expenditure of some &euro;7,000 has been incurred to date.</P>

	<P>The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) had a combined exchequer outturn for current expenditure of &euro;12.935m in 2008, when the decision to amalgamate those agencies into a single qualifications and quality assurance body was announced. Their 2011 exchequer outturn for current expenditure amounted to &euro;6.918m, a reduction since 2008 of 46.5%.  Closer co-operation and sharing of resources in preparation for amalgamation has been one of the factors that has enabled the agencies absorb the reduced exchequer allocation.</P>
     
        <P>The increase in the 2012 allocation for current expenditure over and above the outturn for 2011 is to meet unavoidable once-off costs arising from the amalgamation, in particular relating to accommodation and ICT.  Overall, the annual savings directly attributable to amalgamation are expected to be in the order of &euro;1 million. Some of these savings have already taken place, for example through the appointment of a single Chief Executive Officer for all of the agencies concerned, and further significant savings are being achieved through shared accommodation and corporate services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A number of changes to the School Transport Schemes were introduced from the 2011/12 school year and derived from recommendations contained in the Value for Money review of the School Transport Scheme. As a consequence of the combined changes a number of  services were withdrawn in respect of the 2011/12 school year. In such cases, families of eligible children may still apply for the remote area transport grant.  These changes form part of the overall requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget by 2014.  Similarly, the reduction in the School Transport Allocation for 2012 does not refer solely to a cut in the number of school transport services but rather is part of these savings and efficiency measures.</P>

        <P>Foreign Language Assistants are undergraduates or recent graduates who study modern languages. A total of 110 assistants come to second-level schools in Ireland each year under bilateral cultural agreements.  They receive a monthly allowance from my Department.  The most recent intake was 60 French, 30 German, 2 Austrian, 12 Spanish and 6 Italian.  The Foreign Language Assistants are selected by the cultural services in their own countries.  Irish undergraduates serve as Language Assistants in these countries.  They receive monthly allowances from the host countries.  A breakdown by age or gender is not readily available.</P>
        <P><i>Postgraduate scholarships</i></P>
        <P>My Department also funds a one-year reciprocal postgraduate scholarship scheme for international students.  To date, the purpose has been to meet the terms of international agreements and educational exchange agreements with Ireland&rsquo;s international partners.  Ireland has concluded cultural agreements with Belgium, Czech Republic, China, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, and Spain. Ireland also has educational exchanges with Australia, Chile, Japan, Hungary, Switzerland and Turkey. </P>

	<P>The B.5 subhead, entitled &ldquo;Research and Development Activities&rdquo; has two components.</P>
              <P LI="1">1. Research and development.</P>
             <P LI="1">2. EU projects.</P>
            <P LI="1">1. Research and development.  The purpose of the Research and Development subhead (B5.1) is to fund individual researchers and research institutes for specific educational research projects.  A Departmental Research and Development Committee assesses applications for funding, reviews progress of research projects supported by the Committee, and considers means for dissemination of results obtained. Expenditure totalling &euro;150,823.22 was incurred in 2011. This included funding for two research projects:</P>
     <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />Valuing Visibility: an exploration of how sexual orientation issues arise and are addressed in post-primary schools. </P>
     <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />Action Research project to develop a religious education curriculum for delivery in Community National Schools. The project commenced in July 2008 and it is envisaged that the project will continue until a religious education programme has been developed for all classes from junior infants to sixth class.</P>
             <P LI="1">2. EU projects. The main purpose of this provision is to make a national contribution towards the administrative costs of the national agency which administers the EU Lifelong Learning Programme in Ireland, which is L&eacute;argas, the Exchange Bureau.  The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 (LLP) comprises four sub-programmes supporting cross-border mobility, networking and sharing of best practice. Erasmus deals with mobility activities for those participating in third level education.</P>
     <P LI="1" el="0">Leonardo daVinci is the vocational education and training action.  It funds mobility and project activities for trainers and trainees. Funding under this action is available to public and private bodies and institutions involved in vocational education and training. </P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Grundtvig covers activities by adult trainers and learners. Comenius deals with activities by schools, teachers and pupils. </P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Under the Lifelong Learning Programme, the European Commission provides funding to beneficiaries and project promoters and partners.  This funding is administered by the national agencies in the member states in the case of decentralised actions and by the Commission in the case of centralised actions.  Expenditure from this subhead on EU projects relates to the administrative costs of L&eacute;argas in running the Lifelong Learning Programme, rather than to the costs of the programme itself which are fully funded by the Commission.  There is no co-funding requirement.</P>

	<P>In 2011 there were 130,679 training places provided by my Department funded support services for teachers. This figure includes the primary and post primary sector. Each year Vocational Education Committees (VEC) are allocated funding for the delivery of a Continuing Professional Development programme for Youthreach, Senior Traveller Training Centre (STTC) and Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) staff.  The most recent returns from VECs indicate that 44,636 training hours were provided.</P>
        <P>The amount of time a teacher spends on in-service varies in accordance with school and Departmental priorities and the availability of resources.  Current priorities include Project Maths and literacy and numeracy.  My Department also provides funding to the Management Bodies and the National Parent Councils for the provision of training to parents and Boards of Management.  In 2011 there were 1,486 training places provided in both Primary and Post Primary sectors. There will be an increase in the number of participants in 2012 given that there are new Boards of Management in place at primary level.</P>

	<P>The NCCA&rsquo;s 2012 allocation reflects an increase of &euro;.077m (8%) on the 2011 outturn which my Department considers sufficient to allow the Council to continue to fulfil its statutory obligations as laid out in the Education Act 1998.  A core element of its work for 2012 is to continue to support Junior Cycle reform.  It is important to note that reform will be introduced on a phased basis. The reform will commence for students beginning junior cycle in September 2014 and the first examination of the reformed Junior Certificate will be in 2017. </P>

	<P>There are six projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas which receive allocations from subhead B8 of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Four of the projects are administered by the VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County (2) and Dun Laoghaire; my Department also provides each VEC with an allocation towards administration costs.  The remaining two projects are administered directly by my Department. The attached table shows details of the allocations provided to the six projects in 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P>A review of the six projects was carried out in 2011. As a result of the review, four of the projects have received allocations in 2012 similar to their allocations in 2011.  Two of the projects have had their 2011 allocations reduced by 10%. These projects involve outside facilitators delivering the substance use aspect of the Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum in schools. Following the review, it was considered that, in line with best practice guidelines issued to schools by my Department, the classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work consistently with students on the SPHE programme.  There are no plans to extend funding to other projects under subhead B8 of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>

	<P>There were no projects or schemes that failed to access funding under educational disadvantage schemes administered by my Department in 2011 or 2012. The 1% decrease alluded to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the allocation for B10 Educational Disadvantage (Dormant Accounts Funding) in 2012, of &euro;1.6 million. This allocation is some &euro;13,000 or 0.81% less than the outturn under B10 Educational Disadvantage (Dormant Accounts Funding) in 2011, but is sufficient to cover existing commitments. There are currently three Educational Disadvantaged Schemes administered by my Department, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Scheme to enable DEIS Schools in Limerick City to open after school hours;</P> 
       <P LI="1">2. Access Programmes in the Institutes of Technology;</P> 
       <P LI="1">3. Pre-Schools Education Initiative- Equality and Diversity Training.</P>
     
        <P FLI="0">All of the above schemes will conclude in 2012, once all the approved funding has been drawn down by recipients.</P>

	<P>At the end of December 2011 the Redress Board had accepted 15,404 applications of which 14,855 had been processed resulting in 13,915 awards. A total of &euro;866.58m was paid out in awards and &euro;166.34m was paid in legal and associated costs. The Board&rsquo;s annual report provides a more detailed breakdown of the legal payments to solicitors in any one year.   At end 2011, the Redress Board had a further 1,474 late submissions to be considered.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2011, further expenditure associated with the Indemnity Agreement amounted to &euro;9.6 in respect of court awards, settlements and associated costs.  I have provided a breakdown of the age profile, gender profile and country of residence.</P>
        <P>Up to the end of 2011, a total of approximately &euro;2.79 million in funding was provided by my Department to Irish based groups representing survivors of institutional abuse. In the same period, just over &euro;5.14 million was paid to the Survivor Outreach Services based in the UK. In addition to this, approximately &euro;36,000 was paid in miscellaneous expenditure, primarily to groups who were not in receipt of regular annual funding from my Department but who would have been involved in various meetings with Government in the context of redress related issues.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement there are four designated areas of cooperation in the area of education; special education needs, educational underachievement, teacher mobility and school, youth and teachers exchanges.  My Department funds a number of initiatives in these four areas. A list of projects currently funded is attached as Appendix A for the deputy&rsquo;s information.  In relation to the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme, this programme provides third level scholarships to enable US university graduates to pursue a year of study at institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  A list of the third level institutions which George Mitchell scholars have attended is attached as Appendix B.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide a list of schools that are currently waiting for the upgrading to the school broadband service; and the percentage of the amount paid on wages to those persons employed to upgrade the school broadband scheme. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Schools Broadband Programme services are secured by my Department on behalf of schools through a public tendering process.  All schools wishing to avail of broadband under the Programme are currently in receipt of the best available connections within resources.  As the Deputy will be aware, broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location. However, since the commencement of the Schools Broadband Programme there has been a significant increase in bandwidth capacity. This is due to improved bandwidth speeds being made available to schools and the substantial reduction in the number of schools who are connected via satellite. Schools are only offered satellite connections where no alternative was offered during the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The schools Broadband Programme has been re-tendered and an evaluation of responses is currently taking place. New contracts for the supply of services will be awarded shortly. It is expected that under the new contracts there will be further increases in the overall availability of bandwidth provided to schools within the current budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2011 &euro;3m was paid to internet service providers.  Information regarding the element of the broadband contracts which relates to providers&rsquo; wage costs is not available.  In addition to the current broadband scheme, the Government has approved the roll out of 100Mbit/s broadband to all post primary schools. This is a joint initiative between this Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The national roll-out will be completed over three stages with 203 schools being connected by September 2012, a further 200 being connected next year and the remaining 250 schools being connected in 2014.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the agreed arrangements, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will provide the capital investment and current costs for each school for the year of installation and also for the first calendar year. My Department will pay the current costs for connectivity thereafter which is estimated at &euro;8.1m. For this year, this Department will pay &euro;1.2m which is the current costs for the 78 schools that were in the pilot project and this amount is included in the 2012 Estimate for my Department.</P>

	<P>Teachers in Primary Schools are paid salary in accordance with the Common Basic Salary Scale. This scale ranges from &euro;30,904 to &euro;59,359 for those whose first appointment was prior to 1st January 2011 (full details in Circular 04/2010). For those Primary Teachers whose first appointment was on or after 1st January 2011, the salary scale ranges from &euro;27,814 to &euro;53,423 (full details in Circular 40/2011).  The cost of the Supervision and Substitution scheme in 2011 was &euro;61.2m including Employers PRSI.

        <asker> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> if the reduction in school capitation grants has resulted in the loss of caretaker or secretarial services. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22542/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware Budget 2012 provided for a 2% reduction in the funding for capitation and related grants to primary and second level schools in both 2012 and 2013 and a further 1% in 2014 and 2015.  Due to my decision of 21st February last, to retain posts from previous disadvantage schemes in DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 primary schools, it was necessary to generate alternative savings within the primary education budget. This has been achieved by bringing forward to this year 1.5% of the 2% reduction in overall capitation funding originally scheduled for 2013.</P>
        <P>The Boards of Management of schools are responsible for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers and it is a matter for each school to determine the level of secretarial and caretaking needs required for the school.  Funding to cater for these needs is made available from my Department under two separate schemes. One is the 1978/79 scheme under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and the school secretaries are paid directly through my Department&rsquo;s payroll. The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools. While these specific ancillary services grants were not reduced in Budget 2011 the overall capitation funding available to schools was reduced.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Circular 0040/2009 provides that capitation funding paid to schools for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.  I cannot provide specific information on the effect, if any, the reduction in capitation funding to schools has had on the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. However, my Department has not received any communication from schools that would indicate any reduction is such services.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy is aware I announced an initiative to replace rented prefabs in schools in March of this year. Almost 200 schools were been offered an opportunity to replace rented prefabs with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;35 million has been allocated for this initiative in 2012. Approximately 80 schools have now been given approval to proceed with the replacement of their rented prefabs at a cost of &euro;14m and the remaining 110 schools will be finalised in the coming weeks. This new initiative will provide additional savings on the rental of prefabs in these schools in the coming years.</P>
        <P>Details of school accommodation currently being rented by primary and post-primary schools is outlined on a county by county basis in the following table. Please note that one prefab unit may consist of one or more classrooms and/or ancillary accommodation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>The number of retired teachers in receipt of pension benefit under the Primary School Teachers Pension Scheme is in excess of 13,000.  The number of retired teachers in receipt of pension benefit under the Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme is in excess of 9,500.</P>
        <P>The Pension Unit of my Department is currently compiling detailed statistical data on the number of teachers who retired in the period up to February 2012.  When compiled, this data will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the number of teaching posts that have been cut as a result of the 2% reduction in spending for second level teaching salaries and the percentage of this budget that is paid to teachers teaching within the private school sector. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22545/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has protected education as much as it can. Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools. But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford.</P>
        <P>The Budget 2012 measures in relation to the post-primary sector are set out in the documentation that was published by my Department last December.  This envisages a net overall reduction of about 450 posts at post-primary level between the current school year and the 2012/13 school year.  This net reduction in posts takes account of the impact of the budget measures, demographics and the budget decision to shelter all the DEIS post-primary schools through a reduced staffing schedule of 18.25:1.</P>
        <P>The final overall staffing position for all schools at post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> if he will provide figures for the numbers of students who dropped out of third level education as a result of a cut or decrease resulting in the higher education grants scheme, the VEC&rsquo;s scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for PLC students. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22548/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The HEA is responsible for the collection of data on student progression. The most recent report by the HEA entitled &lsquo;A study of Progression in Higher Education&rsquo;, published in October 2010, is available on the HEA website.</P>
        <P>The proportion of new entrants in 2007/08 who were not present one year later was 15% on average across all sectors and NFQ Levels.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy will appreciate that a number of factors influence progression in higher education, and the study shows that prior educational attainment is a significant factor. My Department does not collect data in relation to the impact of reductions in the student grant on retention rates in further and higher education.</P>
        <P>In the context of the current economic circumstances, difficult choices have been made by the Government to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability. Despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances, my priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access, to the greatest extent possible, for the most disadvantaged students to further and higher education.</P>
        <P>It is worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions. In addition, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.</P>

	<P>The number of teachers who retired from primary and secondary schools in the months of January and February 2012 is 1166. The compulsory retirement age where applicable is generally attained at the end of the school year in which the teacher reaches age 65 years.  Accordingly, no compulsory retirements are included in this figure. Information is not available on a regional basis.  The Pension Unit of my Department is currently compiling detailed statistical data on teacher retirements for the months of January and February 2012.  This information will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>Staff who joined the Civil Service prior to 1 April 2004 are required under current legislation to retire at the maximum retirement age which is 65 years of age.  Staff who joined the Civil Service after 1 April 2004 and are classed as new entrants, as defined in section 2 of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, are not required to retire at 65 as the maximum retirement age was removed under this Act.  There are changes proposed, which will change the retirement age for all civil and public servants in the new Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011. However, these changes will only apply to new entrants from a specific future date.  In addition we are required under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF to reduce numbers in the Public Service.  Allowing staff to stay beyond age 65 would significantly impact on our ability to reduce the overall numbers in the Public Service as retirement has been the primary driver in reducing numbers.</P>

	<P>Kildare County Council prepared a Pre-Feasibility Report in relation to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the Lower Morrell River, which includes the Alasty, Killeenmore and Turnings area, near Straffan, earlier this year. Following discussions with Office of Public Works officials, it was agreed that the council should apply to the OPW for funding to undertake a full feasibility and cost benefit analysis for the scheme. The council submitted a formal application to the OPW last month and a decision will made shortly in this regard. The viability or cost of possible mitigation measures is not known at this stage.</P>
        <P>Kildare County Council, in consultation with the OPW,  has investigated the possibility of carrying out interim flood relief works to alleviate flooding in the area but the council has not been able to identify an engineering solution which was economically viable and environmentally sustainable.  The OPW understands however that the council will undertake a programme of light maintenance works on the channel later this year, which should help the situation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I published the Credit Guarantee Bill on Tuesday 3rd   April, and I will be progressing this legislation through the various stages in the Oireachtas over the coming weeks.  In terms of timelines, the Government hopes to enact the legislation by the end of May.  Following the enactment of the legislation, it is envisaged that the Scheme will be going live shortly thereafter.  A contractor was selected in February to operate the scheme, a Maynooth based company called Capita Asset Services Ltd, following a public tendering process.</P>
        <P>The Scheme is intended to address two distinct barriers to lending; inadequacy of collateral (Pillar 1) and inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology (Pillar 2).  It will be exclusively targeted to address these particular market failures.  Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan are the target of the scheme.</P>
        <P>This Scheme will support new lending, encourage investment and company growth, save jobs and facilitate the creation of new jobs, and will boost trade. Term loans, other instruments with term loan-like structures, performance bonds and invoice finance will be covered by the Scheme.  The minimum permissible loan value will be &euro;10,000 and the maximum will be &euro;1,000,000.  Use of the Scheme is focussed on facilitating additional new lending, with refinancing of existing debt explicitly excluded.</P>
        <P>The Scheme will facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending per annum.  The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, on the basis of each tranche of &euro;150m of additional lending to SMEs, include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Over 1,300 jobs created.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Over &euro;25m of exchequer benefits in tax revenues and welfare cost savings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Participation in the Scheme is open to all lending institutions who are able to satisfy a series of accreditation criteria focused on regulatory status and compliance, relevant SME lending activities, capacity to undertake additional lending and a commitment to behavioural change leading to greater innovation in SME lending. The accreditation process will be managed by the Operator.</P>

	<P>I wish to acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed by your constituent regarding the introduction of the European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 which were signed into law on 29 February, 2012.  However, I would like to explain that this legislative measure concerning injunctions against intermediaries has been introduced to clarify the situation that arose following a High Court Judgment in the case of EMI and others -v- UPC.  This judgment held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the High Court now has significant guidance in the implementation of the legislative measure which has been introduced arising from the underpinning EU Directives, as interpreted by the recent Court of Justice of the European Union case law, to ensure that any remedy provided will uphold the following principles:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I would like to point out that I am determined to ensure that Ireland will be a premier location where innovation can flourish and where innovation is facilitated by our copyright laws.  In this regard, I am committed to reviewing and updating the Copyright legislation currently in place in order to strike   the right balance between encouraging innovation and protecting creativity.</P>
        <P>In this context, please note that the Copyright Review Committee published a wide-ranging Consultation Paper on 29 February, 2012 which examines the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation.  The Consultation Paper is a discussion document which sets out issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties on foot of an initial consultation process held during the summer of 2011 (in the region of 100 submissions were received during the initial consultation process).</P>
        <P>The fundamental aim of this Paper is to begin the process of sketching reforms to Irish copyright law to further innovation without denying protection to those who need copyright law to innovate.  I would specifically refer to Chapter 6 of the Review Committee&rsquo;s Consultation Paper which is concerned with intermediaries and it is stated that &ldquo;One of the main questions for the present Review is whether the copyright balance between rights-holders and intermediaries now requires further amendment,   in particular to incentivise innovation.&rdquo;  If any interested party has any concerns in this regard, I would suggest that they engage with this review process.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that in the seven month period since the announcement of the closure of Talk Talk in September 2011 there have been 12 IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to Waterford city and county. There were a total of 11 such visits to Waterford in each of 2010 and 2011.  Following on from the Talk Talk closure announcement, I directed that a report be prepared to investigate the particular issues affecting Waterford City and its hinterland and to outline a list of actions to be taken over the short and medium/long term to seek to address those issues. I launched the South East Employment Action Plan, which contains specific actions to address the specific unemployment problems affecting the South East, on 2nd December last and it is my intention to meet regularly with a forum representing the agencies and stakeholders to progress the implementation of the Plan.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the structural challenges that the South East region faces have built up over many years and will not be reversed with a simple set of actions.  What is required is to build a stronger enterprise base in the region as a whole.  The Action Plan identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition of having a stronger local enterprise base, but this will achieve only so much. There are challenges for all agencies in the region to help build up the region&rsquo;s competitive advantage and then to promote it in a coordinated manner.  In fact, one of the key issues that no single agency or Government Department can hope to address is the issue of the overall coherence of the region&rsquo;s &ldquo;value proposition&rdquo; to investors from home or abroad. What has arisen again and again in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and agencies in the region is the need for greater co-ordination of effort from all those with an interest in improving the enterprise potential of the region.</P>
        <P>In the case of IDA site visits, a company is generally shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements. The South East Employment Action Plan includes a commitment by the agencies to assign a clear priority to the South East region.   In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland will endeavour to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to visit and where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.  Meanwhile, we must not lose sight of the fact that at present there are 31 IDA Ireland client companies employing 5,196 people in Waterford city and county.</P>

        <Quest> if she will continue with the payment of domiciliary care allowance to the parents of children with autism; her views that this is a payment to assist children who need extra care; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was originally introduced in the early 1970&rsquo;s in recognition of the extra care and attention provided by parents of children with a severe disability, who are cared for in their own home.  The qualifying conditions for the scheme require that the child is under 16 years of age and has a disability so severe that it requires care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months. </P>
        <P>Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted and no specific condition or disability rules a child in or out of qualifying for the allowance.  It is important to point out that applications for children with autism are processed in exactly the same manner as applications for children with other types of disability.</P>
        <P>Prior to the transfer of the DCA scheme from the HSE in 2009, an expert medical group examined the scheme and made recommendations on how it should operate within the Department.  These recommendations included the need for a review process and the minimum term that should apply to such reviews.  A review policy is an integral part of all social welfare schemes and is necessary to ensure that payments continue to be made only to those customers who meet the qualifying conditions.</P>
        <P>DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either (i) a scheduled review on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed or (ii) on information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</P>
        <P>Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child&rsquo;s disability and how their care needs may change over time.  Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child versus a child of the same age who doesn&rsquo;t have their disability.  This information is assessed by a medical advisor and a decision is made based on the medical opinion they provide.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer is invited to submit any further information they may wish to have considered and that information is further examined and/or they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the person in question has been in touch with my Department on a number of occasions and that a reply has  issued to her on the queries raised by her which are similar to those raised here in this question. I also answered a parliamentary question on April 18th 2012 in relation to issues raised.  I would again like to take this opportunity to outline why changes have to be made to pension provision. Social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly and the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this.   </P>
        <P>The decision to make changes to State pension provision was taken in a budgetary context together with the changing demographics in Ireland and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The number of people over age 65 is projected to treble by mid-century, by which time it is also expected that there will be less than 2 people of working age to every person aged 65 or over (compared to 6 today) with the associated increased in expenditure on State Pensions.  It is for these reasons that State pension provision has to change and the change to the rate bands is one of the measures planned which aims to increase the sustainability of the Irish pension system.  Ireland is facing the same challenges other countries are facing and has taking similar steps.</P>
        <P>Considerable consultation has taken place in relation to the State pension including a Green Paper on Pensions which was published in 2007 followed by a national consultation.  Furthermore I have commissioned the OECD to review the long term pension policy in Ireland.  A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.</P>
        <P>Recognising that the State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.  This has always been part of our pensions system and changes to State pension contributory provision which were announced in Budget 2012 put an increased emphasis on this.  Recipients of the State pension contributory who have contributed more will receive a more generous pension. For example, currently a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension contributory of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.</P>
        <P>To address this, a change to the rate bands was one of the reform measures announced in Budget 2012. The rate of State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be proportionate to the rate band appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  Furthermore, the principle that the amount of pension paid should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the number of contributions paid ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. This is fair and equitable and puts us on a more financially sustainable track.</P>
        <P>With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 (24 and 47 for State pension transition) yearly average contributions will be replaced with new rate bands of between:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />40 and 47 yearly average contributions,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />30 and 39 yearly average contribution, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />20 and 29 yearly average contributions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therefore, the rate of State pension transition or State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be more appropriate to the average number of contributions paid over a working life.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.  While existing pension recipients are unaffected, the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.</P>
        <P>The  total contributions approach, due to be implemented in 2020 and referred to in the question, will mean that the rate of pension payment made  will be directly related to contributions made over a working life. The changes to rate bands due to commence in September 2012 goes somewhat towards this process. However, the averaging system, which is currently used will remain in place until the total contributions approach is implemented in full in 2020.</P>
        <P>The homemaker scheme referred to, makes qualification for the State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This scheme can be more beneficial to women as they are more likely to have periods of caring for children or incapacitated persons.</P>
        <P>The homemaker disregard (or credit) will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  I have no plans to back date this scheme.  In relation to raising awareness of the changes to State pension, an information campaign has been undertaken by my Department where the changes to State pension have been extensively outlined to all of the representative organisations and members of the public.</P>

	<P>The Government put in place a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.   Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.  An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Last year my Department wrote to known owners of land and rights in the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation to inform them of the cessation of turf cutting on these sites and to invite applications for compensation. Advertisements were also placed in local and national newspapers. Over 1,700 applications for compensation have been received to date under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme and more than 380 payments have been made.  Over 1,300 applicants have received acknowledgement letters from my Department. In addition, officials from the Department have contacted almost 300 applicants in the last few weeks to up-date them on the status of their applications and to discuss the compensation options available to them.</P>
        <P>Payments have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the scheme in the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme application form. My Department has been checking and will be continuing to check that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met. In this regard, my officials have been working closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as successor of the Land Commission, Bord na M&oacute;na and the Property Registration Authority to assist people to provide the necessary proof of legal interest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2007 EU Eel regulation (1100/2007), drafted in response to the endangered status of the European Eel, required EU States, including Ireland, to develop Eel Management Plans.  Based on the scientific facts available, a recommendation of this plan was that Ireland closes both the commercial and recreational Eel fisheries in 2008.  The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification. </P>
        <P>I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery is being applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context, I am sure the Deputy will also appreciate that in the current economic climate the Government does not have funds available to provide for compensation payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together. </P>
        <P>The Better Energy Homes scheme provides fixed grants to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes through insulation and heating upgrades.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme provides insulation services free of charge to vulnerable fuel poor homes, through a combination of Community Based Organisations and private contractors.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers both of these schemes.  One key component of scheme governance is to ensure that the works have been completed to an appropriate standard.  Inspections are conducted in accordance with checklists issued by the SEAI which assess conformance to the technical specifications for the works as published by the SEAI.  The inspections are undertaken by an outsourced third party appointed by the SEAI in accordance with Public Procurement Guidelines.  Until recently inspections under the separate schemes were subject to two separate contracts, both of which were awarded to Carillion, following Invitation to Tender Procedures conducted through <i>www.e-tenders.gov.ie</i> and the Official Journal of the European Union.</P>
        <P>In order to verify compliance with the requisite standards, under the scheme, SEAI implements a technical inspection regime in accordance with the SEAI&rsquo;s detailed Quality Assurance and Disciplinary Procedure.  A percentage of properties are inspected by suitably qualified personnel, in accordance with published checklists, to ascertain compliance with relevant aspects of the Technical Specification and Code of Practice.  The overall technical inspection rate for the scheme has been around 11% of installations.  The rate of inspections and the targeting of inspections is being enhanced by SEAI to ensure, among other requirements, that both large and small or new contractors are appropriately and proportionately covered under the technical inspection regime.</P>
        <P>While technical inspections are largely, but not exclusively, focused on quality assurance, SEAI is currently implementing much greater use of prepayment verification inspections across all categories of installations and contractors as well as a programme of ongoing enhancement of scheme assurances and controls.</P>
        <P>In August 2011, the SEAI commenced a procurement process with the aim of consolidating the contracts for inspections and related services across the Better Energy Programme.  The procurement process was completed in full compliance with the Public Procurement Guidelines.  The SEAI published the Request For Tender (RFT) on the   e-tenders website and in the Official Journal of the European Union on 25th August, 2011 with a closing date for receipt of tenders of 4th October, 2011.  The stated objective of the RFT was to appoint an organisation to provide the SEAI with a range of survey, inspection and related quality assurance services in accordance with the quality assurance objectives of the Better Energy Homes schemes.</P>
        <P>A total of nine tenders were received by the deadline which were evaluated by an expert selection panel and scored in accordance with the published selection criteria and weightings.  The selection panel met with a number of the tenderers in order to clarify aspects of their submissions.</P>
        <P>The selection panel recommended the appointment of Kerrigan Sheanon Newman (KSN), a Dublin-based company, to the contract which was approved by the Board of the SEAI in December 2011.  Approval is, in accordance with the published RFT, initially for a one year period and thereafter, subject to satisfactory performance, for a further period of two years.  All bidders were notified of the outcome and the contract notification cooling off period commenced.  Engagement of the winning bidder by the SEAI and transition from the incumbent service provider, commenced in mid-January.  The contract value is estimated at &euro;1.9m per annum, excluding VAT.  The service is managed on the basis of a Services Contract (template published at time of RFT) and a Service Level Agreement with agreed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), monitored and managed by the SEAI.</P>

	<P>Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, <i>inter alia</i>, through the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines) and provision for mediation procedures between neighbours.

	<P>As part of the Unfinished Housing Developments Public Safety Initiative, launched by my Department last year, unfinished housing developments fall within four categories:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</P>

        <P FLI="0">In circumstances where a developer is still active it is the responsibility of the local authority planning department to pursue the developer for completion of the development in line with the terms of the original planning permission. Similarly, where a developer is inactive but still in place the enforcement of the planning conditions is a matter for the relevant planning authority.</P>
        <P>All capital investment projects funded by my Department are subject, <i>inter alia</i>, to EU and national public procurement requirements and guidance, as set out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, relating to capital project management in the public sector.

It is open to contractors to submit tenders under the relevant procurement processes, unless precluded by any of the conditions which apply to the competition, which include meeting requirements in respect of financial standing including tax compliance, insurance, ability to obtain a bond and technical capability.</P>

International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption, and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.  Mains rehabilitation does not address customer side leakage and does not impact on consumer behaviour. Mains rehabilitation needs to be sustained as part of long-term strategy complementary to metering rather than instead of it.  Progress in relation to water conservation and water mains rehabilitation is set out in reply to Question No. 106 of 2 May 2012. </P>

	<P>The Control of Dogs Act, 1986 requires every local authority to employ one or more persons to be dog wardens for the purposes of the Act.  The legislation does not specify the exact local arrangements to be made for implementation purposes, and no differentiation is made in the provisions dealing with nuisance by barking dogs between private property and local authority housing.  The legislation has been in place for some time and it is a matter for the authorities themselves to determine the most appropriate arrangements, including administrative arrangements, for purposes of implementation.</P>

	<P>Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise from any premises, processes and works.  The Environment Section of the relevant City or County Council is the appropriate contact point for reporting a noise nuisance in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department periodically meets with representatives of local authorities through the Environmental Enforcement Network (EEN). The key objective of the EEN is to foster co-operation between public service bodies involved in the enforcement of environmental legislation, including noise, so that a higher and more consistent standard of enforcement is achieved throughout the country. The legislative options for addressing noise complaints have been discussed at previous EEN meetings and I am satisfied that local authorities are broadly aware of their powers under Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations provide the legislative basis for the household charge. Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.   The exemptions from payment of the household charge are: residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction; residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive; voluntary and co-operative housing; residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling; residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts; and residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).  The waivers which apply concern: owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, and owners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.</P>
        <P>I have established an independently chaired Inter-Departmental expert Group to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation based property tax.  The Group will complete its work and make recommendations to me shortly. Following consideration of the Group&rsquo;s recommendations, I will bring proposals to Government on the full property tax as soon as possible. It will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the structure and modalities of the full property tax.</P>
        <P>In relation to water pricing, Irish Water, which will assume the operation of water services from local authorities, will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills.    For example, a wide range of flexible payment options are available for the other utility services and it is expected that these will be replicated for water services.  The Regulator will address affordability issues, including in respect of persons with medical conditions, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Social Protection in the context of developing a water pricing framework.</P>

	<P>The licensing authority for the purpose of motor tax and driving licences in Wicklow is the County Council and the administrative arrangements for the provision of services by a local authority within its functional area are a matter for that authority.  Most motor tax transactions can be done by post or online and driving licence applications can be made by post and, accordingly, such transactions do not require a visit to a motor tax office.   However, I understand that there is an area office in Bray, which opens three mornings a week with the facility to process motor tax applications.  I envisage that decisions on the delivery of motor tax services at local level will remain a matter to be determined by the relevant licensing authority.   Future delivery of the driving licence service is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</P>

Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.environ.ie</i> or on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at <i>www.housing.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 226 together.</P>
        <P>The key objectives of my Department&rsquo;s Community Division are to facilitate integrated development at local level and foster vibrant, sustainable and inclusive communities; and to support the Community and Voluntary Sector in its contribution to an active, democratic and pluralist society.  My Department continues to be responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), the Seniors Alert Scheme, RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) Programme, the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector and the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.</P>
        <P>The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to enabling rural communities to become self sufficient has been reaffirmed this year through increased funding for Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER Axes) of the RDP giving a total allocation for 2012 of &euro;96 million. The LEADER approach ensures that communities are involved and have a say in their own development choices.</P>
        <P>In terms of future approaches, the government is committed, under the Programme for Government to reviewing the delivery of local and community development functions by exploring options to improve the alignment of these functions with those of local government.   In this regard, I refer also to the reply to Question No. 54 on today&rsquo;s Order paper.</P>

	<P>Given the reduced level of capital resources available under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, there is a shift away from the traditional local authority housing construction and acquisition programmes towards more flexible funding models based around the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and using more limited Exchequer funds to leverage private finance for the delivery of new housing supply.</P>
        <P>With a view to making optimum use of the capital funding available under the housing programme over the 2012-14 period, I intend to announce details of a 3-year programme of new local authority housing construction and acquisition later this year. Local authorities were requested, in October 2011, to submit proposals for projects to be advanced in 2012 and the following two years. Authorities were advised that priority consideration will be given to projects that complete earlier phases of projects, provide small infill developments and/or can leverage additional housing units through a combination of capital and leasing monies. It is not possible at this stage to provide details of individual projects or the numbers of housing units to be delivered under the programme.</P>

	<P>Fire services are provided by the 37 statutorily designated fire authorities. The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>
        <P>The cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have full-time fire services, and Drogheda and Dundalk have a combined full-time and retained service.  Fire services in all other communities are provided by the retained system where, in the event of an emergency call, the relevant group of fire-fighters are alerted, respond to their fire station and turn-out to the incident in their fire appliance.  The retained services provide an excellent model of service delivery where, to a substantial degree, a contingent rather than continuous capability is required.</P>
        <P>The national blueprint for the future development of the fire services, including improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, is set out in the Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015.  The Framework sets out key actions in the areas of Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Guidance on Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and legislative support. The Framework was developed and approved under the aegis of the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, which is also managing the implementation of its actions.</P>
        <P>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is currently engaged in stakeholder consultation with a priority project titled &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;.  It sets out an integrated approach to efficient fire safety in Ireland through achieving an appropriate balance between prevention of fires, having appropriate fire protection facilities in place in buildings and through appropriate and effective fire brigade response.  The draft policy proposes guidance and standards for fire service delivery underpinned by a risk categorisation approach which matches identified risks with the appropriate prevention and response.</P>
        <P>Following stakeholder consultation, it is intended that the finalised policy document will be completed by the end of summer 2012.  &ldquo;<i>Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;</i> will then be circulated to all fire authorities for implementation.  I expect that each fire authority will review its approach to fire safety in light of the guidance and recommendations in the document, and plan for any adjustments in current arrangements in the period 2012-2015.  The &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo; draft document is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i> via the &ldquo;Public Consultations&rdquo; link which can be found on the home page under the heading &ldquo;Popular Topics and Quicklinks&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>My Department provides funding towards group water schemes by way of annual block grant allocations to local authorities, including Kildare County Council, under the Department&rsquo;s Rural Water Programme.  Responsibility for the administration of this programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual group scheme proposals for funding and advancement under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.  The 2012 allocation for the Rural Water Programme is &euro;40 million, of which over &euro;20 million was notified to local authorities last March by way of block grant allocations towards group water schemes. The allocation notified to Kildare County Council was &euro;110,000.  In addition, group water schemes can qualify for subsidy funding towards their operational costs. This subsidy scheme, for which some &euro;21 million is being provided this year, is also administered by the local authorities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
        <P>The responsibility for zoning lands for specific purposes is a matter for planning authorities through their development plans and local area plans.  Under the Planning Acts, the making, amending or revoking of a local area plan (LAP) is a reserved function of the elected members of the planning authority for the area.  Furthermore, under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, there is a mandatory requirement to make a LAP in respect of a town with a population in excess of 1,500 persons except where the planning authority decides to indicate objectives for the area of the town in its development plan, or a LAP has already been made in respect of the area of the town, or objectives for that area have already been indicated in the development plan.</P>
        <P>Under Section 19 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, a planning authority may, not more than 5 years after the making of a LAP, by resolution defer commencing the review process for a further period not exceeding 5 years, extending the lifetime of an LAP for a stated period, where the members have:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />notified the manager of their decision and the reasons; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />sought and obtained the Manager&rsquo;s opinion that the LAP remains consistent with the objectives and core strategy of the relevant development plan, and the objectives of the LAP have not been substantially secured.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 13 May 2008 in accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Arising from the refusal of the asylum application of the person concerned, he applied to be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1999 (as amended). This application was approved which gave rise to the fresh, and ultimately unsuccessful, consideration of his asylum claim.</P>
        <P>As a result from the refusal of this asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31 August 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  This refoulement consideration will include a detailed assessment of the prevailing political and human rights conditions in the country of origin of the person concerned. Additionally, all representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was granted temporary permission to remain in the State in 2000 under the arrangements then in place for the non-EEA parents of Irish born children.  This permission was renewed subsequently and the latest permission expired on 30 November, 2010. I am informed that the person concerned applied to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to have his permission renewed prior to December 2010. However, his registration was not processed due to concerns regarding his being part of a family unit.</P>
        <P>The person concerned then wrote to the Irish National Immigration Service in January 2011 to seek permission to remain in the State.  He was requested to provide documentation regarding his family circumstances and his finances.  Some documentation was supplied by the person concerned in March 2011 but was insufficient to prove his family circumstances and further documentation were requested during 2011 and again in January 2012.  The requested full documentation was finally received on 9 February, 2012 in INIS and following recent consideration of his case file, my officials will be writing to the person concerned very shortly regarding the renewal of his permission to remain in the State.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was granted temporary permission to remain in the State in 2002, under the arrangements then in place for the non-EEA parents of Irish born children.  This permission was renewed on a regular basis and is currently valid until 30 June, 2012.  I would advise the person concerned to contact the Administration Section of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to obtain a record of her reckonable residency in the State for naturalisation purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  One of these conditions is that the applicant must have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements.  The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator can be used as a guide to whether an individual satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.</P>

	<P>Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, <i>inter alia</i>, through the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines) and provision for mediation procedures between neighbours.  The development of new noise legislation by my Department will be considered in the context of this commitment; however, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme published on 17 April 2012, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the legislation will be published, having regard to other priorities in the area concerned and the broader range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.</P>

	<P>In the first instance I should mention that nationals of the Philippines are required to be in possession of a visa prior to seeking entry to the State.  It is open to any visa required national to submit a visa application for any purpose.  Each visa application will be considered on its individual merits, the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why the visa sought should be granted.  Any further information/supporting evidence that it is wished to have taken into consideration should be included where a visa application is submitted.  It should be borne in mind however, that the provision of the suggested evidence in no way guarantees that a visa will be granted.  Furthermore, it does not limit the discretion of the visa officer in dealing with individual applications.  Guidance information as to the visa application process (including a link to the on-line application form) can be found on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website &mdash; (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).  It should be borne in mind however that the information contained on the website is intended to act as a guideline only.</P>

This Act provided for the superannuation benefits of public servants, who retired within a &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; which ended on 29 February 2012, to be unaffected by the pay reductions introduced for all public servants with effect from 1 January 2010 under that Act.  In the period 1 January 2012 to 29 February 2012 a total of 12 public servants who retired from my Department or agencies under my aegis were located in Waterford.  Of these, a total of 5 had reached minimum retirement age, 6 availed of the Cost Neutral Early Retirement scheme and 1 person retired on Ill-Health grounds.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the roles assigned to them in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including Government Agencies such as the National Park and Wildlife Service, (NPWS).  As part of the efforts to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the EU ban on turf cutting in Special Areas of Conservation, the NPWS submitted a request to the Department of Defence seeking the transport of NPWS personnel in Air Corps aircraft to monitor these areas.  The Department of Defence follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour.  For these missions, the Cessna aircraft has been used and the average hourly direct cost of operating this aircraft which include fuel and maintenance costs is &euro;185.  The cost to-date in 2012 of providing assistance to the NPWS is &euro;13,690, (based on approximately 74 hours of flying time).</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda&iacute; as required in a range of duties.  As part of this role, the Defence Forces maintains an anti-riot capability in order to meet a contingent and operational capability at home and overseas.  It is essential therefore that all military personnel involved be appropriately equipped.  In 2010 and 2011, expenditure on personal protective equipment was &euro;132,500 and &euro;474,935 (excl VAT) respectively.  The equipment procured included personal protective equipment for use by the Defence Forces in public order and crowd and riot control operations at home and overseas.  In relation to 2012, a tender competition for the acquisition of protective visors for the Defence Forces which can attach to in- service helmets, is in train.  The cost of the visors will be determined by the tender competition.</P>
        <P>The purchase of this equipment was planned as a replacement programme and is required to enable the Defence Forces train and carry out its roles at home and overseas to the highest possible international standards and best practice.</P>

The new Supervision Mission will monitor a cessation of armed violence &ldquo;in all its forms by all parties&rdquo; in Syria.

The remaining 19,418 farmers that exited REPS 3 during the remainder of 2011 were not eligible to apply for AEOS in 2011.  I am now actively considering the possibility of re-opening AEOS to allow for the submission of applications either on an amended basis from the existing scheme and/or on a limited scale, including the possibility of re-opening for applications later in the year with a possible closing date for applications of end September and a commencement date of January 2013.</P>

	<P>The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 has an overall value of &euro;4.9 billion over a 7-year period of which &euro;2.5 billion will be funded by the EU and &euro;2.4 billion by the National Exchequer.  Current expenditure under the Programme amounts to close on &euro;3.2 billion, being 65% of its total value.  While the Programme ends in 2013, spending may continue under certain schemes until the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;396 million has been allocated to fund measures such as on farm investment and other schemes under Axis 1 of the Programme, which promotes competitiveness and innovation.  An amount of &euro;4.148 billion has been allocated to Less Favoured Areas and the Reps and AEOS schemes under Axis 2 which fosters the environment and land management.  Apart from a small amount for technical assistance, the balance of the funding, being &euro;353 million, has been allocated to the remaining part of the programme which supports the quality of life and diversification of economic activity in rural areas.  This part is administered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government using the Leader approach while the Rural Broadband Reach Scheme is administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>All funding under the Programme is committed at present. Spending is monitored on an ongoing basis with funds reallocated and Programme amendments proposed as necessary.  This process will continue until the Programme ends with a view to ensuring full draw down of all EU funding within the available budgetary allocation to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently undertaking a review of the Commonage Framework Plans.  My Department is co-operating with the review which will revise permitted stocking levels based on the current condition of commonages.  It is expected that the review will be completed by end of June.  The revised stocking levels will form the basis of future sustainable management plans to protect against both over and under grazing of commonages.  Officials from the National Parks and Wildlife and my Department, are in discussion with the farming organisations on the implementation of the revised management plans.  Any new Agri-environment Options Scheme will have to take account of the outcome of the review of the Commonage Framework Plans.</P>

In common with Agriculture Ministries from other Member States, I and my Department are now awaiting official confirmation from the Libyan authorities of the lifting of the ban.  The Deputy will understand however that the timing of this official confirmation is in the gift of the Libyan authorities and I cannot pre-empt any announcement by them.</P>
        <P>My Department can however ready itself in anticipation of the lifting of the ban.  Once official confirmation is received, the next step will be to agree a veterinary health certificate with the Libyan authorities which will set out the conditions under which the export of Irish beef can take place.  My department has already sent a draft certificate to the Libyan authorities for their consideration, so that we are as prepared as we can be once the ban is officially lifted.</P>

	<P>I am aware that concerns have been raised with regard to welfare issues and sheep EID tagging and that the matter has been discussed by my officials with a number of farming organisations.  The Deputy will also know that it is a matter I addressed in a statement recently.  The Deputy should be aware that some 100 million sheep in the EU are all identified under the tagging regulation (21/2004).  There does not appear to be a problem, in general, with sore and infected ears post tagging across the Union as long as appropriate practices are observed.  These includes correct placement of the tag in the ear, tagging at the correct time of year in order to avoid fly strike and also the disinfection of equipment and the sheep&rsquo;s ear prior to tagging each animal.  These guidelines are outlined in a booklet that I am forwarding to each flockowner in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department has and will take a pragmatic approach to applying the European rules in these cases.  If a farmer has sheep with infected ears post tagging then he can seek veterinary advice from his own practitioner.  If the advice is to remove the tag(s) then the sheep farmer should record the event in his/her farm flock register and retain the removed tags.  The affected sheep should be re-identified as soon as possible after the ears have healed &mdash; correlating the new tag number to the removed tag number.  If the farmer follows this procedure there should be no issues on cross compliance for animals that have had their tags removed on animal welfare grounds with veterinary advice.  I can assure the Deputy that my officials will work with farmers in finding solutions to any legitimate problems that may arise.</P>

	<P>Further to the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Question, I can again confirm that the changes referred to relate to the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the changes to the rules governing which have recently been published by my Department. I can also confirm that booklets outlining the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme are currently being printed and will shortly be posted to all farmers with DAS-designated land. However, as these proposals have yet to be approved by the EU Commission, they may be subject to change.</P>
        <P>That said, insofar as the specific enquiry of the person named is concerned, the requirements under the 2012 Scheme are as follows: In the first instance, an applicant is required to have met a stocking density in 2011, for three consecutive months, of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare. Thereafter, while the minimum stocking density remains at 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for 2012, the applicant must meet the minimum stocking requirement for six consecutive months during the scheme-year, in addition to which, the applicant is also required to meet an annual stocking density average of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, which will be calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</P>
        <P>However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a lower stocking requirement of an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plan, Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS). All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the<i> </i>  process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</P>

	<P>Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me.  It is an important element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which is currently under consideration at the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards and has taken a number of initiatives in this regard.  On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines potential measures to help reduce discarding.  </P>
        <P>The Irish fishing industry secured the support of the EU North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council (NWWRAC) for measures to reduce discarding of haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea at the end of last year.  The NWWRAC has submitted these measures to the EU Commission recommending their adoption at EU level as early as possible.   The Irish industry has also supported, as an interim measure pending the introduction of the measures at EU level,  quota management arrangement that incentivise the use of these measures by the Irish fleet.   I have made available to Irish vessels who use the recommended modified fishing gear an additional 40% of haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea since the beginning of April.</P>
        <P>The measures for the Celtic Sea are an important initiative in reducing discards.  The Discards Atlas for Irish fisheries was the first publication of it&rsquo;s kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The Atlas identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. The Atlas will also inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy,</P>

	<P>Thirty three City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) were established in 2001 by the then Office of the Minister for Children under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 to co-ordinate a strategy to promote and develop quality childcare throughout the country. The CCCs are composed of local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, social partners, childcare providers and parents.  There are four committees in Dublin City and County to provide for the four local authority administrative areas within the County. </P>
        <P>The  CCCs offer a wide variety of services locally that include advice on setting up a childcare business, childcare information sessions, and co-ordinating training courses for those working in the childcare sector and those considering a career in childcare.  Services are also provided to parents, such as information on local childcare facilities and  parent networks.  The CCCs also play a very important role in the implementation of  the three childcare support programmes funded by my Department.  Pre-school services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Under the Regulations, pre-school services, including childminding services taking care of more than 3 pre-school children, are required to notify the Health Service Executive (HSE) of their services and the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE carry out inspections of these pre-school services with the objective of securing the health, safety and welfare of children attending them.</P>
        <P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is implemented by my Department and provides a free pre-school year to eligible children. In the region of 95% of pre-school services throughout the country are participating in this programme.  The CCCs continually monitor the programme in order to ensure that all parents benefit from the free pre-school provision as intended.  In addition, Pobal &mdash; as an agent of my Department &mdash; also carry out site visits to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the programme.</P>

	<P>The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, published in 2011,  provides greater clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First and the Heads of the Bill have been prepared and submitted to the Committee for Health and Children for their consideration.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the proposed legislation could give rise to a significant number of reports being made to the HSE and I am cognisant of the need for an effective filtering system to be put in place. In this regard, &ldquo;Guidance for Reporting of Abuse&rdquo;  is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will be dependent on designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Mr. Gordon Jeyes, HSE National Director Children and Family Services has given me an assurance that all referrals when initially received are assessed and the action taken is prioritised by risk.  In addition, the new Child and Family Support Agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services is to be established. A new model to deal effectively with referrals  is being developed to ensure that all child welfare and protection reports receive a service promptly from the range of family support services and child protection services available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In the vast majority of cases, the renewal of a medical card by a GP is not necessary as the Primary Care Reimbursement Service is currently dealing with new applications and renewals in a speedy manner.  Renewal notices are issued 3 months before a medical card expires and in the case of most persons who return completed applications their renewals are completed within 15 working days.  The latest information from the PCRS indicates that 93% of complete medical card applications are processed within 15 working days.</P>
        <P>A medical card holder who genuinely engages with the review of their medical card will not have their entitlement withdrawn before that review is complete.  This period of continued eligibility is further extended if the person appeals the non-renewal of a card or the granting of a GP visit card.  To avoid a situation where eligibility ceases because the client was unable to respond to a renewal notice, an additional safeguard is now present in that a GP can, where appropriate, extend eligibility to allow the medical card holder a further opportunity to engage with the review process.</P>

	<P>Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year.  Ireland&rsquo;s public health policy objective in relation to tobacco is to promote and subsequently move towards a tobacco free society.  The document <i>Towards a Tobacco Free Society</i> was adopted as Government policy in 2000 and continues to be the main strategic document guiding the development and implementation of policy measures and services to reduce smoking in Ireland.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group will be reporting to me shortly.</P>
        <P>The report of this group will build on our existing policies and legislation<i>.  </i>This group is examining a number of areas which need to be developed or enhanced in order to reduce smoking prevalence in Ireland including the possibility of extending the smoking ban to other areas e.g. cars with children present, educational and health care campuses, playgrounds, public parks, beaches etc. The report will also examine how to develop our cessation services in order to support those people who want to stop smoking.  Of major concern to me is the number of young people who are still taking up the habit.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;denormalisation&rdquo; of smoking within our society is key tool in stopping our children and young people from doing so.  To achieve this we must make smoking less attractive to children and increase its social unacceptability.  I understand that in order for such initiatives to be successful they must be supported by the public.  It is also important, however, that everyone in society recognises their role in effecting change in our lifestyle behaviours such as smoking for the benefit of everyone.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware smoking is the largest single cause of preventable mortality in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people every year.  Evidence shows that pricing is a key tool in the efforts to control smoking and in particular preventing children and adolescents from taking up the habit.   Just last week an international group of health economists and tobacco control experts (PPACTE) called for an increase in the taxation of all tobacco products as the most effective way to make them inaccessible to consumers.  As you know this Government increased the excise duty on tobacco products in the last budget.  The Tobacco Policy Review Group will be reporting to me in the near future and is considering the issue of  excise duties on tobacco products.  I am of the view that increasing tax on tobacco together with the strengthening of policy, services and programmes will be effective in reducing smoking prevalence in this country.</P>

	<P>The HSE funds over 2,500 organisation, which operate over 4,100 separate funding arrangements to a value of approximately &euro;3.3 billion. These organisations vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community based organisations providing social care services. The HSE National Governance Framework regarding funding of non-statutory organisations commenced in 2009 and was rolled out to all agencies in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Framework sets out the requirement that all agencies in receipt of State funding must sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This policy was put in place to ensure accountability, probity and good governance in relation to spending of State funding.  The HSE had made the organisation referred to by the Deputy aware of the Framework in 2008.   Part 1 of the SLA document is generic to all organisations and cannot be changed and Part 2 allows for specific details of the organisation&rsquo;s role and services to be inserted.  Signing the SLA does not compromise the confidentiality of the work of the organisation.</P>
        <P>Discussions are continuing with the organisation referred to by the Deputy regarding its SLA for 2012 and funding has been provided to meet fixed cost commitments, pending agreement to the terms of the SLA.  The organisation, however, through its legal advisors, is refusing to provide supporting documentation relating to its accounts for previous years to the HSE, and does not believe that it should be subject to an SLA for the funding it receives.  The organisation received  a sum of &euro;558,355 in 2011.  Organisations with functions similar to the one in question have signed SLAs for 2012.  For the reasons above, I am fully supportive of the HSE&rsquo;s position in ensuring accountability for State funding.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest> if he will review the insurance scheme in place by the Health Service Executive for individuals with hepatitis C in order to exclude the two year lead in time for the mortgage protection part of the scheme in view of the fact that this was an unanticipated problem in the scheme, which has led to persons not being able to move house as banks will not make available mortgages without mortgage protection in place. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2006 provides the statutory basis for the establishment of the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme which commenced in September 2007 (SI 31 of 2007).  This Scheme provides, subject to certain limits, life assurance, mortgage protection and travel insurance to those who were infected with Hepatitis C and/or HIV through the administration within the State of contaminated blood or blood products. </P>
        <P>In each case the person requiring insurance pays the average basic premium which an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay.  The Scheme pays the additional premiums levied or covers the additional risks that would otherwise prevent a policy being taken out.  Under the Mortgage Protection part of the Scheme there is a lead-in period for benefits.  Since September 2008, which marked the end of the first year of operation of the Scheme, and the end of the open period for entry into the Scheme, there is a waiting period of two to three years for persons over 30 years, depending on the age of the person applying for the mortgage protection policy.  Such a waiting period is necessary for mortgage protection and life assurance policies under the Scheme, to guard against the possibility of adverse selection.</P>
        <P>There was significant consultation involved in establishing the Scheme and a Steering Committee was set up to advise on all aspects of implementation. The Committee included the interested support groups &mdash; Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are fair and reasonable.</P>

	<P>During 2011 the Health Service Executive was considering a proposal to close St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Crooksling.  However, following court proceedings in relation to another proposed closure it became clear that it was not appropriate to make a decision to close a hospital such as St. Brigid&rsquo;s without a comprehensive consultation process.  In this regard the public consultation process in relation to the proposed closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital at Crooksling will commence shortly.  This will involve engaging with residents, relatives, staff, public representatives and any other party who wishes to make a submission.  The consultation process will be completed within a period of three months from commencement, at which point a final decision will be made regarding the future of the hospital.  Meanwhile the HSE is undertaking works at St. Brigid&rsquo;s to ensure compliance with current HIQA standards.  These works are due to be completed by 30 June 2012.</P>
