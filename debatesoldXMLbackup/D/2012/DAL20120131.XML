      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 131 on 18 January 2012, in which I indicated that a total of 16 staff from across my Department had at that stage confirmed their intention to retire between that date and the end of February.  This included one member of the professional staff of the National Monuments Service of my Department and a small number of technical and professional staff from its National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The latest estimate of the total number to retire across my Department is 20.  I am confident that, with continuing effective management of my Department&rsquo;s resources, the quality of the services it provides will be maintained.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for the legislative framework in respect of national monument sites, for general policy development in the area and for measures to promote better awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage.  The Office of Public Works undertakes the operational management and general maintenance of all national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Any retirement issues in that office would be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department deploys a regional force of around 230 staff to manage national parks and reserves and to carry out a range of nature conservation functions.  Once there is full clarity regarding the small number of retirements expected from this service, my Department will consider any issues arising in light of the available financial and human resources.  I can assure the Deputy that all necessary resources will continue to be directed towards the protection, conservation and development of our built <Col N="208" />and natural heritage, in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  According to Mr. Peter Cox, vice-president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, Ireland, every euro invested in heritage returns between &euro;300 and &euro;400 to the Exchequer.  Writing recently, Mr. Cox, a man with considerable experience in the field of heritage, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has now lost a number of senior staff and the few left at this level are so overstretched and underfunded they can no longer promote or protect our national monuments.</P>
        <P LI="1">It is expected that 60 per cent of senior heritage specialists in the public service will apply to retire in February, which will leave the sector bereft of expertise required to manage national monuments, ordinary heritage and even world heritage sites.</P>
        <P LI="1">Within five years, cultural tourists will not visit Ireland because our heritage sites will be in poor repair, ill-interpreted and some will have to close because of health and safety restrictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I ask the Minister to clarify whether this scenario will be realised.  Cultural and heritage tourists spend significant sums in this country.  The budget placed a strong emphasis on tourism as a mechanism for job creation and assisting the country in emerging from its current economic difficulties.  Will the Minister comment on Mr. Cox&rsquo;s view of the future of the heritage sector given that he is an independent professional working in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I concur with the Deputy that our heritage sites are very much part of our tourism industry and a large number of tourists come here to visit them.  Only one member of the Department&rsquo;s professional staff, an archaeologist, is due to retire.  I do not know from where the figure suggesting that 60% of heritage specialists will retire came or on what basis the article in question, which appeared in one of the national newspapers, was written.  There does not appear to be any grounds for it.  Having checked with the Office of Public Works, the number of OPW staff retiring in the coming months is also relatively low.  The number of heritage specialists will be only minimally affected by forthcoming retirements.  I assure the Deputy that information provided by my Department and the Office of Public Works suggests the figure of 60% does not have any basis.</P>
        <P>Despite the fact that all Departments are working in constrained circumstances, the emphasis on our built and natural heritage remains as strong as ever in my Department and the Office of Public Works, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has responsibility.  Deputy Troy can rest assured that our focus on this area will be maintained this year and in the years ahead.  Funding for the built and natural heritage was hard hit between 2008 and 2011 and was, unfortunately, further reduced this year because all Departments were required to reduce capital expenditure.  I tried to protect funding as much as I could and remain convinced that sufficient resources remain available to continue the service of conservation, protection and promotion.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest>    the efforts he is making to protect and enhance the music industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>The support available for my Department and the agencies under its aegis for music is very significant.  We will provide more than &euro;2.6 million in grant aid to the National Concert Hall in 2012.  It, in turn, is the home of the National Symphony Orchestra and our premier music venue.  My Department also provides in excess of &euro;1.6 million in 2012 to Comhaltas Ceoltoir&iacute;&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Tax relief to support the music industry, and particularly for new and emerging artists, has traditionally been provided through the business expansion scheme.  Investors could avail of tax relief in respect of music recordings under the business expansion scheme for music, which was specifically designed to stimulate investment in the production, publication, marketing and promotion of new and emerging musical talent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department also funds targeted initiatives for music which are channelled through Music Network. These include national music day and a national music instrument scheme, Love Live Music.  The national music day, is an annual celebration of all forms of music in Ireland.  It aims to promote access to live music for all, regardless of location or circumstance, through free nationwide music events. Music day in 2012 is 21 June to coincide with international music day.</P>
        <P>The musical instrument scheme, operated by Music Network, assists individuals and groups to purchase instruments.  Up to &euro;200,000 is available under the scheme this year.  My Department is also providing &euro;100,000 to the cross-Border youth orchestra in 2012.</P>
        <P>Expenditure supports to specific music organisations and for the music sector generally fall mainly within the remit of the Arts Council which, as the Deputy will be aware, is statutorily independent in the disbursement of its funds.  For example, the Arts Council supports major performing groups, such as the Irish Chamber Orchestra and Irish Baroque Orchestra which provide year-round work opportunities for the current generation of highly trained musicians; music promoters and festivals throughout the country, such as Sligo Live and West Cork Chamber Music; specialist resource organisations for music, such as Music Network and First Music Contact; and opera provision through Wexford Festival Opera, Opera Theatre Company and so forth.</P>
        <P>In regard to the matter of intellectual property rights, including copyright and royalties relating to the commercial aspect of the music industry, these are matters that fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he is aware, the music industry here plays an essential part in the Irish way of life socially, culturally and economically.  It is very important that it is not only recognised but supported, invested in and enhanced.  There are some very good examples internationally of how this might be done but one of particular note is the FACTOR scheme in Canada.  FACTOR, which stands for the Foundation Assisting Canadian Talent on Recordings, is a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing assistance towards the growth and development of the Canadian independent recording industry.  Support is provided to Canadian recording artists, songwriters, managers, labels and distributors through various programmes which all aid in the development of the industry.  The scheme supports many facets of the infrastructure which must be in place in order for the artists and Canadian labels to progress into the international arena.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister agree a similar scheme would be welcome in Ireland?  I have proposed that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht undertake a specific job of work to look at ways in which we, as legislators, might help establish an environment in which Irish music could grow and flourish.  Would the Minister be supportive of such an approach?   Does he believe there is scope to look at, for example, the criteria by which Irish music is defined as &ldquo;Irish music&rdquo; for the purposes of radio play?  This is something <Col N="210" />which has been done in France to good effect.  Will the Minister commit to look at international examples for best practice in regard to the promotion and protection of indigenous music?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware of the FACTOR initiative in Canada which has been very successful.  It started out very small with approximately $200,000.  Now approximately &euro;14 million is provided.  It helps songwriters and musicians and puts money into education which is very important.  We should look seriously at that programme.  I have already asked my officials to consider it to see if it can be replicated here in any way.  It has certainly been successful in Canada.  Coincidentally, there are a number of Irish artists who perform in America who are being funded by the Canadian Government.  They perform at Irish festivals, such as in Milwaukee.  There are Irish artists performing in such venues who may not get the same support from here, but who are finding it difficult to compete with them.  That in itself is an example of how effective it has been.  </P>
        <P>Irish music is thriving at the moment.  For example, last year, about half a million Americans saw Irish traditional music performances across America through Culture Ireland&rsquo;s support.  I was in New York recently at a major event to promote Irish artists.  Some of our top musicians were there, such as Martin Hayes and Frankie Gavin, who were attracting huge attention.  Their showcases were full to capacity, whereas showcases from other countries might have attracted only two or three people.  Irish music, therefore, is going through a very good spell internationally at the moment.  I agree with Deputy McLellan that we should avail of this opportunity and promote it as much as we can in whatever form.</P>
        <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the French policy on airplay.  There is a great man there, Danny McCarthy, who is promoting this and he has obviously been in contact with Deputy McLellan.  I think that if we had a similar quota here it would help.  In France, broadcasters are compelled to play local and national music as much as possible, through a special quota.  We should seriously examine that here, but I suppose it is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  It should certainly be considered seriously in conjunction with our national broadcaster.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputies to my previous replies on this matter.  I met the chair and chief executive of the Bank of Ireland and had a constructive engagement on the issues.  That positive dialogue is continuing with the Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>At the time of my initial suggestion, the future ownership of the bank was in question.  My raising of the issue was exploratory and it came to unintended public attention.  Clearly, too, it caught the public imagination.  This building was the first purpose-built parliament in Europe. <Col N="211" />Completed in 1739, the building served as Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801.  By extension, the question of its future use was entirely appropriate, given its resonances throughout public, cultural and civic life in this country.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a rich literary heritage, and this building was a forum for the great parliamentary orators of the 18th century.  In more recent years, the building has provided the backdrop for many iconic moments, including the addresses by two great political orators of our time, Presidents Clinton and Obama.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
        <P>Whether in the short or long term, I hope the Minister will push forward with the proposal to put the Bank of Ireland premises in College Green, Dublin, back where it belongs, which is with the people.  I also hope that the whole area of College Green can be pedestrianised so that people can take back a bit of the city.  Other cities like Barcelona, London, Amsterdam and Brussels have areas where one can sit down and relax without traffic noise blowing one out of it at every turn.  There is a fantastic collection of buildings in College Green with brilliant views, but it is a shame that one never gets the chance to enjoy them.  My main feeling when I am standing there is not to look at the wonderful architecture or the city that surrounds us; it is to get out of there as quickly as possible because I am either going to be run over or go deaf from the noise.  It would be brilliant if the Minister could push forward with this.  This will discommode some people but we get discommoded in rural Ireland as well and we try to deal with it.  It would be brilliant if something like this happens and the Minister can push for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan and agree with his vision, which is part of the vision I expressed to the Bank of Ireland.  I presented a slideshow for them showing how the area could become a plaza like Trafalgar Square or Times Square in New York or the many examples in Paris, Madrid and Tiananmen Square.  That could be our focal point and it is not overly ambitious to consider it.  Dublin City Council has similar plans.  The issue of traffic can be overcome.</P>
        <P>This was part of our bid for the UNESCO city of literature designation.  Our bid referred to considering providing a writers museum.  This is nothing new and I am not the first to come up with that vision for the Bank of Ireland.  In order to capitalise fully on the designation, we need a centre of literary excellence.  We have a very good writers centre and writers museum but these are not of the magnitude to celebrate the achievements of our four winners of the Nobel Prize in literature, Heaney, Beckett, Yeats and Shaw, and the totality of expression running from Swift to our present-day writers making a major impact on the world stage.  Members should try to agree to advance as much as possible.  It is a site of approximately 1.5 acres under cover in the entire Bank of Ireland College Green complex.  A small part of it would suffice to express the unique literary tradition of Ireland.  I acknowledge the support of Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan and agree with his vision for that part of the city, which should be shared among all of us in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  We were promised in the programme for Government that a social dividend would be returned for our massive investment in the banking system.  I am disappointed there has been little movement on this issue.  Has the Minister identified other sites as having potential for use for cultural purposes?  On a related point, what steps has the Minister taken to secure the future of 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin?  Does the Minister agree this is an unprecedented opportunity in the run-in to the 100th anniversary of 1916 to create a cultural quarter incorporating Moore Street and the surrounding streets and lanes, with the GPO at its centre, in the heart of Dublin city?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
        <P>It is similar.  We will give it a go anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>When it looked like Bank of Ireland was going into State ownership, it put the State in a much stronger position but that has now gone the opposite way.  If it was to go into private ownership, it would be important that College Green is preserved so that it does not pass on to an international bank.  We are in the early stages of discussion as regards the future of the Bank of Ireland College Green and we are considering iconic projects for 1916.  This is something we should consider as a nation in full co-operation with the bank.  The discussions I had with the bank have been quite positive but obviously it has major problems and challenges, not including the development of cultural facilities.  Any input I can get from this House is welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the social dividend, that is one of the reasons I pushed bank officials because if they co-operated with my Department and the Government there would be a dividend of goodwill for the bank, which it needs.  It would also send out a very strong message internationally that the bank, despite the circumstances it is now in, the Government and people could combine to produce something iconic.  In terms of the symbols of Ireland, the architecture of the Bank of Ireland building resonates with a lot of people around the world.  It is a site one sees representing Ireland a lot.  It was represented in images of State visits and dignitaries before independence and more recently during the visits of Presidents Obama and Clinton.  It has been the location for some of the great moments in Irish history.</P>
        <P>On 14-17 Moore Street, as the Deputy knows a decision was made by Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la before I became Minister.  I have been asked to look at the buildings and see how appropriate the proposal made by the developer is.  I have consulted widely.  There is a very enthusiastic all-party Oireachtas joint committee which is responsible for the next decade of commemorations.  We received presentations, visited the site and met those in favour of and opposed to the proposal, as well as those who have a bigger vision for the site.</P>
        <P>I have requested advice from the National Museum and have an open mind.  If the project does not go ahead it is unlikely we will see anything happening to the buildings in terms of preservation and conservation before the anniversary of 1916.  It is not within the capacity of the Government to provide the type of funding required to upgrade the site to the design proposed by the current developer.  The issue is under discussion.  I will bring a report to the Oireachtas joint committee.  Before I make any decision I will take the issue to Cabinet because I realise it is a major decision.  It is not something I am taking lightly.  Whatever decision I take will be endorsed by the Cabinet.</P>

T&aacute; an-chuid oibre d&eacute;anta ar Bhille na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, mar shampla.  T&aacute; cinn an Bhille sin r&eacute;idh chun dul os comhair an Rialtais gan mhoill.  M&aacute; t&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht an Rialtais le f&aacute;il, rachfaidh an Bille chuig an dr&eacute;acht&oacute;ir.

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I return to a foreign language.  My Department has a broad range of responsibilities in respect of the protection of the national heritage, built and natural.  It directly manages six national parks and 78 nature reserves; it owns several national monuments, which are in the care and management of the Office of Public Works; and it has responsibility for policy regarding world heritage sites, of which there currently are two &mdash; Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Skellig Michael.</P>
        <P>More generally, my Department is also responsible for policy and legislation in respect of archaeological and architectural heritage matters.  It works on a cross-departmental and inter-agency basis on many aspects of its business.  In particular, my Department works closely with the Office of Public Works in respect of issues such as investment in the conservation and <Col N="222" />presentation of historic properties and national monuments in State care, the management of world heritage sites and a range archaeological issues.</P>
        <P>Other key cross-cutting initiatives include the work of an expert group, established by my Department in May 2008, to undertake a comprehensive review of archaeological policy and practice and an expert advisory committee, set up in 2011 and representing key stakeholders, to review the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011 in respect of protection and management of architectural heritage.</P>
        <P>The heritage area is increasingly identified as crucial in developing the tourism sector and my Department is committed to promoting Ireland&rsquo;s rich heritage and in presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for tourism and sustainable inward investment.  In this regard, my Department is directly involved in developing heritage initiatives with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and other organisations to contribute to the quality of the national heritage tourism product.</P>
        <P>The issue of establishing further inter-agency groups over and above the initiatives I have outlined should be justified on the basis of need and in light of the priorities facing my Department at a time of reduced resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I was taken somewhat unawares with this question but nonetheless it is an area in which I have a particular interest.  Is the promotion of heritage tourism in the country generally carried out as part of the overall activity and work of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other agencies and within their yearly spend and investment?  Does the Minister not believe the time has arrived when we should extrapolate heritage as a tourism interest area from the main, overall promotion and try to sell it more aggressively in tourist markets?  I heartily concur with the remarks made by the Minister to the effect that heritage is a vital area and an important magnet for drawing overseas tourism to Ireland.  It seems there is a need to focus on this area and to set targets and objectives to increase the numbers of heritage-interest tourists coming to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I wish to put a supplementary question with regard to heritage sites generally, including the protection of architecture with which we are familiar.  The development of lesser-known sites may involve or require a capital spend by local community groups, local authorities or the Department.  Does the Minister envisage pursuing this aspect of the matter?  To give an example, I have in mind the Williamite War in the years prior to the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.  Several skirmishes occurred throughout County Louth.  The Battle of the Boyne has an central, important role to play in the evolution and development of Irish history.  Does the Minister not believe that such projects require a capital spend in order that people coming to Ireland who wish to further their knowledge and appreciation of the issues involved can visit sites that are clearly marked and where they can read tablets with suitable inscriptions on-site and at various points along the way?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s intervention.  Other countries possibly put a good deal more emphasis on world heritage sites than we do.  If one goes to Greece or Rome one sees a major emphasis being put on something designated a world heritage site.  There are two in this country, one near Deputy Kirk at Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the other at Skellig Michael in my home county.  We are considering the development of further United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO, sites and it is important that we do so.</P>
        <Col N="223" />
        <P>On a broader scale, the promotional literature used by Tourism Ireland throughout the world places a major emphasis on our iconic sites such as the Cliffs of Moher and Georgian Dublin.  Tourism Ireland is using our unique heritage, which is probably our unique selling point, as a major promotional tool to attract tourists to the country.  I agree with Deputy Kirk that there is scope to do more and to look beyond our iconic sites.  We should consider the position of sites throughout the country which may not be designated as national monuments or world heritage sites.  When one considers the success of other countries in this regard we have a great deal of untapped potential to further promote Ireland throughout the world as a country to visit from a heritage point of view.</P>

      <P>Now that the intergovernmental treaty has been finalised, will the Taoiseach ensure, as an urgent decision, that the public can be properly informed about the treaty by publishing an explanatory guide to it?  The people have not been kept informed adequately of the content of the treaty, what it is about or its objectives.  Essentially, the people have been kept in the dark for far too long about this process during the past six months.</P>
      <P>We are in the midst of the worst economic crisis the world &mdash; especially the eurozone &mdash; has seen since 1929.  We have seen how European Union leaders are grappling with this crisis which has threatened and is threatening the survival of the euro and the eurozone.  The people have responded in a constructive, responsible and resilient manner and we should trust the people&rsquo;s judgment.  We should accept that during a series of difficult years they have responded in a resilient manner to the issues.  Given the scale of what has taken place and what continues to take place &mdash; we are concerned about Greece and there are fresh concerns about Portugal &mdash; does the Taoiseach not believe it is morally right to consult the people on this treaty, especially given the centrality of our relationship with Europe with regard to our economic future and the future of jobs and so forth?  We should not be afraid of consulting the people on this issue.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that the Government has nothing to fear from a referendum.  The sense of bringing the citizens with us in terms of the European Union is an important concept and ideal.  Not only is this relevant to Ireland, it is relevant and applicable to all EU member states in terms of the degree to which citizens have been left behind in the context of the decisions taken by political elites at European Union level.  There are significant elements in this treaty, in terms of the ECJ and so on, that we would like to discuss at a future date, but the fundamental point is the need to consult with the people on this specific treaty.  Does the Taoiseach agree there is a need to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Martin is using peculiar phraseology today.  I assume that by saying &ldquo;consult with the people&rdquo; he is talking about holding a referendum, but he did not say that.  Deputy Martin&rsquo;s view yesterday and that of his party, which was espoused by Deputy Michael McGrath in a very constructive fashion, was that if a referendum was required in the context of changing the Constitution, it should be held.  That is the position.  I have been very clear about this.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Martin says that it is right and important that the people are properly informed, he can take it I agree with that.  The people will be properly informed.  The Deputy said they were not adequately informed over the past six months.  They have had a flavour of the discussions that have taken place, but Deputy Martin will understand that the final text was only agreed yesterday evening.  Therefore, the final text upon which discussions on the content will take place was only finalised by the Heads of Government at last night&rsquo;s meeting in Brussels.  As the Deputy is aware, this morning at the Cabinet meeting I asked for formal approval to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs write formally to the Attorney General, as <Col N="224" />is required, to seek formal legal advice on the question as to whether the text and wording agreed at yesterday evening&rsquo;s meeting is in compliance with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  As the Deputy is aware, then we change the Constitution or seek the right to change the Constitution if that is necessary.  The Government has asked the Attorney General for formal legal advice and that will be given in due course and the Government will act on the legal advice given by her.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure Deputy Martin supports fiscal discipline, proper budgetary oversight and the opportunities for growth and job creation, not only in this country but right across the eurozone and Union and that is what the discussions that took place at an intensive level since just after Christmas Day were concerned with.  We will have a discussion here tomorrow on the outcome of the meeting and will have ample opportunity to discuss the articles and preambles to the intergovernmental agreement agreed yesterday.  The Deputy may take it that the public will be properly informed as to what is at stake and in due course, when the Attorney General&rsquo;s formal legal advice comes to the Government, we will act in accordance with the precedent here.  I will wait to see what is the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he has neglected the public dimension to this debate and to the preparations leading up to the treaty to an alarming degree.   In December, we asked in the House for a special Oireachtas committee to be established to enable the issues around the treaty to be teased out by parliamentarians here, but the Taoiseach rejected that constructive suggestion of mine at the time.  The people do not want to be dismissed.  However,  with the way Ministers are approaching this, there is a sense that the people are being dismissed.  When a Minister says that referendums are anti-democratic, that leads people to think in the direction that they are being dismissed.  The comments made by Deputy Varadkar on the validity of a referendum raise that issue.</P>
      <P>I did not expect to get a clear answer from the Taoiseach on a referendum or legal advice and so on, although I believe the Attorney General has been all over this for the past number of months, as would be normal and natural.  What work was undertaken by the Government in preparation for this treaty in terms of its impact on the fiscal situation and future budgets?  Has work been undertaken and has an analysis been undertaken with regard to the impact of the treaty on future budgets and the parameters around those budgets?  Has there been an assessment of the impact of this treaty on jobs and job creation?  We read today that there is a 10.5% average unemployment rate across the 17 eurozone states.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that work has been undertaken by the Government with regard to the impact of the treaty?  Will he publish that work straight away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues will begin to be discussed tomorrow in the House here, following the normal report that I will give to the House following yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.  I expect that Deputy Hannigan, the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs, will see that plenty of opportunity is given to Deputies from all sides of the House to have their say on the text as it is agreed in this intergovernmental treaty.  I want the Deputy to understand that I have required every Minister and Minister of State to attend their meetings in Europe where appropriate as part of the ongoing work that is involved in this.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Creighton, who has responsibility for European Union affairs, has undertaken an enormous range of meetings informing our colleagues and peers of the work of Government.  At ministerial level, part of the work that occurs on a daily basis, concerns not just our programme for Government, but how this feeds into the European agenda.  I am glad, as I am sure Deputy Martin is, that at <Col N="225" />long last, jobs, employment and incentives in the Single Market will become a central feature of all of the agendas for European Council meetings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin spoke about consulting with the people.  He can take it that very adequate information will be provided to everybody on what is contained in this.  On the first Lisbon referendum, people felt they were not properly informed.  Of course the issues then covered a broad spectrum, ranging from questions about abortion to battlegroups and to transfers of competency.  I participated in a number of meetings with Deputy Martin then where we favoured a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on that referendum strongly.  However, remember that in November 2010, when the Government of which Deputy Martin was a member made a decision at Cabinet in respect of handing over the economic sovereignty of our State, that was followed by a period of denial where Minister after Minister said that everything was rosy in the garden, there were green shoots, we had turned the corner and the IMF&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This was at a summit which noted that 23 million people are out of work across the European Union.  Bh&iacute; an Taoiseach ag imirt an amad&aacute;in le Sarkozy &mdash; agus d&uacute;irt seisean go raibh an pobal as a gcloigeann.  How much extra austerity did the Taoiseach sign up to last night?  What extra cuts and tax increases on low and middle income families will be required to meet the new 0.5% deficit ceiling?</P>
      <P>In his state of the nation &mdash; or state of the State &mdash; address before the budget, the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;I want to be the Taoiseach who retrieves Ireland&rsquo;s economic sovereignty and who leads a Government that will help our country to succeed&rdquo;.  Yet last night he signed an austerity treaty that hands significant new powers over to the European Court of Justice and the European Commission, which are unelected bodies that impose economic policies on democratically elected Governments and which impose heavy fines when they believe these policies have not been adhered to.  The Taoiseach also doggedly refuses to give the people their democratic right to have a referendum.  How can he talk of restoring sovereignty on the one hand, and at the same deny citizens their democratic right to have a say on this treaty where he gives away more powers to unelected officials in Brussels?</P>

All Deputies in the Oireachtas should call for a referendum so that citizens will have their say.  The Taoiseach had fine words to say about jobs and growth, but there are no new plans, no new money and no new jobs.  There was not a single red cent &mdash; to coin a phrase &mdash; for job creation yesterday, but on 31 March the Government will pay another &euro;3.1 billion to failed banks.</P>

It will mean that on top of the &euro;8.6 billion the Government has already agreed to cut from the economy, people will have to pay for this.  Yet the Taoiseach has the audacity to say that the people are mad.</P>
      <P>I will ask the question again.  What will this treaty cost to lower and middle income families, in terms of cuts in their services and in terms of their taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a process to our democracy and part of it is to adhere to something that has been well tried and tested.  If we are to attempt to change our Constitution and if it is deemed necessary then the advice of the Attorney General is the process by which all Governments have followed over the years.  The referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 also involved a constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>I am sorry for the Deputy&rsquo;s friend and his family.  If he wants to continue to challenge the process by which we do our business here, then he has a duty himself.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn might think it is funny that 3,000 people lost their lives during that 30 year period, and he might want to forget it, but some of us do not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the cost, this intergovernmental agreement is not the answer to all of Europe&rsquo;s problems but it allows 25 of the 27 EU countries to sign up to a political process where fiscal discipline and proper governance of the economic affairs of each nation will be put into place.  This means that the funding for this country, which is in a programme for the next two years, as authorised yesterday by the full meeting, will continue as it will for any other country in a programme.</P>
      <P>It is for us here &mdash; not for Europe &mdash; to decide how we should close the gap in our spending over taxation.  That is a very serious problem, as the Deputy can understand.  We are taking out &euro;3.4 billion this year.  The Deputy wanted to close a gap of &euro;15 billion to &euro;16 billion in one year but the impact of that would be catastrophic.  The economic policies his party has been pursuing have been wild in the extreme.</P>
      <P>What is involved here is a process of ratification of this agreement, whereby the 25 countries that have signed up for this and the 27 countries of the EU will apply proper governmental standards to the running of their countries so that economies can grow, jobs can be created and the promotion of job opportunities is central to the agenda for the future.  We cannot do that unless we sort out our problems.  They will not be sorted unless we work with our colleagues and decide ourselves what we have to do.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Martin is well aware, the next ten years will see an annual payment of &euro;3 billion payment in respect of the promissory notes to Anglo Irish Bank.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the truth not that the fiscal compact is a treaty for permanent austerity and therefore provides for permanent attacks on the living standards and public services of ordinary Europeans?  Is the reality not that the obsession of the Government at the summit was to secure a wording for the austerity treaty that it hoped would avoid a referendum by having the initial German Government demand that austerity be enshrined in every constitution removed?</P>
      <P>Why did the Government not use the lead-up to the summit to lay down demands about the disastrous consequences of the bailout of the European financial system on the backs of the Irish people?  Why did the Taoiseach grossly undermine demands for getting rid of the Anglo <Col N="229" />promissory notes madness which will break the State when, in Davos and in front of the world&rsquo;s capitalist and media establishment, he carelessly blamed the Irish people&rsquo;s alleged greed for the financial crash instead of placing the responsibility with the crazed operations of the casino financial markets and their profiteering and speculation?  Is it any wonder photographs have appeared in the media around the world today showing President Sarkozy patting the Taoiseach on the head?  I noticed in some of the television shots that a number of other prime ministers also patted him on the head as they passed him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett">

      <P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be delighted with the Taoiseach for blaming the Irish people for the disaster of their system, paying billions to salvage Irish, French, German and other banks on the backs of the Irish people and then agreeing to austerity in perpetuity to pay for all of this.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Does the Taoiseach agree with his Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, DeputyVaradkar, that Irish people are essentially so stupid they would not be able to see what a referendum on the austerity treaty is about?  Does he agree with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that holding a referendum would not be democratic because people may have on their minds extraneous issues such as septic tanks or household taxes and would dare to think about bondholders and &mdash; wait for it &mdash; cutbacks as they voted?  According to the Minister, these issues do not have any connection with a referendum on austerity.  Does the Taoiseach agree that his Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is severely spatially challenged if he cannot join a few short dots to see precisely the connection between an austerity treaty, cutbacks, stealth taxes and a tax on living standards?</P>
      <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to hold a referendum, regardless of whether the Attorney General decides it is a constitutional imperative.  Does he agree that it is democratic to bring the matter to the people?  Has he noticed that according to one poll taken at the weekend, three quarters of people are demanding a say on the austerity treaty?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the position about the process of government is very clear and it is one I have outlined for the Deputy before.  The text was agreed last night by the Heads of Government and has been formally sent from the Cabinet to the Attorney General.  The Cabinet will await the advice of the Attorney General and, once received, I will so inform the D&aacute;il.  The Government will then act on the basis of the advice of the Attorney General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken this process very clearly and step by step.  I am sure Deputy Higgins, from his socialist perspective, wants to see circumstances in which people in his constituency can contribute to the good of their locality, economy and country.  Deputy McGrath may think it is very funny but people want to make a contribution.  No Government will be in a position to do its job unless we have a country where the economy is growing and thriving and in which jobs and opportunities can be created for our children, the next generation.  If the Deputy believes this will sort itself out by doing nothing, he is very much mistaken.</P>
      <P>What was concluded last night is a political agreement on a text for an intergovernmental treaty.  We have asked the Attorney General for formal advice on it and the Cabinet will act accordingly when that advice is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any inkling that what he agreed last night, namely, permanent austerity and cutbacks, will have a drastic effect on employment and bring about the opposite of job creation?  For the first time in a long while, I noticed cynical propaganda emerging from the European Union to the effect that the economic crisis is about to be turned around and there has been some talk of stimulus and so forth.  Will what was agreed not further depress the economies of Europe, causing further suffering for ordinary people across the Continent?  Is the Taoiseach aware that it has been notified today that unemployment in the European Union is at its highest for 14 years, with 16.5 million people unemployed?  Young people all over Europe are being cruelly denied a job and in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland the effects of austerity are disastrous.  How can the Taoiseach discuss job creation in the same breath as he defends an austerity treaty?  Will he explain his comments in Davos, which he has failed to do, when he carefully blamed the Irish people in total for the greed of a tiny minority?</P>
      <P>It was not me who underestimated the intelligence of Irish people but the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, who stated they could not distinguish between a treaty and other, albeit important issues which are on their minds.  Who is calling Irish people stupid?  Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister that a referendum is not an exercise in democracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins talks about cynical propaganda.  One of the central features of this informal Council meeting was that jobs and growth, the Single Market and small and medium-sized enterprises were the first issues discussed by the Council and will continue to be on the agenda of every Council meeting from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was window dressing to get the treaty through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, unemployment among young people is above average in eight or nine European Union member states, including in this country.  The Commission&rsquo;s response, taken with the agreement of the meeting, is that a specific action plan will put in place for each such country before the end of April.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the point where we would like it to be unless decisiveness and some element of fiscal control is shown.  There are countries where between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion which has been allocated by the taxpayers of Europe have not yet been drawn down because they have not produced projects on which this money could be spent.  Yesterday&rsquo;s Council meeting considered how elements of this structural funding could be used for training and development, in particular for young people.  Clearly, unemployment is a problem not only in Ireland, but in every country in the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the issue will be a central feature of every Council agenda from now on.  It is not the case that we have a treaty on austerity.  This is a political agreement that countries and their governments will run their affairs properly and will have a programme to see that they achieve proper financial control of their affairs and get their houses in order.  Every economy in the Union can grow as a consequence.  Ireland is in that position.  We are in a programme until the end of 2013.  Last week, we had a strong signal from the National Treasury Management Agency that confidence is growing, although we have a very long way to go.  Perhaps if Deputy Higgins turned his thoughts sometime to constructive suggestions instead of the kind of nonsense he goes on with, we might be far better off.</P>

        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I stated in previous replies, most recently in November 2011, my Government very much values dialogue with key representatives of civil society.  The Government recognises the contribution that social dialogue can make to maximising common understanding across all sectors of society as we respond to the many challenges facing the country.</P>
        <Col N="232" />
        <P>In October, the T&aacute;naiste and I stated our intention to meet with lead organisations over the following weeks and months.  In this regard the T&aacute;naiste and I met with ICTU on 2 November last, with the IFA on 14 November and with IBEC on 24 November.  Separately, I addressed the ICMSA annual general meeting on 19 November and I addressed the IFA annual general meeting on Wednesday, 18 January.</P>
        <P>The meetings in November were an opportunity to discuss broad economic issues and the challenges facing our country.  The T&aacute;naiste and I highlighted our support for ongoing bilateral engagement with relevant Ministers on issues of mutual concern, as well as the value of the National Economic and Social Council as a forum for engagement with Government on economic, social and environmental issues.  The council is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and has met five times since September last.  The T&aacute;naiste and I plan to attend a plenary session of the council each year.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to social dialogue does not amount to a return to rigid social partnership structures of the past but rather involves a more flexible, adaptable approach which can support change.  My intention is that senior Ministers, including the T&aacute;naiste and I, will continue to meet with social partner organisations on a periodic basis to discuss matters of mutual concern.</P>

        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>In terms of his engagement with the social partners, has the Taoiseach discussed any steps to avoid the recent events involving workers, such as those in Vita Cortex, La Senza and Lagan Brick, where they have had to go to extraordinary lengths to vindicate their rights and entitlements?  At stroke of pen, 250 workers in Diageo in Dundalk and Kilkenny were told they were out of work.  Unfortunately, that announcement came when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was in Guinness with the Diageo management.</P>
        <P>The occupation of Vita Cortex continues and it is in its seventh week despite the collapse of talks, which was no fault of the workers.  Clearly, the owner of that company has a responsibility to pay the workers what they are owed.  Has there been any feedback from the Labour Relations Commission and from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on this issue?  What will the Government do to ensure these workers&rsquo; rights are protected?  Will it introduce legislation to ensure no employer can in future treat workers in this disrespectful and exploitative fashion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">Some 32 Vita Cortex workers have been involved in a sit-in in Cork since 16 December, which arose from a dispute with their employer over redundancy payments, as Deputy Adams pointed out.  The workers seek severance payments of 2.9 weeks pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, in line with previous redundancy deals in that company.</P>
        <P>In the interest of achieving a resolution to the dispute, which is obviously of concern to everybody, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, urged both parties to avail of the industrial relations mechanisms available in this State as soon as possible with a view to the possibility of bringing a conclusion to it.  Officials from the Minister&rsquo;s Department were in contact with the workers&rsquo; union representatives in an attempt to clarify the issues involved and to make them aware that the industrial relations mechanism of the State was available to them so that they might be assisted to resolve that dispute.</P>
        <Col N="233" />
        <P>As Deputy Adams is aware, the Labour Relations Commission invited both parties to meet in Cork on Tuesday, 17 January to clarify the facts of the situation and, against that background, to explore with both parties the potential to move it forward.  The meeting adjourned and reconvened on Friday, 20 January.  Those talks adjourned on 20 January and there was no plan to reconvene.  According to the Labour Relations Commission, it was unable to find a basis for agreement between the two parties involved.  The Labour Relations Commission has confirmed that it will maintain contact with both parties and that if an opportunity should arise for it to be of any further assistance in this serious matter and in moving the situation forward, it will be prepared to get involved again.</P>
        <P>The absence of an agreement on the payment of extra statutory severance payments for the workers is without prejudice to the arrangements being made by the Department of Social Protection to process the applications made for payment of statutory redundancies to the workers concerned.  I can inform Deputy Adams and the House that I understand the Vita Cortex workers submitted 34 applications online on 22 December 2011.  Hard copies and associated correspondence and papers were received on 4 January of this year.</P>
        <P>Statutory straightforward redundancy claims submitted since October 2011 have generally been processed for payment within six to eight weeks.  This can vary considerably depending on the complexity of the claims but on the basis of the current processing times, I would expect that the Vita Cortex claims will be processed by 6 February.</P>
        <P>The position is that the Labour Relations Commission has made it clear to both sides that if it can be of any further assistance in resolving this dispute, it is there to assist if it can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that information.  My questions were around trying to ensure these events do not become common place and what he has done in regard to the social partners or to bring in legislation.  Diageo, which is a hugely profitable company, makes billions in profits and sells Harp and Guinness globally as Irish brands, closes a brewery in Dundalk with the stroke of a pen.  Some workers had given 25 years to 30 years of service.  It is not fair.  As I said earlier, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was actually in the Guinness headquarters at St. James&rsquo;s Gate when this announcement was made and there was not a bleat from the Government about it.  Some 250 workers, their families and all the small business which thrive in the local economy will be robbed of that income.</P>
        <P>To go back to my initial question, workers must be treated respectfully and not in an exploitative way.  Has the Government discussed this with the social partners?  Will it bring in legislation if there is a need to do so to ensure no employer can treat workers like this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>As I said, I intend to continue to meet the social partners as appropriate and I made that clear to them.  Together with the T&aacute;naiste, I hope to have full twice yearly meetings with them.  Clearly, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is concerned about these matters.  I repeat that the well proven mechanisms of the State are available where unfortunately disputes arise, as they do on a pretty regular basis.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to have a return to the kind of formal process that applied before but I have encouraged every Minister to engage bilaterally with the parties which might be relevant to their responsibilities.  The question of legislation beyond where we are does not arise at this time.</P>
        <P>The machinery has been tried and tested over many years and I would hope that, in the case of Vita Cortex and any other dispute, that process would be used and tested in order to see if a resolution can be brought about to what are sensitive and serious disputes affecting people and their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="234" />
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach does not seem to realise that what he calls the well proven mechanisms of the State are utterly ineffective in protecting workers&rsquo; rights with regard to some of these &mdash; what I was going to call &mdash; rogue employers.  However, the La Senza lingerie chain was part of a huge multinational corporation that owns Weetabix, which is an internationally known brand.  The Taoiseach says these protections are there, but how can it happen in this State that as workers go home on a Monday night, having left their shops, a few of them get telephone calls from KPMG, acting on the instructions of Lion Capital or La Senza, to tell them not to come in in the morning because their jobs were finished?  Does the Taoiseach realise that those workers are left hanging on for the State to pay their entitlements with regard to redundancies for 12 or 18 months by this massive multinational?  It has overall responsibility but it has created a spurious distinction between companies using legalisms so it can walk away.  It is incredible that this can happen in this day and age.</P>
        <P>The situation is similar for the Vita Cortex workers where the State mechanisms have let workers down.  The Government says it is concerned about the rights of these workers, so what initiative will it take regarding Vita Cortex and La Senza for an immediate redress of their situation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I am well aware of the nature of disputes and how sensitive and serious they can become.  Far from using the clich&eacute; of &ldquo;well tried mechanisms&rdquo;, the Labour Relations Commission has been an outstanding success over the years.  On occasion, it has spent many hours of intensive discussion trying to sort out disputes between employees and employers.  A better way has not been found &mdash; except probably in some dictatorships, which we are not &mdash; to resolve disputes.  I feel strongly that in regard to the particular dispute mentioned by Deputy Adams and others, a resolution has to be found.  The way forward is to explore all the possibilities that exist under the Labour Relations Commission, which is the official machinery of the State.  The officials of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, are available at any time to assist in that overall work.  I would like to see a resolution to these disputes, but the best process is to get involved with the Labour Relations Commission, which has a proven record of bringing parties together where sensitive disputes like this have occurred.  While talks were suspended in the Vita Cortex case, I hope they can be resumed and a way forward found.  At the end of the day, a resolution for that dispute has to be found in any event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I tabled a question on the social dialogue over the Croke Park agreement, which for some reason was transferred to the Minister with responsibility for the public sector, such is the restrictive nature of trying to get questions answered by the Taoiseach during Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions.  Would the Taoiseach agree it is arguable that if we had a more proactive social dialogue and social framework, the issues around Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick and other companies could have been dealt with much earlier?  The Labour Relations Commission came too late to the Vita Cortex dispute.  Ministers were standing back from it up to Christmas.  We ended up ringing Ministers about it on 23 December.  In addition, the matter was raised in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions prior to the Christmas recess, but no formal intervention came before January.  If a more proactive social dialogue was going on, a framework would exist to deal with these issues much earlier.  Closer linkages are required between employers, trade unions and State agencies in this regard.  It would also allow for more inter-ministerial dialogue.  Three Ministers are involved with different dimensions: Finance, Social Protection, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The resolution of this dispute could involve all three, as well as the owner who has the fundamental obligation and responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hear what the Taoiseach is saying about not wanting to go back, but there is an argument for a more proactive social dialogue.  The agency workers Bill was poorly worked out because <Col N="235" />of the absence of a proactive social dialogue between the partners.  We did not get the optimal outcome on that prior to Christmas as regards jobs in the economy.  It has passed most people by in terms of awareness and profile, but it could have implications for jobs if there was a more proactive engagement.</P>
        <P>It has been widely reported that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s backbenchers have been beating down his door about the Croke Park agreement, and that they and some Ministers have been talking tough about tearing up that agreement.  Is the Taoiseach holding any such discussions with backbenchers or are these stories just part of some misleading spin being placed in the media?  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm the Government&rsquo;s position on the Croke Park agreement because many Deputies in his own party and some in the Labour Party have questioned it; they have suggested that it be torn up.  I would argue that we do need a more proactive social dialogue framework to deal with many such issues that are arising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy has raised an important point about contact between the social partners and the Government.  While I said that I have no intention of returning to the formal process that existed before, in the meetings we have had with the social partners we have made it perfectly clear that the line is always open, either on an individual ministerial basis or directly to the Government.  I have made it clear to the social partners, as has the T&aacute;naiste, that if there is an issue that needs immediate attention or requires the availability of the Government, that line is open.  While I, as head of Government, and the T&aacute;naiste meet with the social partners in formal session twice a year, each individual Minister and member of the Government is available to the social partnership.  That is why in this case, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, outlined what the process was for dealing with this particular dispute in Cork, which has now dragged on for some time.  He appointed his own departmental officials to discuss with the workers&rsquo; union representatives the clarification of a number of issues there.  Following that, the Labour Relations Commission invited both parties to a meeting on 17 January, which resumed on 20 January and was then suspended.  I would hope that this process can be resumed because this dispute needs to be sorted out.  The people concerned need to have it resolved.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform set out for the House the position concerning the Croke Park agreement.  Deputy Martin is aware that a review of the agreement is pending in March this year.  We have already made a number of claims in regard to Croke Park being implemented in full.  We need this because it is an important element of the relations that exist between the public sector and the Government.  It is also an element that is clearly referred to in the memorandum of understanding with the troika.  All the issues in respect of the Croke Park agreement are due for review at the end of spring.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>In the second week of January, I was called by a La Senza worker and asked to come out to the occupation they had just begun because their jobs had been terminated and their wages had not been paid.  Yesterday, I received another telephone call from a La Senza worker who said their promised wages from KPMG had still not been paid.  In addition, they will be subject to emergency tax because KPMG has messed up their tax credit entitlements, which means they will not get much of their money for a considerable time.  They have also had massive delays in accessing the social welfare system because they did not get their P45 forms until yesterday morning, after two weeks of haranguing KPMG on that issue.  Since June, the Jane Norman workers have been without a month&rsquo;s wages due to them when the company went into administration.  Jane Norman is now trading in this country with a new workforce that is paid less and on lower conditions.  The Connolly shoe workers in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have been on strike for over a year after their employment was terminated.  Despite several Labour Court rulings in their favour, the employer has not yet paid the moneys <Col N="236" />owed.  These issues raise the question of what this Government will do to stop rogue employers treating workers like this.  It needs legislative action so that employers cannot do this to workers.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene on the specifics of the cases I mentioned and to bring forward legislation to protect workers.  If we can do it to protect bankers, can we do it to protect workers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised three cases, the workers being subject to emergency tax because KPMG did not send out wages, the Jane Norman workers who have not been paid, and the workers in the shoe shop who have not been paid.  I do not have all the details of these cases.  Workers have rights and it is important that these rights are exercised and fulfilled in accordance with the law.  Where a dispute arises, there must be a dispute mechanism to clarify the issues and get on with the resolution of the dispute.  I do not have the detail of the reasons why KPMG has not been able to pay wages and whether the Revenue Commissioners said the workers will be subject to emergency tax because they have not received their wages in time.  In respect of Jane Norman and the Connolly shoe workers, if Deputy Boyd Barrett forwards the details of the cases, I will be able to offer some assistance in having the matter resolved.  There may be other elements to these disputes of which I am not aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">Following my colleague&rsquo;s question, immediately after questions to the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach should get one of his senior officials to telephone KPMG and ask the company to send the wages immediately.  The workers are in very difficult economic circumstances.  This is money that they are owed.  There is cynicism in working them overtime during sales and then walking away without notice.  I will telephone KPMG, along with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, and I ask the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to telephone KPMG.  I will forward the name of the relevant official in KPMG to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office so that he can be told the money should be out within days.  Is that not simple justice?  Should the State not stand behind workers who are victimised in this disgusting fashion by companies behaving in this manner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Workers are entitled to receive their legitimate wages and if Deputies Higgins and Boyd Barrett give me the details of these cases after the Order of Business, I will be happy to contact the firm involved.  People expect to have their wages paid and I do not have the detail of what is blocking this.</P>

        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs has met five times since it was established. The most recent meeting was on 19 January 2012.  I chaired all these meetings <Col N="237" />except one, on 21 July, which I could not attend due to a special European Council meeting in Brussels.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on economic infrastructure has met five times, the last being on 10 November 2011.  No date has been set for the next meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>My questions concern the sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs and the number of times it has met, and the Cabinet sub-committee on economic infrastructure.  One of the Government&rsquo;s defining characteristics is its capacity to make claims that fly in the face of reality.  The Government praised the budget for being fair and protecting front-line services whereas we know it did the opposite, as it was unfair and hit front-line services dramatically, as we know from tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; business motion concerning small rural schools.</P>
        <P>The same point is applicable to the jobs agenda.  Last year, we had the downgraded jobs initiative, which cost jobs, undermined private pensions and took money from pensioners.  Where will the much-heralded growth in jobs come from?  Can the Taoiseach tell us if the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs will oversee the new jobs strategy, which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has been briefing the media about?  Is there a concrete time limit on its work?</P>
        <P>I will ask a separate question on economic infrastructure, referring to Question No. 8, after the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to this question on the Cabinet sub-committee economic recovery.  The Taoiseach has grouped all the questions together.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>This morning, 800 jobs were announced in Dublin.  A fortnight ago, there was an investment of &euro;350 million by a multinational in the pharmaceutical sector.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will bring proposals for a jobs action plan to Government within the next two weeks.  The Minister for Social Protection will bring in a range of measures to ensure we have a real focus on opportunities for people on the live register to make their contribution, which they want to do, in schemes that provide part-time work, hopefully leading to full-time work, or opportunities to retrain and upskill.  The central focus of Government must be on job creation and job initiatives.  I do not share the view of Deputy Martin about the VAT reduction in the hospitality sector or the PRSI reduction for lower paid workers.  Growth in tourism was 7% last year and, given that we have most of the infrastructure in place, one of the flagship projects for this country for the years ahead is to get people to come here and to give them a quality experience at competitive prices.</P>
        <P>The announcements by, and focus of, the Government will be the creation of jobs.  The budgetary announcements this year led to credit facilities being made available to those who market goods abroad for sale from Ireland to the BRIC countries.  There were tax concessions in respect of research and development for SMEs.  The budget included mortgage interest relief for those who purchase houses in 2012 and there is a 10% cushion if they make the purchase in 2012 and prices fall further.  No capital gains will apply to commercial property if purchased in 2012 and held for seven years.  These are a direct impetus to the market, which will hopefully have a response in stimulating the construction sector from a very low base.  That sector is critical in the growth of any economy.  Within the next two weeks, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will bring his plan for jobs to Government and, in parallel, the Minister for Social Protection will bring forward her proposals.</P>
        <P>The pipeline of investment in the country is quite strong.  I have met a number of chief executives in the recent past who are considering investment in Ireland.  I cannot say what their decision will be but international confidence in Ireland has risen greatly.  It is a statement of confidence that people are making announcements of the significance of today&rsquo;s announcement <Col N="238" />of 800 jobs.  This happens at a time when people seem to think we in this country wallow in troughs of depression and despair.  We have difficulties and challenges but the ship is pointed in the right direction and our plan is to fulfil the programme for Government and create a situation where jobs can be created at home and where our young people do not have to leave.</P>

The industrial strategy of the past number of years and of the previous Government has borne fruit and has been solid in terms of its focus on research and development, corporation tax, the lowering of inward investment and so forth.  The pipeline is strong because of a number of fundamental things that have been put in place over the years, in terms of foreign investment and the innovative creative side in the domestic economy which we have to pursue.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Is it in charge of the overall strategy?  I got a wandering reply which stated various Ministers are doing different things.  Is the sub-committee overseeing the jobs strategy that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has been briefing people about?  The fact it has only met five times in 12 months does not inspire confidence about the most fundamental issue facing the country, namely jobs.  That probably speaks volumes about the lack of a coherent response to date on the jobs question.</P>
        <P>In regard to the question on infrastructure, the review on capital expenditure from the Minister, Deputy Howlin, last December praised the infrastructural investment of the last decade and said infrastructure is core to the Government&rsquo;s plan.  He was generous enough to pay tribute to the work that was undertaken during the last decade.  Can the Taoiseach tell us if the terms of reference of the sub-committee include reviewing the level of capital spending?  Will it be able to review new figures which show that the budget reduced capital spending at the lowest level in Europe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>We discussed the economic management council, which I chair.  In respect of the sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs, nine different sectors are involved and working groups have been involved at an intensive level for the past number of months.  That will be reflected in the programme which the Minister will bring before Government in the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee is the oversight group which will ensure value for money is achieved in respect of what is being spent.  I understand and share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that decisions on multinational investment here do not take place overnight.  I have been the first to recognise the value of the intercity routes we have and how they have transformed travel <Col N="239" />within the country, as well as the possibilities for transport and commerce as a consequence.  We have a great deal more to do.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s &euro;17 billion capital programme for the duration of this plan sets out what we hope to achieve in terms of infrastructure and also looks at the possibilities that exist beyond the plan for further investment from other sources and infrastructural projects in Ireland.  We could all line out opportunities for investment which would create jobs and have an impact on commerce and economic development.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of the sub-committee having to meet every month.  The fact it meets and assigns work to different sectors and sectoral groups will culminate in the proposal and programme being brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the next two weeks.  It will take into account the schemes and opportunities to get effective results from the spend of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We would like to think that the focus of Government on jobs and job creation will bring tangible benefits to people all over the country as a consequence.  No more than having investment in the multinational pipeline, that does not happen overnight.</P>
        <P>Several thousand people are now involved in JobBridge, which mostly involve the private sector, and Tuas schemes.  I find the results coming from employers are very strong and positive.  A great number of qualified young people are being offered permanent jobs or intend to start their own businesses as a consequence of their experience.  It is not a case of having the end result now, rather it is a case of serious thought about serious proposals to bring about serious results that will benefit everybody.</P>

        <P>There is a calculated propaganda campaign here and in Europe to talk up prospects, and say that the worst is over, things have changed and we are now at the beginning of significant growth.  Does the Taoiseach not agree it is all propaganda?  The reality of the hard cold figures tell a different story.  It is no coincidence that the EU summit discussed job creation; it wants to sell an austerity treaty so it dresses it up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>What new ideas, proposals and funding, if any, will the Taoiseach be bringing news of to the economic recovery and jobs sub-committee after his attendance at the summit?  He mentioned job creation, small enterprise support etc., were important items on the agenda.  What is the outcome?  What are the targets?  Does the State have specific targets with regard to job creation?</P>
        <P>We hope every one of the 800 workers employed over the next two years in a new enterprise will have solid, well-paid jobs with decent conditions.  We have to remember that TalkTalk, which walked not long ago, got rid of 575 workers.  As I said, every job is valuable.  The problem with capital intensive multinational investment directed towards exports is that it yields very few jobs.  Does the Taoiseach not see a contradiction in regard to the domestic economy, which is the critical area where jobs will be created and saved?  There is a fundamental contradiction between the Taoiseach talking up jobs here and the fact that 0.5% growth has been predicted for next year.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what prospects came from the EU summit?</P>

        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Maybe the Deputy should also speak to those involved in the hospitality and tourism sector in his constituency and make them aware of the reduction in PRSI for lower paid workers and VAT which has had an impact on the strength of local economies.  He should at least talk some reality about where opportunities actually lie.</P>
        <P>As I said, over 4,000 people have now taken up the opportunity of training and internship schemes to assist jobseekers to get them on the path towards the opportunity of a permanent job, which would be in their interests.</P>
        <P>The labour activation fund, which will be introduced shortly by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, will focus on those who have been on the live register for 12 months or more.  The Government will legislate for partial loan credit guarantees in respect of companies &mdash; small and medium-sized enterprises &mdash; that are not in a position to draw money from financial institutions.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 companies, at least, will be able to avail of the scheme this year.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, is dealing with the micro-finance agency along with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in respect of smaller operators that might be employing two, five or seven people commercially on the basis of the first-step principle.  We must, however, look beyond focusing on trying to resurrect our economy with very small schemes.  We must consider the future, the shape of which is changing before our eyes.  I refer to cloud computing, digital gaming, financial services and the agri-food industry.</P>
        <P>If when travelling to his native county Deputy Higgins stops anywhere on the way to talk to the young farmers and producers, he will note that the agri-food sector has exported produce this year worth over &euro;9 billion.  In fairness to the previous Government, its food harvest programme is a fine document, and it is being followed intensely.  We hope the export figure of the agri-food sector will reach over &euro;12 billion in the coming years.  It is on these areas that we must focus because this is where the future lies.</P>
        <P>Despite the normal litany of despair, the fact that exports increased by 4% in the first ten months of 2011 speaks for itself.  There has been a monthly increase of 16% in the trade surplus and a return to growth in 2011 for the first time since 2007.  There are signs that inspire confidence.  They are not the be-all and end-all but we are heading in the right action.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Government focusing on job creation and job creation schemes, I agree with the Deputy that a job can transform a life.  Young working people I meet appreciate having a job and feel challenged by the contribution they can make.</P>
        <P>I regret more cannot be done in the short term but the priorities of the Government will be job creation, incentivising job creation and activation measures for those on the live register to get them off the conveyor belt and into work where they will want to make a contribution.  I hope we can give them the opportunity to have careers in which they will feel fulfilled and that they can play their part as good citizens.</P>
        <P>In the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency, far from telling people the world is going to end, one could tell them that, just over the hill, there is a new opportunity, but that to get there we must all work very hard, including the Deputy.</P>

        <P>Has the job stimulus package been discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs?  It is the only way we will get people out of this crisis.  Almost half a million people are on the dole.  I believe we have the highest rate of youth unemployment.</P>

I cannot get away from the fact that the Taoiseach signed up last night to making cuts or tax increases amounting to another &euro;6 billion, yet there is not one red cent for jobs.  T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in an-soil&eacute;ir faoi seo.  T&aacute;imid i bhf&aacute;bhar infheisti&uacute; agus spreagadh poist i r&eacute;ims&iacute;&eacute;ags&uacute;la le tamall fada.  C&eacute;n plean at&aacute; ag an Rialtas anois?  D&uacute;irt an Taoiseach bomaite &oacute; shin go raibh plean aige.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go raibh s&eacute; ag smaoineamh ar an five-point plan.   It was not a cunning plan but one to become Taoiseach.  It was not a plan to bring the State to where it needs to be.  Do we have a plan and is it being discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Deputy Adams left out two important words in the litany of characteristics he mentioned: &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; and &ldquo;imagination&rdquo;.  These are inherent to Irish success.   In this regard, I refer to cloud computing, data content storage, digital gaming and the agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>I am sure that the Deputy is well aware of the extent of innovation and research in his constituency.  He will be aware that young Irish engineers and entrepreneurs are in a position to, and do, lead the world in the number of cases.  The response of the Government will be to open doors where it can.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has responsibility for small businesses, releasing the blockage in the system, removing the red tape and ensuring the creation of an environment in <Col N="242" />which jobs can be created by business and in which private enterprise can flourish.  Small impacts are very important because economies are built with small businesses.  Over 90% of the businesses in the European Union are small businesses.  As I said to Deputy Martin, there are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the Union and 23 million unemployed.  If, in theory, one could equate one with the other, one would wipe out the unemployment problem.  Just as the bigger firms from abroad that invest here have grown enormously in financial importance, small businesses and micro-businesses in any locality are critical to the economic lifeblood.  We need a combination of business types.  Small businesses must be able to produce for local needs, small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to service the needs of big plants from a specialist perspective and Irish businesses must be able to export abroad and continue to avail of the potential in the Single Market.</P>
        <P>If somebody in County Louth wishes to patent a product that is the result of research and innovation, he faces a blockage in that it costs approximately &euro;32,000 to have it recognised throughout Europe.  The Single Market, to which we signed up, should mean recognition in Ireland should apply across the Union.  The kinds of costs incurred in the Union are not incurred in respect of patent innovations in the United States and other places.  We want to have everybody at a point where he or she can set up a business within three days for a very nominal amount.  I want to see the recommendations of the reports by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, put into effect in every constituency such that businesses can take off and begin to create jobs.  That is the focus of our attention.</P>
        <P>At the same time, one needs to keep in perspective what will occur in the future, be it associated with robotics, genetics, the Internet, nanotechnology or nanomedicine.  We must focus on these important trends because the world is changing before our very eyes and the young people about whom we all speak need to be given platforms from which they can lead the country when their time comes.  That means we have to run our public finances properly to provide opportunities for businesses to commence and be creative so they can have that opportunity to do their business in the times ahead.  There is a whole spectrum in which we are interested, and that applies in every corner of the land.  For example, the connectivity which Deputy Martin is aware is coming across the Atlantic would, from a digital perspective, literally light up Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to potentially become a global leader for data content storage and for cloud computing, which is one of the big waves where jobs will be created in the next decade.  It is in there we need to be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>Is not all the talk of jobs coming out of the sub-committee or the EU Summit yesterday a bit preposterous when at the same time the key element of policy is to continue suffocating the economy with the debt of zombie banks and imposing crippling austerity?  Is it not a little bit like saying we have a magical formula to cure a sick man while we are holding a pillow over his face and draining him of his blood?  Is this not the reality of all the talk about jobs, namely, that it directly conflicts with the main thrust of policy coming from the EU authorities, which is being implemented by the Government?  It simply cannot create jobs, at least at a faster rate than it is losing them, if it is imposing austerity and all the funds that should go into investment are going into zombie banks.</P>
        <P>I was in Berlin on Thursday with the finance committee of the German Bundestag.  I asked them this question: how do they seriously propose to deal with the collapse of investment in Europe, given the austerity?  They said the main point was to increase competitiveness so we would get investment from China and India.  If that is the strategy, we are really banjaxed because, of course, the problem is there can be no serious investment, and there is very little investment coming from China and India, because they can see that the European economy is <Col N="243" />contracting under the weight of the austerity.  Although this is precisely the market that would buoy up possible investment, it is contracting.</P>
        <P>This is even the case with the German economy, which is the other piece of news people need to know.  The German economy itself is contracting and has no money.  The only reason we are even debating with the Germans about borrowing and bonds is that they can borrow money cheaper, but they do not actually have any money.  Their economy is contracting too, just like our economy and the whole European economy, because it is being suffocated by the banking debt burden and by austerity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">

        <P>&mdash;&mdash;they had relented and lain down in front of the juggernaut of B-B from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to wipe out Ireland&rsquo;s debt.  We live in the world of reality and it is a fraud on the Irish people to pretend we did not inherit a situation which requires serious analysis.  That is why, within the process in which we operate, the troika, the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank themselves said they will now produce a paper on opportunities for Ireland given the very onerous, unique burden our citizens have to face because of the extent of moneys borrowed for recapitalisation of the banks before the facilities of the EFSF and ESM came into being.</P>
        <P>Deputy Boyd Barrett probably did not use the opportunity to say to the German Bundestag committee that his wages are paid by them as well.  I certainly did not hear Reuters, Bloomberg or anybody else say that, because of the intervention and articulation of Deputy Boyd Barrett, Germany relented and that Ireland&rsquo;s debt could be wiped out in the morning.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>As a supplementary to the questions I tabled on these important Cabinet sub-committees, first, I want to acknowledge the Taoiseach&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the role of the last Government in terms of Food Harvest 2020 and creating a blueprint which has had the buy-in of all the stakeholders concerned with the development of the agriculture and food industry, which is an important platform for the growth of that sector and the creation of jobs.  I also welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s acknowledgement of industrial strategy over recent years, which has essentially been about building up jobs based on making our own goods and services, and selling them abroad to create wealth.  That is important and has been acknowledged, and I wish to acknowledge the acknowledgement.</P>
        <P>The key point is that the domestic economy is flat.  I put it to the Taoiseach that for the committee to meet only five times reflects a lack of urgency about the jobs issue generally within the system.  To take the Government&rsquo;s capital programme, the problem with the budget and the Government&rsquo;s approach is that it has been watching the votes too much and everything has been electorally proofed to too great an extent.</P>

        <P>The jobs initiative was more electoral manipulation &mdash; it was an election gimmick.  The problem was it was not a gimmick for the pensioners out there who have had their pensions raided.  For what?  It was for nothing in terms of job creation because very little of that money was spent on job creation in the past 12 months, and we have those figures from the Minister for Finance.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I am not saying anybody here has all the answers but we need a bit of urgency, sincerity and commitment.  For what it is worth, the system to date is not energised enough in terms of youth unemployment.  Much more can be done.  To have a committee on jobs and economic recovery meet just five times in 12 months reflects that inertia and that lack of urgency and attention this issue demands from the system and from Government and its agencies.  That is the point I am making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>I put down the question to try to establish the type of work the Cabinet sub-committee is doing in terms of its remit of economic recovery and jobs.  I cannot come away from the fact the Taoiseach plans to cut &euro;8.6 billion from the economy in the next three years to meet the troika deficit target, plans to pay bad banks &euro;3.1 billion on 31 March and yesterday agreed to a target that will mean a further &euro;6 billion in cuts and taxes.  This is the problem that has to be grappled with.  Unless the Government can put money into job stimulus and unless this committee is dealing with that issue, there is a problem.  The Taoiseach said in response to my earlier question that it is dealing with that issue, so I look forward to seeing its detailed proposals.</P>
        <P>My question is simply to re-put the question I asked earlier.  If the 250 Diageo workers are not getting their proper terms and conditions, will the Taoiseach intervene with the management to ensure they get them?  I refer to the people who were paid off in Kilkenny and Dundalk after a lifetime of service to what, I reiterate, is a thriving and profitable industry that sells itself globally as Brand Ireland,  being Harp and Guinness.  Will the Taoiseach intervene?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">
        <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I reiterate, the opportunity is always there for social partners to make contact directly with individual Ministers even though we are not returning to the former process.  No more than with Vita Cortex, if there is an issue with any other company, not only is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, interested in the resolution of all such disputes but he makes his departmental officials available to trade union workers&rsquo; representatives in order to clarify any issues that might be involved.  The Labour Relations Commission is the vehicle by which both parties can be brought together to bring about a resolution to these problems.</P>
        <P>In order that the Deputy will clearly understand it, I reiterate that what was agreed in Brussels yesterday does not impact in any way upon the fact that this country is in a programme to the end of 2013.  The decision yesterday reiterates the political guarantee that a country in a programme will continue to be funded beyond that programme if so required, provided it measures up to the conditions it must meet.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case those conditions are challenging.  One of the problems we face is that we are required to pay &euro;3 billion per year over the next ten years for the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny">

        <P>For that reason, in the intensive discussions it has had with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the troika stated it would produce a technical paper on this issue which is of such importance to the deficit and to our capacity to repay our debts.  I look forward with great interest to that paper being produced because the potential benefit is significant.  However, it would require the support of the 27 member states.</P>
        <P>I reverse the Deputy&rsquo;s argument and that of Deputy Martin by stating that the spend in the next number of years is &euro;17 billion in a capital programme which includes 40 new schools, 180 serious refurbishments and a creative way, as outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to deal through the national lottery with the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will be of such importance over the coming 50 years.  It also deals with the European Investment Bank provisions for major infrastructure, in particular the roads programme, including Newlands Cross and the N11.  The Deputy can take it the Government is seriously interested, having discussed with the social partners the possibility of pension funds and other investment opportunities being brought in from outside the programme for Government in respect of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I point out to Deputy Martin that I do not wish to get involved in the process.  The Cabinet sub-committee oversees this and allocates work to the different sectors which report back to the Cabinet.  It is not by the number of meetings one can judge the value of this but by the work that is produced, where value for money and real effect can be had for the taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>We could have decided at the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure to look at some major projects, for example, metro north and a number of others that have been put into suspension.  One could spend hundreds of millions of euro in planning and consultancies without creating any jobs on the ground.</P>

        <P>We would like to think that by the end of the first year all these problems could be sorted out but that is not possible.  The focus is very clear in this regard.  The movement is in the right direction and as it begins to pick up and focus on stimulating the indigenous economy one hopes we can bring about a lifting of confidence, a spend in people&rsquo; resources and more jobs being created therefrom, bringing about a greater confidence among our people.  That is where my focus and that of the Government lies.</P>

It is proposed that notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the proceedings of No. 12 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 50 minutes, opening statements shall be made by a Minister or Minister of State followed by the main spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who shall be called on in that order and who may share their time, not exceeding five minutes in each case; a Minister or Minister of State shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes; and the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not agreed.  I will explain the reason.  The Taoiseach is well aware of the importance of global Internet companies to our economy and the vital importance of making clear to the world that Ireland, as a country, is committed to innovation and creativity in this sector.</P>
      <P>We need a deeper and fundamental reflection on this question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, is handling the issue of on-line copyright, although perhaps not perfectly at this stage.  So far the handling of it is giving rise, correctly or otherwise, to a damaging perception of how this country views Internet freedom.  I accept and acknowledge this is an evolving situation and there are very strong views on all sides of the debate.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider postponing implementation of the statutory instrument and allow more time for discussion, or for a mechanism within the House to have a more detailed and fundamental reflection on how we deal with this fundamental issue in the modern era?  It requires further deliberation by all in the House.</P>

      <P>This is being handled in a serious manner by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  Last week I stated to the House that in the EMI and Others <i>v.</i> UPC High Court judgment of 11 October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton pointed out he was restrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and thus could not grant an injunction to prevent infringement of copyright against an information service provider, or ISP, in the circumstances of what are called transient communications.  In so doing, he stated Ireland had not fully transposed the relevant EU directives.</P>
      <P>Legal proceedings against the State have been issued by the plaintiffs in the UPC case.  Damages arising from a successful challenge here could be quite substantial.</P>
      <P>On 22 December 2011, the European Commission also requested information on Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the copyright directive.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is handling this in a serious manner.  The audits carried out already indicate this matter needs to be attended to and that is what the Minister of State is doing.</P>

Will he consider the establishment of a sub-committee of the European affairs committee to facilitate broader discussion in the House and to tease out the treaty&rsquo;s implications for future budgets and job creation?  Will this sub-committee also consider in depth the impact assessments the Government must have undertaken and prepared in advance of the negotiations leading to the treaty?  Before Christmas, I asked the Taoiseach to establish such a committee, as had been done for the Lisbon treaty and which was effective in bringing Members into the discussion.

The committee is a full Oireachtas committee of the House.  It should have hearings on the intergovernmental agreement and the treaty to tease out the issues.  This treaty is not as expansive as the Lisbon treaty which covered a large spectrum of issues and circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is preparing the fiscal responsibility Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, this was a commitment given by the Government prior to the intergovernmental treaty agreed yesterday in Brussels in respect of legislating for a debt brake.</P>
      <P>I should point out to him, as I did to other Members of his party, that the country is in a programme and no decision taken yesterday will interfere with that programme.  We hope to be able to emerge from the programme by the end of 2013 and fly on our own rather than requiring to have recourse to further funding.  If further funding is required, a country emerging from a programme that is meeting its commitments will continue to receive funding.  Far from signing up to an austerity programme for the future, this is a political agreement whereby 25 of the 27 countries have signed up for fiscal responsibility, budgetary discipline, getting the public finances in order and focusing on growth and jobs as a central agenda for growing the economies of Europe and achieving the full potential of the Single Market.  The British <Col N="252" />Government, for its own reasons as explained by its Prime Minister prior to Christmas, did not wish to participate in this intergovernmental agreement and the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic indicated last night that he does not wish to sign for complex constitutional reasons.  That leaves 25 of the 27 member states focused on sorting out the economic affairs of Europe and having the potential to grow our economies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and I am pleased that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has come into the House to deal with it.  Thousands of home owners have been under a misapprehension about certain regulations for what is colloquially described as the second house charge, which was introduced in 2009.  I wish to highlight a consequent anomaly in which I ask the Minister to show an element of redress and common sense.  We were led to believe this charge was a tax on second houses, holiday homes and investment properties in the amount of &euro;200 per annum payable in 2009.  The tax applied to non-full time residences and became due on 1 September 2009.  I make the case that thousands of people have not adequately registered or paid because they have been under a misapprehension as to whether there was a liability.  Interest is running and penalties have been imposed resulting in bills of <Col N="255" />many thousands of euro having been amassed by people who had no idea they were subject to the tax.  The assumption was that anybody who had a principal private dwelling &mdash; being the home in which he or she ordinarily resided &mdash; would not be liable.</P>
        <P>In my constituency &mdash; I am sure this is true of other Deputies&rsquo; constituencies &mdash; many people bought their houses as first-time buyers.  They got their mortgages and moved in, but owing to economic necessity have left the jurisdiction of the State and emigrated to Australia, Canada or the UK because they could not find employment in this country.  In many cases the mortgage could not be paid and they entered into an arrangement to let the house.  They may have engaged somebody in caretaking the house &mdash; to mind the house for them in order to pay the mortgage until the economic climate improved to allow these people to return to friends and family in this country and resume residence within the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have in many respects adopted a high-handed approach by issuing letters informing people that they may or may not be liable when a strict reading of the legislation shows a certain liability.  I am asking that a waiver of interest and penalties be provided by the Minister to facilitate those people suffering because of the anomalous situation.  The Consumers Association of Ireland recently adverted to matter by stating that in Dublin alone there may be up to 7,000 such houses where people because of economic necessity had to leave the family home, many returning to live with their parents.  They made arrangements for a rental income to be paid on the house which they used to pay the mortgage to keep the banks from repossessing the houses.  I believe the local authorities should have notified the people as to the liability &mdash; if, indeed, there was a liability.  It is neither fair nor just to adopt a high-handed approach.</P>
        <P>I refer to media reports at the time the tax was imposed.  Headlines indicated that owners of second homes had two days to pay the charge and that residential investors must pay the money.  However, there was no reference to those who by economic necessity had to leave the jurisdiction of the State and I am now asking for certain clemency in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>I know Deputy Charles Flanagan will agree that I do not write headlines for newspapers and that is not the basis on which we collect money nor can it ever be.  It is the duty and responsibility of each homeowner to understand the law and be compliant with it.  I wish to set out for the Deputy the issues involved.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  The charge on non-principal private residences, since its introduction in 2009, has contributed some &euro;205 million to the financing of vital local authority services, including fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, planning and development services, public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure facilities, etc.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the existing revenue base of local authorities is narrow by international standards.  This was a consideration in the introduction of the non-principal private residences charge in 2009.  While the NPPR charge represents a dedicated source of funding for local authorities and is relatively stable, it does not go far enough in addressing the imbalance in the sector&rsquo;s financing.  A proper broadening of the revenue base for local government is being brought about as a result of the introduction of the household charge in 2012 and the potential of the subsequent property tax in due course.  This measure is significant because it recognises that local authorities should not be disproportionately dependent on central government funding.  The 2009 Act is structured from a starting position of a universal liability for the charge in respect of all residential property.  Liability arises each year on a point-in-time basis, which is <Col N="256" />31 March in each year.  A number of exemptions from the charge are provided for in the Act, the most significant being where a property is an owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence.  The charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property to assess whether there is a liability to pay the charge in the first instance.  The Act places the charge on non-principal private residences under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Perhaps that is an avenue the Deputy might wish to pursue his concerns on the matters he raised.</P>
        <P>Where a person owns a property in which he or she does not live and his or her sole or main residence is another property, there may be a liability for the non-principal private residence charge in respect of the property owned by the person, unless it is exempted under section 4 of the Act.  Interpretation of the legislation is ultimately a matter for legal advice.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to clarify that the charge on non-principal private residences is not a second-home charge as it has been termed.  The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, provides for a charge on residences which are not the owners&rsquo; sole or main residence.  However, I note the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on mounting arrears owing to genuine reasons on the part of some homeowners who might not have considered themselves liable.  I will investigate his concerns and seek a reasonable and practical solution with local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
        <P>I certainly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s concluding comments.  However, I take him up on a point he made in the course of his reply which was that I might take up the matter with local authorities.  Is he indicating therefore that different local authorities might adopt a different interpretation as to the imposition of penalties and surcharges or whether there may be a liability?  That confusion is the nub of the issue.  There does not appear to be a strict reading of the legislation across the board.  I refer to a recent statement on the part of a spokeswoman for the Local Government Management Agency, which as the Minister will be aware, administers the collection of the charge for local authorities.  She stated that the management agency does not know how many people, who own one property, are liable to the charge as it is enforced by individual local authorities and that there may well be a liability.  This is the confusion.  Either there is a liability or there is not; likewise, either there is flexibility or there is not.</P>
        <P>There is considerable hardship on citizens of this State who have been forced to emigrate to Canada and Australia.  In order to meet the mortgage repayments they were forced to enter into an agreement.  Perhaps some of them are lucky to get people to enter into a letting arrangement to pay the mortgage while these people had to fend for themselves and their families abroad.  I am asking for a common sense approach to apply to those who are not aware of it and who are now facing not only the charge but also considerable interest, surcharges and penalties, which have been accumulating since September 2009 and are imposing significant hardship and difficulty on individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
        <P>As the Deputy will know it is often very difficult to interpret who is genuine and who is not when it comes to complying with the law and the collection of money.  When arrears ultimately accumulate it is a regular excuse for people to claim they were not aware of their obligations under the law.  It is a difficult one and I understand the Deputy probably has genuine cases in mind and I am obviously taking his constituents as very sound and solid citizens in that regard.  However, the strict interpretation of and compliance with the law are matters in the first instance for the owner of the property and the people who are liable for the second or third home as the case may be.  I am certainly conscious that there may often be some misinterpretation or different interpretations by local authorities and I will clarify that for the Deputy in so far as I can, but the law is quite straightforward.  There is a <Col N="257" />liability in respect of the second home and a levy of &euro;200 is charged.  I have encountered cases in my constituency in which people believed they were genuinely not informed or aware of it even though it is their responsibility to be informed and aware of it.  Anyway, we will see what we can do to ensure compliance with the law and collection of the charge in a way that does not bring about greater financial hardship on the individual.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the issue and I thank the Minister of State for taking the question.  Despite the excellent growth and export figures for the food industry, there has been an alarming trend in recent years whereby several key food manufacturing centres have closed down.  This trend has serious consequences for food security.  We are an island nation but despite our access to European markets and strong transport links to Europe, the volcanic ash cloud incident and the ice and snow last winter showed us that it is not difficult to shut down these links for a period.</P>
        <P>On 19 January, it was announced that the Odlums industrial-sized flour mill on Alexandra Road would be closed by the parent company, Valeo Foods.  My sympathies go to the workers and their families.  Many of these families had worked for several generations in the flour milling industry.</P>
        <P>This is the last remaining industrial bread flour mill in the State since the Odlums Cork mill closed in 2009.  Bolands Mills and Dock Milling have closed as has the mill in Portlaoise and several other mills throughout the country.  We are left with a single mill.  The mill in Dublin Port has been in operation since 1920, producing 17,000 tonnes of flour annually.  From the end of March most bread in Ireland will be made from imported flour.  This is a serious issue for bread makers and consumers.  It reduces their choice and has a possible implication for pricing.  For many years the flour industry has suffered from dumping of over-produced flour, especially from the British market, making some of our flour mills uneconomical.  The costs may not become clear for years but we have seen in the case of Irish Sugar that losing these strategic industries results in a loss of skills that cannot be replaced easily.  A similar problem occurred in the case of SR Technics.  These skills have been developed over many decades and we are now facing the closure of the final remaining mill.  For a country that places such pride in its food, it is bizarre that we will now be reliant on flour from the United Kingdom for most of our bread which is a key part of almost every Irish person&rsquo;s diet.</P>

        <P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Humphreys, for raising this important issue for discussion.  I consider the maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector in Ireland to be of the utmost importance.  In addition to providing an income for growers, it provides the livestock sector with a key source of feeding stuffs.</P>
        <P>The EU cereal harvest for 2011 is estimated at 281 million tonnes, somewhat above the five year average, with a marginal reduction in stock levels.  World cereal stock levels are forecast to remain unchanged due to balanced global consumption and production.  World cereal prices peaked during 2011 but have fallen back in recent months due to increased market concerns about the global financial crisis.  In Ireland, the 2011 cereals harvest was one of the best harvests in years, estimated at 2.5 million tonnes, some 22% above the 2010 production levels and well above the long-term average of 2 million tonnes.  This record production was due to a combination of factors including an increased cereals area and favourable weather conditions during the growing and harvest seasons, although this did not apply to the people of Donegal who had a hard time of it.  National cereal yields in 2011 were the highest recorded for winter and spring barley, with yields of 9 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes per hectare respectively and second highest <Col N="258" />for winter and spring wheat with yields of 10.2 tonnes and 8.3 tonnes per hectare.  Production costs increased during the year but cereal prices remained strong, especially for those who opted for forward selling, with malting barley prices performing especially well.  As a result of outstanding yields and good prices, Teagasc estimates an increase of 10% in the acreage sown for winter cereals.</P>
        <P>The cereal sector is now entering a period of new market-led opportunities but these are set against significant challenges, including commodity prices trends, the security of food and energy supplies, environmental sustainability and climate change.  Against this background, the goals for the sector are to improve competitiveness, profitability and sustainability by increasing yields and to improve product quality while reducing production costs.  Achieving these goals will be underpinned by advances in science through knowledge generation and procurement, technological developments and innovation.  In this regard Teagasc is providing research, training and advisory services for the sector.</P>
        <P>Odlums has a long history in Ireland and has been milling and packing flour for more than 160 years.  The original business was established in Portlaoise by the Odlums family in 1845 and has been owned by Valeo Foods since September 2010.  The decision by Odlums to close the Dublin Port mill is commercial, taking account of the current challenging market conditions in the industrial bakery flour market.  According to Odlums, the mill has been loss-making and unable to compete with low-cost imports especially from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The company has stated that there is significant excess milling capacity in the United Kingdom which is imported into the Irish market at prices with which Odlums cannot compete.  The company continues to produce retail and &ldquo;at home&rdquo; baking products in its mill in Portarlington.  It points out that locally grown milling wheat remains the major source of wheat for all products produced at Portarlington.</P>
        <P>I regret the announcement by Odlums to close the Dublin Port mill and the loss of jobs.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that Odlums is a private enterprise and, accordingly, its decision to close the Dublin Port mill is a matter for commercial decision and neither I nor my Government colleagues have any function in that regard.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer and that there has been low-cost dumping in Ireland and that this has greatly undermined flour milling in the country.  However, there has also been a lack of investment in the Odlums mill and I hope this will not be replicated in Portarlington because then we would see the Portarlington flour mill close down.</P>
        <P>One issue that concerns me is the recurring names that show up every time in respect of the closure of Irish Sugar, the closure of Jacob&rsquo;s and the transfer of all the brand names abroad.  These names have surfaced again.  Unfortunately, one such recurring name has been appointed to Bord Bia.  There is a concern that we will be left with brand names only and no production.  There will be Odlums flour in packages produced in Ireland.  Most people who go into the supermarket and see a bag of sugar with the label &ldquo;Sucra&rdquo; believe it is manufactured here and people continue to believe that Jacob&rsquo;s biscuits are manufactured in Tallaght.  More and more we are losing our brand names abroad and the Government should have concerns in this regard.  We cannot continue to lose brand names without keeping the manufacturing plants here.  I put it sincerely to the Minister of State that he should examine the names that crop up continually from Irish Sugar to Jacob&rsquo;s and through to the closure of this plant.  There is a serious concern in this regard.  I call on the Minister of State to take this on board and to investigate the matter further.</P>

        <P>I appreciate what Deputy Humphreys has said and I am totally in agreement in respect of what is happening.  One educational step is to encourage people to buy local and locally sourced products.  A survey was carried out in England as part of which people were asked about their preferred source of food.  They indicated that they would prefer to source it locally.  I fully agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  It is time there was a serious and proper debate held in the House on what products we buy and support.  I take on board everything the Deputy has said and I will discuss the matter with the Minister.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I have no wish to sound alarmist.  The Minister of State is fully aware of the issue facing the Health Service Executive in trying to provide support for maternity services in view of the number of highly qualified midwives who have built up a wealth of experience over many years but who are retiring from the health services sector.  As January draws to a close, we should know the full impact of the projected retirements up to 29 February this year.  That is something that we do not have to wait too much longer for.  We know that there will be fewer midwives working in the HSE in the months ahead.  That in itself will create huge difficulties but coupled with the projected rise in the birth rate, this will put huge additional pressure on the maternity services in this country.</P>
        <P>The director of the HSE&rsquo;s obstetrics and gynaecology programme, Professor Michael Turner, said on 18 January 2011 that staff reductions and cuts to the HSE maternity service programme could see an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s maternal and infant mortality rate.  That is a very serious statement from a highly qualified eminent person.  On 24 January 2012, consultant obstetrician Gerry Burke said, &ldquo;Unfortunately some babies and women may pay for [this] with their lives&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want to be alarmist but if there is a contingency plan in place it should be published in advance.  The Government and the HSE should outline it quite clearly in order to allay everybody&rsquo;s concerns.  I am not just talking about the concerns of pregnant mothers, but also the concerns of staff who are providing the front line services.  Will they have enough colleagues in the event of pressure coming on the service after 1 March?  The contingency plan should be published in the next few days, because at that stage, the Government will know how many people will be retiring on 29 February.</P>
        <P>The Government should not dismiss, as has been the case so far, the comments of eminent people who are at the coalface of health service delivery, and who have an in depth knowledge of the maternity services in this country.  They are saying quite clearly that there is potential risk to life in the event of there being no contingency plan in place and no increase in the number of midwives available to the HSE in providing services after 29 February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Kelleher for raising this issue. It is a matter of concern and is receiving much attention at the moment.  The Government is fully aware of the impact the early retirement package will have on the provision of all services nationally, including maternity services.  Together with the HSE, we are committed to minimising the impact through a range of strategies, including fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using available resources.  Our priority is the safe delivery of care for patients.  In this regard, the Minister for Health has requested the HSE to prioritise the ongoing delivery of safe patient services and to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to avoid risk in their delivery.</P>
        <P>Planning for the delivery of health services is undertaken within the context of the annual national service planning process.  This process ensures that all factors, such as budgets and staffing levels and any other emerging issues, including the impact of the retirements, are factored into the plan for the services to be delivered within the coming year.</P>
        <Col N="260" />
        <P Just="Left">In parallel with this process, each of the HSE&rsquo;s four regions is required to develop a more detailed regional service plan which translates the national goals and targets into service specific targets for the year.  All of the regional plans are being developed on the basis of the anticipated number of staff that will be in post after the end of February.  These plans are due to be finalised in early February.  Managing the specific risks associated with the forthcoming retirements has been undertaken within this planning context.</P>
        <P>During 2011, the HSE established a process to identify and record the number of staff expected to retire before the end of February 2012.  This information has been updated on a regular basis as retirements become known.  The HSE is now finalising the figures for the actual number of staff who will retire at the end of next month.  However, it should be remembered that staff who have indicated that they wish to retire still have the possibility to change their minds.  It is not possible, therefore, to provide definitive figures today.  Subject to this consideration, the HSE&rsquo;s latest information, supplied today, shows that a national total of 34 midwives have indicated their intention to retire at the end of February 2012.</P>
        <P>Contingency plans are being developed to cover any gaps that may arise in staffing as a result of these midwives retiring.  These plans are at an advanced stage.  The scope to replace the staff who will retire is in itself limited, so we need to adopt an innovative approach.  Addressing the reduction in staff numbers as a result of these retirements, as well as the wider programme of reducing public sector numbers, requires more significant productivity increases as well as changes to organization structures and work practices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is continuing to utilise the provisions of the Croke Park agreement as it seeks to change staff rosters, work practices and to redeploy staff.  This will assist in minimising the service impact.  Contingency plans to address the impact of the retirements include a focus on staff redeployment and streamlining and amalgamation of some management structures and services.  The HSE will seek to deliver greater productivity through the national clinical programmes.  These programmes are a key strategic support to the risk management process which is in place around these retirements.  The related work of the special delivery unit will also be critical in supporting the achievement of overall resource management in the coming year.</P>
        <P>A number of additional initiatives are set out in the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan that will assist in minimising the impact of the retirements on services.  These include focused recruitment within the context of the cost containment plans and budgets for each service.  Agency staff may be used where there is a critical requirement.  The national service plan also makes provision for some conversion of agency costs into whole-time equivalent staff which will be explored in limited circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are very much aware of the potential impact of the upcoming retirements.  We have taken steps to ensure that the impact is minimised and that the safe delivery of services for patients is prioritised.  I believe that with good planning and a co-operative approach by all, we can continue to ensure the best possible service for patients.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply but I do not believe that the HSE has a contingency plan in place.  A quarter of the total number of midwives in the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital are leaving at the end of the month.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea has raised these concerns on a number of occasions.  The consultant obstetrician, Gerry Burke, has said that people could die.  These are not outrageous comments.  They are comments of concern coming from eminent people who are expressing the view that there is no contingency plan.  He said that if there was such a plan, the HSE and the Government are not sharing it with anybody who should be involved in delivering a plan to make sure that we have safe delivery of babies in this country.  It is incredible at this stage that the HSE has not got a <Col N="261" />contingency plan that it can show to the people.  We are one month away from an exodus of the most experienced midwives in this country.</P>
        <P>While I thank the Minister of State for her reply, I know that it is a reply that was scribbled together from the HSE contingency plans.  There is no meat in it.  It is basically a bland answer to fob me off.   The bottom line is that the director of the HSE&rsquo;s obstetrics and gynaecology programme, Professor Michael Turner, and a consultant obstetrician, Gerry Burke, have clearly stated that this could cost lives.  Accident and emergency and midwifery are the two key areas where we have to ensure that we have a competent number of staff in place at all times.  We can deal with elective surgery and so on at another time, but we cannot have a deficit in key front line services when we wake up on 1 March and realise that a quarter of the total number of midwives have retired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall">
        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I am not attempting to fob the Deputy off at all.  Nobody is under any illusion about the major challenges posed to many different public services, including the health service, following the retirements that will take place at the end of next month.  Contrary to media reports that 40 midwives are due to leave a specific hospital, the figures available to me indicate the total number of midwives nationally who have indicated an intention to take retirement is 34.</P>
        <P>The loss of midwives and many other critical front line staff poses a challenge.  For this reason, as I indicated, work is under way, following on from the service plan process, to draw up regional service plans taking account of the retirements that have been indicated.  Limited funding has been provided to backfill a number of posts, albeit not all of them, and work is under way to identify the posts that need to be filled.  In addition, we will use the Croke Park agreement to its fullest to secure the flexibility and redeployment of staff promised under the agreement.  This work is taking place as we speak and will continue until the end of February.  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by the forthcoming retirements, we are hopeful we will be able to continue to provide a level of service that meets demand and guarantees the safety of patients.  These are our priority concerns.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion.  The Minister of State will agree that the most effective crime policies, that is, those <Col N="262" />with a capacity to deliver for communities and individuals, focus on prevention.  Crime prevention strategies must take account of socio-economic circumstances.  In these tough economic times, policies such as cutting back on Garda stations and personnel do not do anything to alleviate the levels of crime faced by some communities.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust and Community Platform will hold a seminar on Thursday on the socio-economic causes of crime which I am sure will reinforce everything I have to say on the issue.  Investment in communities through the provision of funding to programmes which promote equality, prevent isolation, encourage healthy living and improve the environment and housing standards contributes to reducing crime levels.</P>
        <P>The Department is carrying out a review of the role of joint policing committees, which have an important part to play in reducing crime.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the review will investigate the viability of the committees or their operational side?  Having spoken to the Minister on this issue on previous occasions, I am aware that he agrees the committees are working very well in some areas and having visible benefits on the ground.  In areas where they work well a good membership balance has been struck between local politicians, garda&iacute;, community groups and officials from local authorities.  In other areas, however, joint policing committees are simply not working.  I have spoken to colleagues around the State about the committees and while some have indicated their local committee is working well, taking a proactive approach and having a positive effect on the ground, others have indicated that their local committee is little more than a talking shop.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate whether the review of the joint policing committees will focus on their viability or aspects of their operations?  Does she agree that they are a cost-effective means of addressing crime rates and provide a focused forum for local authorities and communities to have a very constructive input into how policing affects them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall">
        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets he is unable to be present due to other business.  The Minister has asked me to thank Deputy O&rsquo;Brien for raising this matter and indicated that he welcomes the opportunity for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the functions and powers of joint policing committees, JPCs, are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for a committee in each local authority area.  The Act provides that joint policing committees operate under guidelines issued in September 2008 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>With regard to the joint policing committees generally, it is fair to state that some are working better than others.  While a number of areas have well established JPCs, particularly those which were part of the initial pilot process that commenced in 2006, there are areas where committees have not been fully operational for long.  Therefore, any assessment of their activities must have regard to this context.  Inevitably, there will also be some differences in approach between committees in different local authority areas.  This is as it should be as flexibility is expected of the JPCs.  Clearly, there is likely to be a different set of issues arising for city area  joint policing committees compared to those dealing with more rural communities.</P>
        <P>The focus for joint policing committees must be to support appropriate local responses to local situations and the Minister does not wish to impose a heavy central hand on their deliberations.  With this in mind, the guidelines already allow considerable flexibility to committees in how they conduct their business.  For example, it is open to them to invite relevant people who are not committee members to participate in the discussion of particular agenda items.</P>
        <Col N="263" />
        <P>The Minister believes there is sufficient experience of the operation of the joint policing committees at this stage to begin to take stock of their progress and identify approaches which are working in some locations and may be applicable elsewhere.  As he informed the House previously, his Department, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, are carrying out an examination of their operation.  The intention is that a document will be prepared on the basis of which consultations will take place with local authorities and this in turn will facilitate any necessary updating of the guidelines.</P>
        <P>To help with this process the Department of Justice and Equality is conducting a short survey of all joint policing committees members which should provide a better overview of how the committees are operating.  Members have been asked to return survey forms by 6 February, after which the Department will collate the information received to summarise the principal issues and concerns expressed.  The resulting document will be made publicly available and submissions from Deputies and members of the public would be very welcome.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 also provides for the establishment of local policing fora at neighbourhood level.  These fora are intended to operate in a more informal way than the joint policing committees and deepen the engagement between garda&iacute;, the local authority and neighbourhood communities.  It was decided to prioritise the establishment of local policing fora in local authority areas where local drug task forces operate.  This is considered a reasonable approach at this time, given that the areas in question are where more complex crime issues are most likely to arise.  The review of joint policing committees will include a consideration of the role and extent of local policing fora.</P>
        <P>On crime levels, while joint policing committees can make an important contribution to our strategies to reduce and prevent crime, they are only part of the overall picture.  We must also acknowledge the consistent efforts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to confront crime and uphold the rule of law in our communities.  The Government is resolutely committed to confronting crime and enhancing public safety and its programme very much recognises and supports front line policing to achieve this objective.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I remind Deputies that work on developing a White Paper on crime is at an advanced stage in the Department of Justice and Equality, following an extensive consultation process.  One of the issues addressed in this exercise has been the role of the joint policing committees.  The Department engaged with the committees during the course of the consultation process and gained valuable insight which will feed into the examination the Minister has initiated.  The White Paper will set out a policy framework for future strategies to combat and prevent crime.  The intention is that this process will lead ultimately to a national anti-crime strategy in which the joint policing committees will have an important role to play.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in terms of the JPCs making a very important contribution to the overall reduction in, and prevention of, crime.  It is for that reason I hope when the review into the operation of the JPCs is concluded and published the Minister will commit to ensure they are well-resourced and well-financed.  Not to do so,  while recognising they have a very important role to play, is self-defeating.  Could we have some timeframe on when the White Paper on crime will be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall">
        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>The whole purpose of the review of the JPCs is to assess whether they are operating effectively and providing a real impetus to collaborative measures to support crime prevention and community safety.  Their effectiveness is being assessed.  We all agree the <Col N="264" />approach to tackling crime at community level is for all of the players to engage.  The idea of the JPCs is that they provide a forum for all the interested parties &mdash; critically, the statutory bodies and the local communities &mdash; to collaborate on how they might respond to problems of crime locally and especially, as Deputy O&rsquo;Brien mentioned, the prevention of crime.  Very often the concerns go far beyond the actual issues of crime and extend to the causes of crime as well.  The JPCs provide a very effective forum and we look forward to the information and the views of members coming back through the review currently underway.</P>
        <P>The local policing fora at neighbourhood level provide an effective response.  I attended one in my constituency last night and another one last week.  If we can achieve that level of engagement at local level, where people play an active part in addressing the crime problems in their immediate estate or locality, that is the solution in the long-term.  There is no easy solution.  Clearly the Garda has the principal role to play in combatting crime but it is about all the players, in particular the community, engaging and being active.  As we all agree, that is the most effective route to combatting crime.</P>

      <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by repeating that I fully subscribe to the freedoms, the opportunities and the access to information that the Internet provides us with.  Ireland is home to some of the world&rsquo;s most innovative Internet companies and we are determined to grow our reputation as a location where smart people and these smart companies can continue to innovate in this fast moving arena.</P>
      <P>The last thing innovators need is a culture where the outputs of their creative endeavours have to be locked away or kept secret for the fear of theft.  Ireland is very proud of the fact that we have a modern suite of intellectual property laws that by their very nature balance a range of competing interests and rights in a manner that is seen right across the globe as reasonable and proportionate.  I intend that this will continue.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposed statutory instrument, it may be useful to explain the background against which the requirement for an amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 has arisen.  In the EMI and others<i> v.</i> UPC High Court judgment of 11  October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton decided that he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and thus could not grant an injunction to prevent infringement of copyright against an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of &ldquo;mere conduit&rdquo; transient communications.  In doing so, he stated that Ireland had not fully transposed the relevant EU directives.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;mere  conduit&rdquo; principle provides that if an ISP does not initiate a transmission, or modify the material contained in a transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission, it is granted a &ldquo;safe harbour&rdquo; against liability by virtue of the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.  However, according to the same directive, this freedom from liability does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements.</P>
      <P>I point out that two EU directives, namely, the Copyright Directive 2001 and the Enforcement Directive 2004 require that the holders of copyright &mdash; authors, music composers, lyricists, <Col N="265" />record producers, etc. &mdash; are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  What is an intermediary?  In a nutshell, an intermediary is an ISP which provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet.</P>
      <P>My Department had considered that injunctions were available under section 40(4) of the Copyright Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  However, this was not Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s view.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to the legal advice, the Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for its advice as to the implications of the High Court judgment.  The office has advised that the obligation contained in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rightsholders must have a mechanism available to them to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  Separately the office advised that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance.</P>
      <P>I fully acknowledge that this is a very sensitive issue.  We seek to strike a balance between creators and users and intermediaries in regard to online services and businesses, which are of great importance to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  Considering this, and in the context of the obligations due under the EU directives, discussions took place with the Office of the Attorney General and the legal adviser in our Department in order to frame a draft regulation and put it into the public domain for consultation.  The regulation follows the wording of the copyright directive so that we are in compliance and includes a very important proviso that the courts shall have due regard to the rights of any person likely to be affected and this includes, where appropriate, a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This latter provision respects the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>After consultations with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, my Department launched a public consultation on the text of the proposed statutory instrument on 17 June 2011.  In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Association of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Limited, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, the IDA, IMIR, the International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone and Xtra-vision.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.  The consultation attracted over 50 submissions from interested parties.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue, as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for further consideration.</P>
      <P>Following this, and after meetings with interested parties, it is clearly necessary to proceed with the statutory instrument which will restate the law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries which was considered to pertain prior to the judgment.  This will make compliance with the copyright directive manifestly clear.  The wording of the statutory instrument has been formally drafted and the text was published last Thursday, 26 January.</P>
      <P>There is no change of policy being put forward in the proposed legislative measure. It is merely a restatement of the position that was considered to be in place before a High Court <Col N="266" />judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in October 2010.  I would like people to note the timeline, which was in October 2010.  Ireland is obliged to provide that rightsholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that legal proceedings against the State have been issued by the plaintiffs in the UPC case and damages arising from a successful challenge could be substantial.  The European Commission also requested information, on 22 December 2011, on Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the copyright directive.</P>
      <P>While the copyright directive requires that rights holders must be able to seek an injunction against intermediaries to prevent or terminate an infringement, the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights &mdash; such as the right to freedom of expression and information, data protection, and the right to conduct a business &mdash; and that any remedy must be proportionate.</P>
      <P>No national authority or court can require an ISP to carry out general monitoring of the information that it transmits on its network.  This means an ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  National courts must strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures.</P>
      <P>As regards relevant case law, I refer to the recent Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, case, Scarlet<i> v.</i> Sabam, C-70/10, which enunciated the general principles in relation to the balances required to be taken into account.  In this case on 24 November 2011, the CJEU clearly laid out the aforementioned principles that will guide all national courts in future.</P>
      <P>I beg your indulgence on this, Acting Chairperson, because there are some pertinent points.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read faster.</P>
      <P>In that case, the CJEU also found that requiring an ISP to install a contested filtering system would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware that concerns have been expressed that the proposed statutory instrument mirrors the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States.  However, I would point out that these concerns are not based on fact.  The most worrying aspects of the US proposals would involve blocking access to websites internationally; taking down entire websites for one infringing item; blocking access to websites by the US state enforcement without notice; targeting companies between the site and end-user, without notice &mdash; for example, service providers, search engines, payment network providers and advertising networks; imposing a monitoring of content requirement on Internet companies and, in effect, forcing them to self-censor; extension of criminal liability; the by-passing of safe-harbour provisions in copyright law; lack of due process; disregard for fundamental human rights; and the involvement of government in civil infringement areas, etc.</P>
      <Col N="267" />
      <P>I would stress that such a regime could not be introduced in the EU, where the safe-harbour provisions are protected in the e-commerce directive and where, in implementing EU law, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights must be applied.  This includes the right to conduct a business, protection of data, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information with the right to intellectual property.  Critically, any order granted must be proportionate.  These matters must be considered when deliberating on the granting of an injunction.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance to note that the purpose of the proposed statutory instrument is simply to provide explicitly that injunctions may be sought, as obligated by the two EU directives that I have already referred to, namely, the copyright directive, 2001 and the enforcement directive, 2004.  It should also be noted that such injunctions are available in all other EU member states by virtue of the two directives already referred to.  They have been required since at least December 2002 and since that time the Internet has flourished.</P>
      <P>In granting such injunctions, the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgments.  As I have already stated, these judgments require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  The statutory instrument is sufficient because, particularly following the Court of Justice decision in the Scarlet<i> v.</i> Sabam case, the courts have authoritative guidance on the balance to be achieved between, on the one hand, intellectual property rights and, on the other hand, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet service providers, the protection of private data, the right of freedom of expression and information, and proportionality of any remedy.</P>

      <P Just="Left">My Department launched an independent review committee on 9 May 2011, with a view to examining and reviewing the existing Irish copyright and legislative framework.  The copyright review committee is an independent body.  Its terms of reference are clear and, in general, are concerned with identifying any areas that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation, and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified.</P>
      <Col N="268" />
      <P>Following the advice of both the former and current Attorneys General, it is considered necessary that Ireland&rsquo;s position in ensuring that rightsholders can apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are being used to infringe their copyright, must be restated.   Otherwise, the State is at risk of actions against it, which would probably result in substantial damages.  Nothing the review committee could suggest can change this fact.  It is difficult to see what conditions could be attached to the statutory instrument that are not already provided for by EU law, for example, data protection, freedom of expression, information, and freedom to conduct a business.  The copyright review committee is expected to publish its first consultation paper shortly following consideration of the submissions received.  One of the items for further consideration could be a voluntary forum for all stakeholders, in which various copyright matters could be discussed.</P>
      <P>An intermediary is an ISP that provides mere conduit, caching or hosting services on the Internet.  As such, an entity such as <i>www.boards.ie</i>, because it avails of the hosting exemption, could be considered an intermediary.  However, no injunction may be taken against it provided it abides by the notice and take down procedures as set out in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, to which section 40(4) refers.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, in proposing to amend the copyright legislation, I am particularly conscious of the importance of online content and digital businesses in the Irish context and, by introducing the proposed statutory instrument, I am simply seeking to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s continued compliance with its obligations under the relevant EU directives following the decision of the High Court in the aforementioned UPC case.  It is clear from the rulings of the European court that any remedy applied will have to be proportionate and we can be confident that this approach protects rightsholders by allowing them the access to the courts that we must provide while protecting the fundamental rights of third parties and fellow citizens.</P>
      <P>Changes are expected at EU level in several areas affecting e-commerce.  For instance, the main objective of the informal competitiveness Council in Copenhagen on 2 and 3 of February 2012 is to reach a common understanding of the most important, concrete actions needed at EU level and in member states to create a well-functioning digital Single Market.  It is understood that discussions will be held on the necessity for providing clarification at EU level on the liability of Internet service providers and to provide certainty for those providers when made aware of illegal content on their websites.  Among other proposals, a European framework for notice and action procedures will be considered.</P>
      <P>Going back to 22 December 2002, the date by which every EU member state had to have implemented Directive 2001/29/EC, every EU country has had to &ldquo;ensure that rightholders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right&rdquo;.  Having that provision enshrined in EU law and the laws of member states for a decade has not restricted the development of the Internet or innovative Internet companies.  On the contrary, the Internet has flourished.  I thank the Acting Chairman for her indulgence in granting me a few extra minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I appreciate the Government&rsquo;s decision to organise a debate on the subject but this is not the way to deal with a subject of this magnitude.  We need a more considered debate, along the lines proposed by Deputy Martin, such as a select sub-committee of the D&aacute;il to examine this area of major importance.  I am one of the few people who raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on Question Time with the Minister of State.  I do not have a vested interest but I was approached by someone who represents copyright owners to find out what was happening and how the Government was going to respond to the EMI case.  I thank <Col N="269" />the Minister of State for the courtesy with which he received my representations.  He was very helpful.</P>
      <P>The copyright directives of 1980 and 1984 intended that an injunction could be granted against Internet service providers.  That was the clear intention and we all assumed it was the law.  The matter was tested before the courts and the court took the view that the legislation transposing the directive could not allow for injunctions.  Therefore, the directive was not properly transposed into Irish law and Mr. Justice Charleton said that he would have loved to grant an injunction but the drafting of the law did not allow him to do so.  It is clear that we are under an obligation to comply with EU directives and to transpose EU directives properly.  The Minister of State mentioned damages but this is part of our international obligations.  We accepted the EU directive and legislation was passed to transpose it so we must bring it into effect.  Every other country in Europe has brought it into effect properly.  The Minister of State referred to European law and the Sabam case, the principles of which will be relied upon in the courts when deciding on how to implement this.</P>
      <P>In a fast evolving situation such as this, there is an argument that it is preferable for judicial discretion and judicial law-making to deal with this situation.  However, in a matter of this importance, the fundamental principles should be laid down by the Irish Parliament.  The Minister of State said recently that it was not the Government&rsquo;s intention that Internet sites be closed down but if that is not his intention, why not put his intention in legislative form?  That is the least required.  We are abdicating responsibility to the Judiciary.  While I have confidence in judges, I do not know the extent to which they will be persuaded by the principles of European law.  I am familiar with the terms of the e-commerce directive but this is a matter for Parliament, not the Judiciary.  We should set down the broad principles in this House.  We all deplore piracy and we recognise the rights of copyright owners, which must be balanced against the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy of end users and the absolute necessity for this country to have a robust and trading Internet.  The representatives of the people in Parliament should be deciding this, not the Judiciary.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a bigger picture and perhaps it is time to revisit the EU directive, which is more than ten years old.  The situation has evolved considerably in the meantime.  In the United States, piracy has reduced substantially because there are 800 systems through which this material can be legally distributed on payment of a modest fee.  The precedent for that in this country is the agreement between Eircom and IRMA, which led to MusicHub, where people can download music on payment of a modest fee.  The empirical evidence shows that if such a system is in place, people will opt for the legal system.  There will always be some people who opt for the illegal system.  That is the direction in which we should move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">This issue led to a huge public reaction.  A huge number of e-mails opposed the intention of the Minister of State to sign the order and organisers of an online petition said they have collected over 80,000 signatures.  I spoke to the Minister of State last week.  The raising of the issue by Members has led to this time being set aside to debate the issue, which I welcome.  This debate will be meaningless if the Minister of State signs the order anyway.  If there is to be genuine debate, the Minister of State should suspend the order, publish primary draft legislation and proceed in the normal way through the Oireachtas.  That would require a more comprehensive measure and would allow for genuine debate and input from interested parties.  It would provide the opportunity to ensure that any legislation, ostensibly to protect the rights of copyright holders, would not threaten access and freedom of information at the same time.</P>
      <P>I also remind the Minister of State that the programme for Government undertook not to continue with the unhealthy practices of incorporating EU directives into domestic law unless <Col N="270" />as part of primary legislation.  I suggest in light of the huge reaction to this and the implications it might have, this represents a good opportunity to put that promise into effect.  The absence of democratic scrutiny on this measure has been highlighted by critics, as has the fact that the statutory instrument, as drafted, gives too much interpretive powers to the courts.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons for the order is Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s order in the case brought by EMI.  Allied to that was the apparent threat by other copyright interests to take action against the State.  Is it the case that the Government would rather issue a diktat to placate the major music companies than deal with this issue in a legislative matter which would take into account a broader range of interests and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and European rights?</P>
      <P>I particularly stress the dangers of not simply translating court judgments into legislation, given that in a previous case involving Internet access Mr. Justice Charleton admitted he made a mistake.  The case involved was brought by EMI which forced Eircom to block access to a site called Pirate Bay.  Mr. Justice Charleton granted the order but later admitted he had been mistaken in doing so in the absence of any notice to the request for information from the party affected, Pirate Bay.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The implication of the statutory instrument which the Minister proposes to sign and of the ACTA legislation which will come before the European Parliament in a few months is even more serious.  Those who are knowledgeable about the area, including many who are part of what is a relatively thriving sector of the economy, believe if the trend towards restricting access on the Internet is successful much of its value would be lost.  It will also threaten a significant number of jobs in the State.</P>
      <P>While intellectual property rights need to be protected, measures framed at the behest of, or to reflect court decisions in favour of large music companies, for example, are not the correct way to proceed.  It has also been pointed out by people with expertise in this area that the decision of the European Court of Justice in a recent case has not been taken into account in drafting the statutory instrument.  The court referred to a number of tests it said needed to be applied before an injunction could be granted against a site.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While there are people who profit from pirating music and film, most of what is uploaded onto the Internet is done on an individual basis.  It has become a huge area and one in which those with expertise rarely threaten the rights of individual musicians or other artists.  There must be some way of tackling large-scale commercial piracy without restricting the sort of information and other sharing that is such a major part of the use of the Internet.  I would therefore call on the Minister of State to withdraw the proposed statutory instrument and put his proposal in draft legislation that can be properly debated and decided upon in the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to start by saying I fully support the protection of copyrighted material.  I thank the Minister of State for pausing in signing the legislation in order to allow for this debate.  I accept legislation is required to comply with the recent High Court decision and EU directives in this area.  </P>
      <P>There are three reasons why additional clauses need to be added to the statutory instrument.  The first is that the principle of targeting intermediaries is a fundamentally flawed approach.  The second is that the statutory instrument will not have the desired effect.  The third is that <Col N="271" />while it will not have the desired effect, it could have several undesired and unintended effects and consequences.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In terms of the principle of targeting intermediaries rather than the perpetrator, I will outline how this works.  If someone posts a YouTube video link on Facebook the law, at its extreme, could allow an injunction which would force the ISP to block access to Facebook for Irish users.  It would be like forcing National Toll Roads to shut down entire stretches of motorway in order to avoid speeding because it cannot find people who are doing it.  The EU implemented the intermediary rather than the perpetrator approach several years ago.  However, it has since said it was the wrong approach and is actively considering ways to develop a new approach.  I have several quotes from very relevant people which I can supply the Minister of State with.  It accepts it was not the correct approach.</P>
      <P>In terms of the approach not having the desired effect, the real objective is to stop large-scale providers of pirated material being able to supply it in a readily available manner online.  We all know there are very negative consequences if that happens.  The technical experts I have spoken to have said the providers of the sort of material, like BitTorrent, can get around court injunctions in about five minutes.  One expert said it is beyond laughable to suggest that this will do more than amuse the pirates.  Ofcom, the UK regulator, said for all blocking methods circumvention by site operators and Internet users is technically possible and relatively straightforward.  We also know other countries which have implemented this have seen a temporary dip in piracy traffic but it then increased again.</P>
      <P>There are three unintended consequences, to which I will return in the question and answer session.  Many online companies are afraid they will have to be shut down.  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a smart economy could be damaged and Internet access and freedoms in Ireland could be greatly curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and Government for providing time for this very important debate.  Deputy Donnelly outlined some of the main issues and objections many people who have approached us have concerns about.  I raised some of the same issues last Thursday during a Topical Issues debate.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of people have been mobilised on this matter.  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland voiced its concern about the vague wording and stated the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be respected for both users and service providers.  Its members include Google, Eircom and UPC.  It is worth restating &mdash; Deputy Donnelly already made the point &mdash; that neither he nor I object to the proper exercise of EU copyright law in this country.  We understand the obligations on the Minister of State to vindicate that law.  I appreciate he has been put in a difficult place.</P>
      <P>It is in that spirit that we made an alternative proposal which we delivered to his office earlier today.  We were trying to strike a fairer balance.  I would like to thank T. J. McIntyre and Simon McGarr for their expertise and assistance in this regard.  Crucially, the alternative wording lays out a number of specific considerations that must be taken into account by any judge setting down some boundaries when deciding the grounds upon which an injunction might be granted under the Act.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Specific freedoms, such as those listed in the Scarlet <i>v</i>. Sabam decision in the European Court of Justice, to which the Minister of State referred, include the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the right to receive or impart information.  The wording also lays out specific recourse to the Data Protection Commissioner by requiring the court to notify it if it considers that the right to the protection of personal data may be affected by the granting of an injunction.</P>
      <Col N="272" />
      <P Just="Left">In respect of costs, the burden which may be placed upon an intermediary against whom any junction may be sought should by rights be borne by the applicant and the text reflects that.  We need to recognise that primary legislation is the most appropriate way to make these regulations.  We propose a sunset clause which would expire in two years&rsquo; time.  The copyright review committee, to which the Minister of State referred, chaired by Dr. Eoin O&rsquo;Dell, is expected to complete its work in the summer.  It would be an ideal opportunity to commence work on primary legislation.</P>
      <P>We offer this remedy in the spirit of trying to show a balanced approach to applying EU copyright law in Ireland and also reassuring Internet users, providers, website owners and online businesses that they have nothing to worry about if they use the Internet fairly and honestly.  I hope the Minister of State would be in a position to take some of our proposals on board. We want to try to resolve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on what he is doing because we are trying to address a very difficult issue.  Could this instrument have a significant effect on an ISP?  ISPs are vital to our future.  How might the statutory instrument have an impact on businesses?  Will the Minister of State comment on whether a company could use the cost of an injunction to bully an ISP into an action that may not be helpful or expected?  From what the Minister of State said, it seems we comply with EU law, yet the courts seem to disagree with what we have on our Statute Book.  Will the Minister of State answer these questions to clarify matters?</P>
      <P>It should be made crystal clear to every Member that this provision is nothing like the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States, which is a far more draconian provision.  Our measure is trying to achieve the balance the Minister of State is talking about.  We must raise these specific issues, which are so important to businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my speech, one must have regard to proportionality.  The Sabam ruling is such that if somebody were to seek an injunction before a judge, the latter would have to establish that infringement occurred in the first instance.  In making such a decision, a judge must have regard to the basic rights that exist.    Members articulated the circumstances that arise in this regard with reference to the EU charter of fundamental rights and the rights in the copyright directive.  A judge would have to have regard to the facts that there is a copyright holder and that there is an individual ISP, a business, with the right to conduct its business, as is inherent in the EU copyright directive.  In other words, the right of the copyright holder is not superior to that of the individual citizen or business.</P>
      <P>With regard to seeking an injunction and measuring costs, there is no way of determining the actual cost, even though individuals have come forward with proposals on the cost of a High Court injunction.  I would have faith in the fact that the Irish judicial system would have to have regard to the fact that there are specific rights regarding monitoring, especially in light of the Sabam ruling.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the effect on an ISP, one must ask what is an intermediary.  I have outlined this in my speech and will probably not repeat it.  It is question of proportionality.  If a person is accessing a site such as <i>www.youtube.com</i> and is not acting legally, a court would have to have regard to <Col N="273" />the need for proportionality.  Why would an Irish court shut down an Irish website, potentially with millions of users, because of the actions of one person?  One could argue it would be an infringement of the right of the business person to conduct his business.  The issue of proportionality, therefore, must come into play.  There are certain fundamental rights that must be adhered to.  Before an injunction is sought, a judge in Ireland would have to have complete regard for those rights.  I hope that answers the question.</P>

      <P>This is a complex issue and it has many aspects, not all of which I understand fully.  However, I have been acquainting myself with them over the past week or two.  The issue is one in respect of which there is strong feeling.  It has considerable economic implications in that rash moves in this area could do reputational damage to Ireland as a hub for IT and new technologies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may inform me on the process.  I learned only in the past year what a statutory instrument is.  It is a ministerial order that does not require the normal legislative process, parliamentary scrutiny and debate.  Those watching this debate need to know that also.  Is there a reason, given the concerns that have been raised quite widely in Ireland, and which are causing uproar in countries such as Germany and the United States, we could not stop bringing this order into force and go through the longer process involving proper legislation, such that all sides would have an opportunity to make submissions and examine the issues fully?</P>
      <P>It is very complicated.  I have not made my decision but, as I understand it, it is not clear that we are in breach.  The European Commission has not said we are in breach and a recent ruling in the European Court of Justice stated the use of blocking had to be limited, precisely because it infringed on freedom of expression and could target lawful communications unfairly.  It would hit intermediaries, as others have said.  It would send out a very good signal if the Government did not just push this instrument through by order and allowed for a fuller debate and submissions from all sides so we could be ahead of the curve on an issue that has not been resolved, even at European level.  Let us lead the way and have a proper, informed debate and try to balance, in a fair way, all the various competing concerns of artists, musicians and holders of copyright with the importance of upholding Internet freedom and freedom of expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s points.  I do not believe reputational damage will arise from this.  It is a statutory instrument.  We must ask its purpose.  We must bear in mind Mr. Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment in the case of EMI and others <i>v.</i> UPC.  Advice received from the Attorney General under the last and current mandates stated that, in order to remove any doubt as to the right of the copyright holder to seek an injunction, the best approach would be to amend existing legislation.  In this statutory instrument, all we are doing is amending existing legislation, namely the Copyright Act.  Having regard to the Charleton ruling, we are putting ourselves in a position in which there will be no doubt as to whether we will be compliant with EU law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it allow for blocking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I draw attention to the circumstances that would obtain if we were not a party to the EMI and others v. UPC case.  It could be stated that, under the Copy<Col N="274" />right Act 2000, the right to seek an injunction over an infringement already existed.  We are merely restating that position.</P>
      <P>The reason for much of the controversy on this stems from the fact that this issue has been arising for well over a year, bearing in mind the Charleton judgment was in 2010.  The new Government instigated a review and engaged in consultation.  People are accusing us of not consulting but we had a consultation period.  I made it clear to people that I was open to discussions with all stakeholders on this issue.  As late as last Thursday, I met the Irish Internet Association and had further discussions with it.</P>
      <P>We are not trying to impose something.  If we were to legislate from a primary perspective in regard to the Internet, we would have to be very careful about how we would do that given there are so many disparate communities within the web space as well as the copyright holders.  My preferred option, given the EU is now looking at the copyright or e-commerce directive, is that the community would start talking across the various and disparate groupings, such as the hosters, the ISPs, the software developers, the copyright holders and so on.  It is important that this community starts to consult with the various stakeholders within the community to begin the process of coming up with a strategic view as to how we can either legislate primarily or put in place voluntary agreements.</P>
      <P>My preferred option is for voluntary agreements because assuming all stakeholders come to the table honestly and openly, this ensures that if primary legislation is implemented it does not become outmoded or outdated as soon as it is enacted by virtue of further innovations within the web.  What we are doing here is merely restating a position which we hold to have already existed, namely, upholding the right of the copyright holder while having regard to the balance of rights in that respect.</P>
      <P>I do not believe primary legislation is required at this stage.  The Technical Group has put forward a proposal for a statutory instrument.  If time allows and bearing in mind there are more questions to follow, I would like to answer the individual points the Technical Group has made given it has put forward an honest and open solution to this issue.  While I have only had a brief few hours to analyse it, since it was submitted today at 12.45 p.m., there are some issues within it which I would like to address because I consider it an honest effort to address the issues at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoghanMurphy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note the Minister of State has consulted extensively on this issue.  He continued to do so when concerns were raised, and we have this debate today as a result.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that this is a complicated issue and it is difficult to know just how big a deal it is or whether to believe the hype.  A number of small tech firms have come to me with concerns about it and, at the same time, I have spoken to larger organisations which are not that concerned.  It is important to note that Facebook recently decided it was going to expand its operations here, and it would surely have considered this before it decided that.</P>
      <P>A question has been floating around on the Internet, in e-mails and on some of the boards about the kind of open-ended powers this would give the courts to step in and make certain judgments or findings against ISPs or individuals, and about the rights on the part of users or website owners to defend themselves before, say, their site was blocked.  There is some concern that this is not concrete in the statutory instrument so that it might be found a ruling could set a precedent which could have unforeseen implications down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister of State to say the EU is revisiting the copyright directive?  I hope so, because it should be, although I do not know how long this will take to resolve if that is the case.</P>
      <Col N="275" />
      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister of State to proceed immediately to sign the statutory instrument in the absence of any guidance to the courts as to how they will exercise their powers to grant injunctions?  For example, the Minister of State said he is confident the courts will act in accordance with the principle of proportionality and that he does not think the courts will block websites.  Why not write that down?  Why not put it in the form of legislation?  This is the Irish Parliament.  Ireland is the only country that will be affected if there is undue disruption of the Internet because of the way the judges interpret the scope of the powers we are now giving them.  Why not restrict those powers?  At the same time as making it explicit that judges can grant injunctions, why not simply write it in the rules which will govern the granting of those injunctions?</P>
      <P>I do not believe that is an unreasonable thing to ask.  It is the least we should ask the Government to do before it signs off on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Eoghan Murphy&rsquo;s point, Ireland has the concept of the take-down notice.  I use <i>www.boards.ie</i> and there are other examples with which we are all familiar, such as YouTube.  If a person becomes a member of <i>www.boards.ie</i>, the presumption is that the person has signed up to a set of behavioural protocols by which he or she will abide, and will not say anything defamatory or do anything that is in breach of copyright, as an individual user.  If the person does that, there is a mechanism so that, through its own monitoring mechanisms, <i>www.boards.ie</i> can expel an errant user or somebody who is, if I may use the term, acting the maggot.  Therefore, this already exists as a voluntary code dealing with behaviour.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If, however, we begin legislating in a proscriptive way for every single behaviour on the Internet, we will be going down a very narrow funnel.  As I have stated and to answer Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s question, the informal competitiveness council is to try to come up with a set of actions in regard to the issues we are talking about, which is the correct approach.  However, the reason we have had to implement the statutory instrument, as the Deputy will appreciate given he was a member of the last Government, is that this has been ongoing for a considerable period and the State is potentially exposed to being sued by various entities.  I must have regard to the fact it is taxpayers&rsquo; money which is potentially in question.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The point is that I do not believe an Irish judge, if he or she is having regard to the e-commerce directive, will not also have regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has come into operation and is the legal entity, and also the Sabam ruling.  I do not believe any Irish judge would not adhere to the principles of proportionality in this sense.</P>
      <P Just="Left">To go back to the point about take-down notices, if a hoster decides it is not going to take down the content following a take-down notice on the assumption that this take-down notice is on foot of a real breach of copyright, perhaps it is then open for the person against whom the infringement occurs to seek the injunction.  What we want to do is to get into a space in this country where the system operates on a voluntary basis, with clear protocols.  To be fair, the music industry needs to adopt new models and needs to begin to get its music on to more platforms, as noted by Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and needs to begin finding new mechanisms for selling its music.  Already, Netflix is coming on stream, which will also give rise to issues.  The more content that is legally available through a multitude of mechanisms, the less likely it is we will encounter copyright theft and piracy issues.</P>
      <P>That is where we want to get to.  However, I do not believe the State should be too prescriptive about how we get to that point.  I would like to see the community coming together on that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that this order can be used by companies to secure the sort of site injunctions which the European Court itself has ruled unlawful?  Does it not also open opportunities for large corporations to close down sites through injunctions against smaller, weaker companies that would not find themselves in a position to defend themselves because of the costs involved?  Does it not open that can of worms in regard to the large corporations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekKeating">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Derek Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will remember that I raised this issue last week in the topical issue debate.  I wish to come at it from a slightly different angle, given the contributions in the extended debate today.  Given the enormous concerns throughout the nation, the confusion and, in certain cases, the great misunderstanding, might the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department help to allay people&rsquo;s fears?  The Minister of State might take the unusual step, for a Minister, of taking out an advertisement in some branch of the media as an opportunity to allay people&rsquo;s concerns, of which there are volumes, as well as the considerable amount of misunderstanding and misinformation I have come across recently.  This is not helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s point.  People are interpreting this as us doing the bidding of the large corporations.  This is not the stop on-line piracy act, SOPA.  We are not extending massive powers of intervention so that we can step into the breach to try to protect one side over another.  This is not SOPA legislation.  This is balancing the right of a copyright holder against the right of an individual.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There are inherent rights in the charter of fundamental rights and in the e-commerce directive which give rights to the individual company to conduct its business.  We must also have regard to the rights of the copyright holder, which could be a small publishing house.  People perceive the copyright holder to be &ldquo;big music&rdquo; but it could be a small Internet publishing business, a person creating his or her own music at home.  They have copyright and certain protections.  I do not believe this measure will be used by big business as a tool to beat down websites.  Google is one of the biggest corporations in the world and it has a right to do business here if it has an Irish or European Union domain.  Those rights are protected but are not subservient to the right of the copyright holder.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy up on a point he made about the statutory instrument.  He is infinitely more experienced than I am, as a legislator, and he will appreciate that this is not new policy and therefore a statutory instrument can apply.  We are not at odds with the programme for Government in this because we are only amending legislation.   I reply respectfully to the Deputy in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is a balancing between the two.  The small guy or girl who begins with the gaming industry has certain rights as copyright holders and we must protect them as much as we must protect the citizen&rsquo;s right to access the Internet.  Proportionality is the key to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State claims this is a restatement of policy rather than a new policy position.  If this is the case why would the courts interpret it in any other way?  It is clearly a change in policy &mdash; it must be.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Our point is that there is a lack of grounded policy in respect of copyright law as it relates to the Internet.  What we propose in our alternative wording is that in the meantime, until we get to the point of having good grounded legislation, certain boundaries should be set.  These would be such that the Data Protection Commissioner would require the court to notify the commissioner&rsquo;s office if it considers that the right to protection of personal data would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  That was one of the points we made in our document.  A second point was that the statutory instrument should state very clearly the case concerning <Col N="277" />freedom, for example, in regard to the Scarlet <i>v</i>. Sabam case.  People could then see what the statutory instrument contains and that would give some protection.  In addition, it is not unreasonable to include a sunset clause in regard to when the primary legislation might be enacted.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the small guy.  This measure could ruin, not the big people, but those on the way up, the intermediate people.  If this were to go badly wrong it could ruin a person&rsquo;s prospects, for example, if there was a court injunction to which he or she had to contribute some or all of the costs.</P>
      <P>Consider the Digital Hub where last year there were in the order of 18 new companies.  As we all know, this is one of our bright spots, as is the artistic community.  It is a question of finding the right balance.  That small guy could be badly burned if the issue of awarding costs is not addressed.  It is a potential David and Goliath situation.  On one hand there is the big music industry, on the other a small intermediate person.</P>
      <P>Those were the four principal points we stated in our draft statutory instrument.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State were to return on those points and, in addition, let us know if there will be scope to reconsider this issue with a view to making changes before the measure is signed.  We need to know the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on this, one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister of State his task.  I have never seen so many e-mails coming in.  We must differentiate between the keyboard warriors who, in some cases, border on anarchism and those who are genuinely creative and passionate about this.  That is important for those who are creative or into gaming.  The Minister knows well we are trying to be the hub for gaming in the western world and it is important.</P>
      <P>I have some simple and basic questions.  What are the implications for the protection of individual freedom?  Can the Minister of State reassure the House that the ISPs will not track and demonise the ordinary citizen who is not involved in the copyright cartel, nor out to make anything from this?  I am reassured by his remarks in regard to the balancing act. However, some people I have been talking to and liaising with, who have given me their real names and engaged with me in a proper manner, have expressed worry that this statutory instrument is vague, perhaps leaving the  courts with too much of a margin for discretion.  Is it the case that we are jumping through hoops for big business, which I accept also has rights, at the expense of the small person?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s opening speech to the House was welcome.  I join Deputy Keating who said we should tell this story better.  I compliment the Minister of State.  He has been available, has met and spoken to, not only Members, but other people in the House and in the wider community.  The last thing we need is to lose the culture of creativity and innovation, to which the Minister of State referred.  I know that is not his<i> modus operandi</i>.  However, it is important that we allay fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point, I will address the points submitted by the Technical Group in regard to the statutory instrument.  I will briefly give my analysis of them.  There is not a great deal of difference between the two statutory instruments.  I respect the point made.  We are not setting out a new policy framework but clarifying legislation through an amendment to the copyright Act.  We are going back to the position prior to the EMI <i>v</i>. UPC case where the right to seek an injunction by a copyright holder was there.</P>
      <P>I note the Technical Group&rsquo;s alternative clauses propose the statutory instrument be of two-year duration.  We have to monitor events, however, in the intervening two years and move quickly if essential balances are not maintained.  That would be impeded by a two-year clause.</P>
      <Col N="278" />
      <P>On the Technical Group&rsquo;s paragraph c, my proposed statutory instrument already includes a provision that the courts will have due regard to the rights of any person affected by virtue of the grant of any such injunction and the court will give such direction, including where appropriate a direction requiring a person to be notified of the application.  This covers the Technical Group&rsquo;s point and to our mind it would be the action of a prudent judge.</P>
      <P>On paragraph d, the remedy of damages will not be available against an intermediary provided it abides by the e-commerce directive.  Again, the e-commerce directive has certain rights which protect the business.  Given the wide variety of circumstances that may prevail, it is felt the best approach is to have the matter dealt with case by case through a judicial process which must balance all the rights involved.  Protections are already in place under European law.  The European Court of Justice requires all remedies must be proportionate while the right to freedom of expression and to conduct a business must be balanced with the right to intellectual property in considering the granting of an injunction.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights provides in law for the protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to property and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>On paragraph e, one cannot predict future circumstances.  That is why we again feel the best approach is to deal with the matter case by case through the judicial process.  Many rights are involved in this paragraph such as the right to copyright and to intellectual property in general.  The first matter to be considered is to establish if there is an infringement.  If lawful content is also included, the right of making available by the owner of the lawful content has to be considered.  The rights of the citizen, consumer and end-user in freedom of expression and freedom to receive or impart information must also be taken into account.  The right to data protection must come into the mix on the point made by the Technical Group.  The right of the Internet service provider, ISP, to conduct a business and all that it entails must also be upheld.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of clarity, the Technical Group submitted an alternative statutory instrument, and I am addressing specific points in it.</P>
      <P>On paragraphs f and g of the Technical Group&rsquo;s submission concerning injunctions, these matters are already within the discretion of the court.  EU law has held any measures must be fair and proportionate and not excessively costly.  Yet again, given the varying circumstances that could arise, we feel a case-by-case analysis and the balancing of rights and consideration of all matters by judicial process is the proper forum for such decisions.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Keating&rsquo;s point about publicising this, I want to reiterate we had an open consultation on it.  I stated on the record I was available to meet anybody.  I have sent out three communications to all Deputies, across all parties, and Senators on this issue so far.  I have engaged with the media in as open a fashion as possible.  I am willing to talk to people and am making myself available to the Internet community to talk to it on this.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Buttimer&rsquo;s point about the implications of this amendment, I reiterate this is about balancing the rights of Internet users, Internet businesses and the copyright holder.  The ISPs, as I outlined earlier, are the mere conduit, the mechanism through which information flows.  They act responsibly, as do individual websites, and in the majority of cases do not overtly seek to facilitate copyright theft.  A solution to the problem might be voluntary agreements in place between copyright holders and individual ISPs, hosters and caching companies.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we are doing the bidding of big business because there are as many &mdash; a multitude of &mdash; small Irish copyright holders on this island who have the right to certain protections which are not superior to the other rights I have outlined prior to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="279" />
    <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the various clauses in the statutory instrument.  I want to focus on three issues in response, the first of which is cost.  The Minister of State stated repeatedly the protections exist in European law.  There is a sense this statutory instrument is somewhat vague but the Minister of State has stressed judges will look to European law.  He gave the example of <i>www.boards.ie</i>, which employs two people full time on take-down notices and takes this stuff very seriously.  The view of the team of <i>www.boards.ie</i> is this will force legal costs upon them which will probably force them to shut down.  It is the biggest online community in Ireland, with over 2 million unique Irish users.  Every time they have to go to court they believe it will cost them about &euro;35,000.  They can do that a very small number of times and most of their smaller equivalents cannot do that at all.</P>
      <P>Our proposed additional clauses to the statutory instrument would bring the European protections into Irish law.  Rather than a judge ruling on the basis of Irish law, and <i>www.boards.ie</i> possibly being informed an injunction had been taken and some ISPs were blocking access to <i>www.boards.ie</i>, and <i>www.boards.ie</i> having to spend upwards of &euro;35,000 getting a new ruling citing European law, through the clauses in the statutory instrument we are bringing that into Irish law.  Therefore, by the Minister&rsquo;s own logic, nothing has changed in terms of the additional clauses we have added, but they would give an awful lot of comfort to the people to whom we have spoken.</P>
      <P>The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, a reputable group which includes Google, said the wording of the statutory instrument as published was &ldquo;vague and overly broad.  It creates further business uncertainty for those running or considering establishing Internet services in Ireland&rdquo;.  That is a fairly strong position.</P>
      <P>We accept the Minister of State is not doing the bidding of big business.  However, it is interesting to note the owners of copyright have stated publically they are very happy with the proposed statutory instrument while the intermediaries have stated publically they are deeply unhappy, and the largest Irish online community has stated that this will force it out of business.</P>
      <P>In terms of finding balance, if one side is delighted with it and the other side is horrified by it, and they are all legitimate, it suggests the current statutory instrument does not have that balance.  We have added the additional clauses to strike that balance.  I encourage the Minister to examine them and commit to the House this evening that he will give a detailed response and provide time and a timeframe to debate the clauses for the reasons I have laid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffinFG">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Deputies, I have received thousands of e-mails on this proposed amendment to the copyright Act.  Will the Minister of State give an assurance that foreign direct investment will not be frightened away as a result of this statutory instrument?  That has been the most striking of the concerns raised with me.  Further to Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s comments, <i>www.boards.ie</i> described the implications of this law as akin to Bank of Ireland taking proceedings against National Toll Roads because the bank robber used the M50 as a getaway route.  I understand why people are concerned and perhaps the Minister of State can address that issue.  What notification will be given to people who are suspected of being in breach of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State assured us that the statutory instrument only clarifies the existing law and does not represent a change of policy.  I accept his assurance but we have to bear in mind that the existing law, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, was passed 12 years ago.  The Internet has changed enormously in the intervening period.  As far as I am aware, the only application for an injunction under the 2000 Act was the EMI case.  We are now making it clear that people can apply for an injunction against an Internet service provider.</P>
      <Col N="280" />
      <P>I agree with those who argue that the provisions of the statutory instrument are too vague.  We should not rely on the European Court of Justice, which may change its mind in years to come, or the Irish courts&rsquo; interpretation of European judgments and the e-commerce directive.  As the Parliament of this country, we should be setting out clear guiding principles for the courts through primary legislation along the lines proposed by the Technical Group.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for a considered and thoughtful debate.  Our key belief is that we cannot trample on the rights of individual citizens or businesses.

Copyright is a principle to which this State adheres but I reiterate it is not a superior right for the purposes of this statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s contention.  The mechanism by which <i>www.boards.ie</i> operates is such that if members do anything untoward, a take down notice can be issued to the website.  I am sure <i>www.boards.ie</i> complies with take down notices where illegal activities or defamatory comments are suspected.  Why would that threaten its core business?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Deputy.  People speak about the cost of defence.  Just because one applies for an injunction, the judge will not necessarily grant it.  We must have regard for the rights of individual companies to conduct their business and for citizens to express themselves freely.  Nobody is trampling on those rights.  This statutory instrument restates a position which we already held prior to the Charleton judgment.</P>
      <P>It is important that all the stakeholders sit down with each other to chart a strategy on how this space will operate in the future.  In the context of the disparate nature of the users and businesses that operate in this space, it is incumbent on us to chart a way forward.  I would be delighted to make myself available to facilitate that process.

I have already stated that it is our intention to proceed with the statutory instrument.  The State has been exposed on this issue, which has been ongoing since November 2010, and what we are doing is a proportionate response.  We will not infringe on anybody&rsquo;s right to conduct a business or to free expression through the Internet.</P>

      <P>In regard to the alternative statutory instrument proposed by T.J. McIntyre, I have debated the issue with him in public media and I am not averse to engaging <Col N="281" />with the digital rights community with a view to hammering out a strategy.  However, we have to implement the statutory implement and we are doing so on foot of advice from two Attorneys General.  I have to take account of the sound advice given by an Attorney General.  This legislative measure is being introduced on foot of the legal advice my Department has obtained.  The Office of the Attorney General was asked by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for advice on the implications of the High Court judgment and it has advised that the obligation set out in the directive is clear and unambiguous.  Rights holders must be given a mechanism to apply for an injunction against intermediaries where their intellectual property rights are being breached.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office advised separately that the prudent course was to introduce a regulation to ensure compliance.  That is merely what we are doing.</P>

        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        provide detailed clarification on the appeals mechanism for staffing changes.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The motion before the House on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party clearly outlines our concerns over the adverse effects the changes proposed to the staffing schedule for small schools will cause to many communities throughout the country.  The protection of small rural schools is a critical issue for Fianna F&aacute;il and we believe the 2012 budget unfairly targeted rural communities.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to introduce phased staffing cuts in small schools with fewer than five teachers is a cause of very serious concern in many communities, rural and urban.</P>
      <P>During the course of the past decade there was a very substantial increase in the resources provided to small schools in the form of teacher numbers, teaching support staff and the physical infrastructure, with new or upgraded classrooms and ancillary accommodation.  Those decisions were taken and that investment was made because we see local primary schools as an irreplaceable part of community life.  In our motion we ask the Government to protect the existing network of one, two, three and four teacher schools.</P>
      <P>In the two months or thereabouts since the budget was announced, the cuts being imposed in our schools have rightly become the cause of concern to many school communities.  While many Members on the Government side issued press releases praising the fairness of the budget and how they had protected staffing and schools, the reality has quickly emerged that the exact opposite is the truth.  Core staffing has not been left intact, and pupils, schools and communities most in need have been singled out for cuts.  The programme for Government gave a clear commitment to protect front-line services.  By anyone&rsquo;s definition the classroom teacher provides a very important front-line service.  Cutting these jobs is as clear a broken promise as pledging to reduce fees and then increasing them.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Education and Skills commenced a value for money review of the provision of small primary schools.  As that Minister confirmed at the time and many times subsequently, the review was commissioned with absolutely no commitment to cutting the number of teachers.  The main approach was to find the best way of supporting the schools, and I and many others in this House at that time consistently made the point that small schools should be valued and protected.  The large number of responses to that particular consultation process demonstrated the importance of this network of schools.  Why were decisions with such impact on small schools made in advance of the finalisation of that report?  There has been no consultation with management bodies or unions.  The Government must publish whatever impact analysis has been carried out by the Department on these far-reaching changes.</P>
      <P>Surely all of us in public life should understand the role of small schools in our education system.  It is true that we have an unusually high number of primary schools in proportion to our population.  This is the result of many factors, the most important of which is that our national schools have always played the role of being a focal point in a local community.  Where other countries took the approach of bussing children long distances to meet idealised efficiency standards, we have retained the community-school link as a core feature.  We must continue to retain that link.  Our population dispersal pattern is very different from that of most European countries.  In terms of education standards the evidence is that pupil outcomes in smaller schools keep pace with those of schools with much larger enrolments and specialised support services.  In the broader educational context, having schools which are rooted in their communities helps children to better understand the place where they are growing up.  Vitally, these <Col N="284" />schools help maintain the viability of many rural areas.  Taking away the school in a community takes away the community&rsquo;s heart and future.</P>
      <P>In the decade up to 2005 the population in rural areas showed its first increase since the Famine.  We bucked the trend which was both historical and international.  No one from rural areas doubts that supporting and investing in smaller rural schools has been central to this.  Keeping these schools and upgrading them was not done in the name of administrative efficiency but because the richness and diversity of Irish community life is worth protecting.  In the overall context, the money involved has been a tiny fraction of the State spending but the impact has been very positive and progressive.</P>
      <P>As 47% of the 3,200 primary schools in the State have five teachers or fewer, the huge impact the staffing schedules will have is evident.  Last June the Minister said that in considering any policy change on small schools, the Department would consider a number of wider dimensions other than simply the cost of running small schools.  Our position has always been that it is about increasing the education return to communities from these schools and not about finding ways of rationalising them.  We believe these schools provide value for money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred in this House to small schools mainly having a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than larger schools.  This is not comparing like with like.  Teachers in small schools have pupils of different ages and different grades in their classroom.  It is not true to claim there would be a gradual increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in small schools.  These changes represent a dramatic increase.  For example, a Gaeltacht school will now need 83 pupils instead of 76 pupils to qualify for four teachers this year.  The new retention figures published by the Department are inequitable.  A large school with 12 teachers needs another 28 pupils to become a 13-teacher school.  However, a two-teacher school that wants to become a three-teacher school this September will need an additional 37 pupils, while a three-teacher school looking to become a four-teacher school will need an additional 30 pupils.  Why are small schools punished in comparison with larger schools?  These new retention figures will, in fact, make it more difficult for the smaller schools to expand.</P>
      <P>The advice by the Department to small schools &ldquo;to consider their future&rdquo; and &ldquo;to assess their options for amalgamation&rdquo; is clearly a stark message.  The changes are blunt in nature and the forced cuts are based on numbers alone, without any consideration for the school&rsquo;s ethos, the geography of a particular area or the impact on the community of removing such a key amenity.  These cuts will have a disproportionate and severe impact on minority faith schools such as Church of Ireland schools and also on Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna.  This is also completely at odds with the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to widen patronage in our education system through the forum on patronage and pluralism.  This is going in the exact opposite direction of what the Minister is trying to achieve in the patronage area.  There are 200 Protestant primary schools in the State.  Some 65% of Church of Ireland schools will be affected by the changes announced by the Minister.  There are also serious issues for gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht area.</P>
      <P>This cannot just be about value for money and achieving savings.  Research has shown that children do well in these schools and that the social and emotional development of children in small schools is stronger.  While multi-grade and multi-class teaching has its challenges, there are considerable learning positives to grouping children of different ages and different grades together.  The Department statistics indicate that approximately 40% of all primary school pupils are taught in multi-class situations.  Even in a one-grade class there is always a considerable range of abilities, maturity and needs.  No two children can be considered as being at the same level in all areas.</P>
      <Col N="285" />
      <P Just="Left">The small school provides a sense of belonging where each child is valued for his or her unique qualities.  In the big schools, unfortunately, a pupil can easily be lost in the crowd.  Multi-class teaching brings together children of different ages and development.  While very few studies have been done in Ireland on the efficacy of small schools, the results of the limited number of studies done to date all come to the same conclusions as the international studies.  International research has shown that students taught in multigrade and multiclass situations are on a par academically with those taught in single grade classrooms.  Research has shown that there is no discernible difference in academic performance between multigrade and single grade pupils.  The Ofsted report of recent years demonstrates this clearly.  Research also shows that smaller schools have greater parental involvement.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, as I did during Question Time in the House recently, to provide clarity with regard to the appeals mechanism.  During Question Time I cited cases of schools that will lose teachers because of the retrospective element and the 30 September 2011 enrolment criteria.  This retrospective element will be especially harsh for many schools come this September when they will lose a teacher for one year unless there are changes.  I appeal to the Department and the Minister to change these criteria.</P>
      <P>The Department should also allow schools to amalgamate learning support resource teaching hours rather than have the farcical situation of people needlessly travelling between schools.  Surely there should be local autonomy in respect of the school roster and not centralisation.  The system in place until the recent announcement worked well at local level from an efficiency point of view.  The importance of our small schools must be recognised and the uncertainty created must be removed.  I call on the Government to deal with this quickly and to rescind these retrograde changes to the staffing schedules.  I am sharing my time with Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Charlie McConalogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv">
      <NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this issue.  I wish to begin with some simple statistics.  No doubt the Minister will go into his usual talk about the country being in receivership and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv">
      <NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that in 2006, during the height of the Celtic tiger, the Minister of the day had &euro;7.888 billion to deal with.  Of that, a total of &euro;1.673 billion was spent on primary school salaries.  In 2012, the Minister&rsquo;s gross estimate is larger, at more than &euro;8.62 billion, and the Minister has &euro;2 billion for primary school salaries.  Therefore, the Minister has a large pot to play with and the decisions the Minister has made are those he chose to make because this is the way he wishes to see the future.  The Minister let the cat out of the bag when he issued the document before me on the night of the budget.  It states clearly that the long-cherished dream of the Department of Education and Skills to amalgamate small schools has a champion in the Minister, who has no comprehension of the nature of rural society.</P>
      <P>It is a conscious ploy to use the excuse of money to fulfil a policy that will destroy a good deal of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Before I go into the main issue I wish to outline some of the sneaky cuts.  I understand the Minister changed the rule on sharing learning support and resource teachers.  The sensible thing to do in order to keep travelling down would be to allow schools to add learning support hours and resource teacher hours together and, perhaps, to have one teacher shared between two schools rather than two teachers shared between four schools.  If there were any concerns for the carbon footprint, this represents the most bizarre proposal yet.  There has been a change in the general allocation of learning support hours from being based on the number of pupils in a school to being based on the number of teachers, the <Col N="286" />result of which is to make it harder to keep the teachers and a double whammy effect on learning support hours.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the main issue.  What is the Minister trying to do?  He is trying to hit rural communities, minority religion communities agus na ceantracha Gaeltachta.  For some reason, these have been in the Minister&rsquo;s sights.  At the same time, when one considers the Minister&rsquo;s budget, it appears the schools that escape the cuts are basically the large, advantaged schools throughout the country.  The Minister has preserved and protected these.  To ensure they suffer no cuts, the Minister has decided that rural schools should take the hit.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister is entitled to make his policy and we are entitled to oppose it.  I put it to the Minister that the anger in the rural communities is such that this will not be forgotten.  This is seen by rural communities, for whom I have worked all my adult life, as a direct attack on their viability.  The reality is that the Minister is trying to take small schools including two-teacher schools and make them into one-teacher schools.  We all know that syndrome.  When a school becomes a one-teacher school, the parents choose to send their children to the next two or three-teacher school and the one-teacher school closes.  The idea is that amalgamations are voluntary but it is with a gun at one&rsquo;s back and one is told to walk.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had consulted with any of us who have worked in rural development we could have told him that when one closes the small school, the community withers and dies.  People will tend to live near to where there is a primary school.  Therefore, the Minister is trying to force the closure or death of small communities throughout the country.  If the Minister does not believe me, I will bring him to certain areas and I will show him what happened following the closure of schools in the 1960s and 1970s.  We learned our lesson from that time and we know that where there is no school, there is no community and the community tends to go downhill.</P>
      <P>The reason for doing this is rather bizarre.  If there is a problem with education &mdash; the Minister has considerable problems &mdash; it is in the urban areas where the Minister has put in vast resources.  As a result of spatial planning policies, the Government favours a scenario whereby everyone is urbanised.  Areas of social deprivation then materialise with no value on education in them and where between 10% and 20% of the children get a third level education.  If the Minister does not believe me because he comes from Dublin 4, I will show him parts of Dublin with which I am very familiar.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  I was and I have seen both sides of the world.  I grew up in a privileged part of this city but my children went to school in rural Ireland and I know the success that they and their cohort had from the small schools.  This is exactly the point I was going to make to the Minister.  If I go to the leafy suburbs of south County Dublin, some 70% to 75% of school children might get to third level.  If, however, we go to Cherry Orchard and Ballymun and such areas one would be lucky to get 20% progressing from these areas, having put in vast resources.  However, if one goes to rural Ireland, one finds that it compares well with the top areas in Dublin in respect of access to third level with in excess of 70% of school children getting to third level because of the educational values of the parents in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to kill the successful communities and he does not realise what he is doing.  If the Minister does not realise what he is doing, I beg him to find out because, as I <Col N="287" />have pointed out, rural depopulation follows the closure of the small school.  Anyone not familiar with that syndrome should make themselves familiar with it.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on two other issues.  In this country we have always said that we have treated our minorities in a fair and equitable way.  Like the Minister, I grew up in an area with a large number of people of the Church of Ireland faith and I am absolutely surprised and stunned at this attack on the Church of Ireland community in Ireland.  All the Protestant communities have small schools throughout the country, the largest being the Church of Ireland but there are Presbyterian and other schools as well.  I am surprised at the Minister, who has always said he is open and tolerant, taking the big stick against these schools.</P>

      <P>I commend our education spokesperson on bringing forward this motion, because it is one which goes to the heart of many rural communities across the country.  It is the rural areas this will hit hardest.  What the Minister is doing in his budget is forcing the bulk of the cuts on the schools and pupils who need help most and on those rural areas throughout the country that need additional assistance.</P>
      <P>In defending these cuts over recent weeks, the Minister has often referred to the fact there is inequity in terms of smaller schools having a better pupil-teacher ratio than schools with larger numbers of students.  There is a reason for that, namely that it is more difficult for a teacher and a school with a small number of teachers to ensure students get the support they need.  The Minister and most people may never have attempted to teach three or four classes in one, but it is a difficult job to do.  It is for that reason it is necessary to have enhanced pupil-teacher ratios in smaller schools.  I understand this may not go down well when the Minister sits with the Department of Finance mandarins to assess how the Minister will spread his budget for the year ahead but it is essential that these resources are maintained.  The Minister has looked at this and decided that because it costs more to educate a student and provide a better pupil-teacher ratio in schools and areas where there are smaller numbers of teachers and students but that is no reason to make it policy to go ahead and take the initiatives he is taking.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has said that he does not intend to close down any schools.  I would like to remind him of a response I received from him to a parliamentary question in recent days regarding schools facing into losing teachers next year.  He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The phasing in of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations <Col N="288" />take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What the Minister is saying here is that the objective of his cuts is to force these schools to look at amalgamation and to force them to give up the position they hold so dearly, namely the opportunity to maintain the school they have and to continue to have students educated in their local community.  Yet, the Minister comes out with the headline that he will not close any school.  That is a disingenuous and inaccurate approach.  What underlines and is behind the policy decisions the Minister has made in his budget is a policy that will lead to the closure of schools.</P>
      <P>Along with these cuts, the Minister also proposes changes to rural transport and he is doubling the cost per student for transport to school, despite the fact that many of the Labour Party and Fine Gael backbenchers and candidates in the most recent election made commitments to schools across the country that they would reverse proposed changes in rural transport and not increase the cost of sending pupils to school.  They also promised not to go ahead with changes to the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; school rule with regard to transport nor with changes that are due to come into place in September, whereby siblings of pupils from a family who historically and in recent years attended one school will be forced to attend another school because the one to which they have transport is not the closest to them.  The intention to increase the numbers needed to qualify for transport to school will also have an impact.  It is being made more difficult for people from rural areas to ensure their children are educated in their local school.</P>
      <P>Teachers are afraid to talk openly about the fact that it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to reduce pupil-teacher ratios because by doing so they may be sending out a message to prospective parents in local areas that there is a threat over their school or that pupil-teacher ratios may decrease.  The knock-on effect of that would be that parents intending to send their children to school for the first time, will consider another larger school further away.  This feeds into the Minister&rsquo;s objective.  I see him nodding to say that is exactly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.  By doing this, he is sending the message to parents that this is what he wants to do.  Although the Minister is not coming out and shutting the school today, he is setting in train actions that will achieve his objective and undermine the quality of education provided to students to help them continue to succeed as in the past.</P>
      <P>I would like to show the Minister the importance of the measure he is taking to areas outside of the larger cities and indicate the impact it will have in places like my county of Donegal.  Based on the 2010 enrolment figures, 101 schools out of 178 schools in Donegal could be affected by these changes.  In south Donegal, 14 out of a total of 30 will be affected.  In north Donegal, 37 out of 66 schools will be affected.  In north east Donegal, 17 out of 32 will be affected and in west Donegal, some 33 out of 50 will be affected.  That is the impact these cuts will have in Donegal and other rural areas.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge, as we all do, the difficult budgetary situation facing the Minister and the country, but there are certain things we must prioritise, in particular health and education. <Col N="289" /> However, it seems that with the cuts the Minister is making this year, he is choosing to attack rural areas and rural schools.  By phasing in his cuts over the next number of years, he is setting the tone of what is to come.  I urge him to reconsider and to go back to the drawing board with his proposals.  I urge him, to review this, along with other decisions he has made and along with the review he is doing of DEIS schools.  He should go back and find other ways of dealing with this and ensure that our primary schools and our four-teacher, three-teacher and two-teacher schools in rural areas are protected and that we do not see an erosion of the quality of education under his stewardship.  He should reverse these proposed cuts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend our education spokesperson, Deputy Brendan Smith, for putting forward this motion tonight.  It goes to the heart of every rural community.  Schools right across the country are very concerned with these decisions in respect of four, three and two teacher schools.  It is vitally important that we stand back and look at what these schools have contributed over the generations since education was established in these communities.  Since the 1960s and 1970s, there has always been a determination shown by the Department of Education and Skills to amalgamate schools, and it must be said that this policy has failed.  Across the US, the UK and places where amalgamation policies have been pursued, reports have shown that these policies were wrong.  The urbanisation of society is causing a lot more harm than good.</P>
      
      <P>There are communities across the country that are concerned about the future of their schools, which have provided excellent education for generations of people.  If we look at the people who have come into the public service and across the spectrum who have done very well, they often have come from these schools.  The budget has made an attempt at attacking them and the fundamentals of what they have.  Over the last number of weeks, many schools in my own constituency have been in contact with us about how the budget will affect them, not just in September 2012, but in September 2013, 2014 and beyond, which will affect the decisions they make about the schools to which they send their children.  This goes back to the identity of children as they grow up in smaller rural communities.  Instead of taking the facility from them, we should be further encouraging facilities.</P>
      <P>The nonsense of what is being proposed is having a detrimental effect in a number of schools.  Knocknagree national school in my own area had the numbers for four teachers on 30 September 2011, but because of the change in the budget, it will now be affected by a reduction of one teacher on 30 September 2012.  Due to the projected enrolments in that community and the parish records and the information available to the school, we know that it will have the numbers for a four-teacher school in September 2013.  That is a huge anomaly.  The school will be losing a teacher for a particular year.  That teacher will have been working in the school and will have built up a relationship with the local stakeholders in the school system but due to the decision by the Minster in the budget and due to the decision by the Department, this school will lose out.  Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister and his officials to look at that case.  According to the school&rsquo;s own projections, there will be 36 in one classroom with three different classes, and that is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Many more school representatives, such as those of Milford and Lismire, have been in contact with me about how these changes will affect them.  They have been in contact with the prospective parents in their communities and these parents are now asking how will they be affected in September 2012, 2013, 2014 and beyond.  The future of these schools is worrying the school authorities, the parents and the wider community.  I do not know whether the Minister understands the depth of feeling that is within rural communities about the identity that their schools give them.  We have seen what urbanisation across the world has cost society in the long term, not just in education, but also in justice and in other things.  The rural communities provide an excellent prototype to follow, and we should be supporting them.  I ask the Minister <Col N="290" />to look at the nonsense that has caused a school to lose a teacher due to the new rules, even though the numbers were there on 30 September and they will be there again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2">
      <NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Brendan Smith for putting down this motion and for giving us an opportunity to make a case on behalf of the smaller schools across the country.  The Minister for Education and Skills has managed to upset all strands of education in the last month, such as DEIS schools, career guidance teachers and now primary schools.  Many meetings have been held around the country, including in my own county where parents are up in arms about the decisions being taken by the Minister.  I have attended many school openings over the last few years and I hope that when new schools are opened in Wexford in future, the Minister will be able to come and get involved.  At the moment, there is alarm and concern about his actions in respect of the smaller primary schools.</P>
      <P>We have to recognise that the primary schools are at the heart of the local community.  They are the heartbeat of a parish.  They are usually the feeder for the local GAA club, soccer club, youth clubs and all other aspects of community living.  Long before I got involved in politics I saw schools being amalgamated and the village and community that lost the school lost their identity and their soul.  It is very important that the Minister recognises that the school is very much the focal point for the community.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister claims that small schools mainly have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than larger schools, but he is not comparing like with like.  Teachers in small schools have pupils of all different ages and ability in their classroom.  Small schools have been invited by the Department of Education and Skills to consider their future and assess their options for amalgamation.  When the heavy-handed Department asks the small primary schools to consider their future, does that mean that they will be forced to close or forced to amalgamate?  We have often seen in the past that when the Department decides to do something, its heavy hand is usually imposed and the Department gets its way.  The Minister must clarify whether there will be forced amalgamations or whether it will happen by agreement.  It should not happen at all.  According to groups like the INTO and the IPPN, the idea seems to be to force smaller schools to amalgamate or close by making it more and more difficult for these schools to teach larger groups, with fewer teachers having to teach more classes.</P>
      <P>I was involved, along with other Deputies from Wexford, including the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the development of a small school in Ballyoughter in Gorey.  Around &euro;900,000 was spent two years ago on a small school in the area.  The people involved raised money, the Department gave them money, and they built a new school, which has a small number of students.  Is the Minister for Education and Skills going to force that school to amalgamate with Ballycanew, Camolin or some other adjoining parish?  If that happens, we will have a &euro;900,000 school lying idle in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister must step back from the decisions he is considering in this whole area.  They have been announced without debate, consultation or agreement.  If the crowds turning up to meetings around the country are anything to go by, then the Minister is in for a major fight on his hands.  People want to retain schools in their own community as the heartbeat of the parish.  It is important that the Minister recognises the importance of such schools and that he steps back from the proposals he has put forward in the last few weeks.</P>

      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        public services, including schools, must continue to be an important part of the social fabric of rural communities;</P>
      <P LI="1">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        notes that:</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        there are 3,200 primary schools across Ireland, of which over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and have much higher average class sizes than the small primary schools;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        small schools receive much more favourable capitation and other grant payments due to the practice of minimum payments: for example, schools receive a minimum capitation payment based on a 60 pupil enrolment, meaning that a school with 12 pupils receives the same capitation payment as a school with 60 pupils, in addition to the fact that construction costs per pupil for capital projects are much higher in small schools than in larger schools;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        at present, a two-teacher school with 12 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for 6 pupils, while in contrast, a typical ten-teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        a value for money review on small primary schools is currently being finalised by the Department of Education and Skills, submissions for which, were invited from the public as part of a public consultation process during 2011 and a large number of responses were received;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        while the threshold for additional teachers in small schools will rise, a small school will still receive a second teacher with 14 pupils, a third teacher with 51 pupils and a fourth teacher with 83 pupils in September 2012; and</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        as a result of these changes the average class sizes in small schools will still be as low as 7:1 in a two-teacher school, 17:1 in a three-teacher school and 20.75:1 in a four-teacher school in September 2012;</P>

      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        it is hoped that the three-year phasing in of this measure will allow communities the opportunity to debate the possibility of amalgamations or clustering arrangements within their communities;</P>
      <P LI="2">
        <Miles com="mdash66" />
        
        if amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department of Education and Skills; and</P>

        the value for money review is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews; and</P>

      <P FLI="0">I will share time with Deputies Colm Keaveney and Jim Daly.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise the overall financial and budgetary context in which Ireland is operating.  We are relying on funding being provided through the EU-IMF programme of support for the provision of our day-to-day public services, including funding for our education system, as nobody else is willing to lend Ireland money at an affordable interest rate.  It is also worth reminding the House that the extraordinarily difficult position in which we find ourselves has arisen from the catastrophic mistake by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to inextricably link sovereign debt, the debt of this Republic, with the debts of bankers and speculators when it introduced, in this Chamber, the ill fated bank guarantee in September 2008.</P>

      <P>We would not be debating this or other cuts in public expenditure if the Fianna F&aacute;il Party had lived up to its responsibilities in government.  Years of profligate, irresponsible spending funded through debt and borrowing were matched by economic policies which cost the economy its competitiveness and reputation as a good place to do business.  In 1997, when the coalition left government, Ireland had the most competitive economy in Europe.  Look at where we are today.  Everything that was done under the Fianna F&aacute;il Government was subsumed to the higher aim of a cynical strategy geared at winning elections, at which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was very successful.

As a former Minister for Education, the party&rsquo;s current leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is aware that almost 80% of my budget is expended on pay and pensions.

      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What members of the public would like to hear from Fianna F&aacute;il is where it suggests savings in jobs and expenditure can be made in education.  What teaching posts would it suppress, what grants would it reduce or abolish and what other measures would it take?  It cannot pretend it does not have the basic data on which to base its recommendations, as it was long enough in government to know how the education system is staffed and funded.  I await its recommendations with interest but without expectations.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it is essential that we close the funding gap between what we take in from taxation and what we spend on our day-to-day services.  Let us get our heads around the figures, which I must repeatedly put up on the blackboard for some slow learners to understand.  This year, the gap between income and expenditure will amount to &euro;18 billion, which is almost double the entire budget for the Department of Education and Skills.  Last December&rsquo;s budget will, it is hoped, close the gap by a further &euro;3.8 billion and reduce our deficit to 8.6% of GDP by the end of the year.  To meet the conditions of the memorandum of understanding, which the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government placed around the neck of this Republic, we must reduce the 8.6% GDP deficit to 3% by 2015.  Unless we get a bounce in economic growth through a recovery in the euro and exports, we will face a difficult budget next year and in 2014, regardless of which parties are in government.  We cannot be under any illusion about the serious position in which we find ourselves.  As I have stated on many occasions, our finances must be put on a sustainable footing in order that we can re-enter the financial markets to continue to fund our public services and restore our country&rsquo;s economic and social well-being.</P>
      <Col N="294" />
      <P>Achieving savings in my Department&rsquo;s budget has required very difficult decisions to be made, particularly at a time when the school-going population is increasing.  We want to be as fair as possible in making the required decisions.  A key part of our overall budgetary strategy is a requirement under the employment control framework to reduce the public sector payroll.  Reductions in the public service pay bill and staffing numbers will continue to play a part in expenditure consolidation.  Given that one third of all public sector employees work in the education sector, it is simply not possible to completely exempt staffing levels in education from the Government&rsquo;s need to reduce expenditure.</P>
      <P>The budget which was agreed in December was challenging for all of us.  We made difficult decisions and, as I intimated, further difficult budgets will be introduced next year and the year thereafter.  However, there is also hope.  Only last week, the National Treasury Management Agency successfully returned to the bond market ahead of time, albeit temporarily.  This is the first sign that markets believe we will be able to stand on our own two feet by the end of the programme.  We need to build on this as a Government and to continue working to get people back to work, protect those who cannot afford to pay their debts and build upon all of the best features of our education system.</P>
      <P>Let me address the issue of rural communities.  I have heard much comment in recent weeks suggesting there is an urban-rural divide in Irish politics and the budgetary measures enacted by this Government amount to an attack on rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>This little island of ours, with its relatively small population, has been riven by divisions of one kind or another for the past 200 to 300 years.  We do not need a new, manufactured and artificial division.</P>
      <P>I may represent an urban constituency but nobody could fail to appreciate the importance of rural communities to our society.  Small rural communities are a cornerstone of our heritage and it is essential that modern Ireland continues to recognise their importance.  In recent years they have been threatened, not by overt political action but the ever increasing trend towards urbanisation on all five Continents.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is no longer our dominant industry, although I am pleased to note it is thriving again.</P>

      <P>In many rural communities, the school, Protestant and Catholic churches, GAA club and local shop are the institutions on and around which the community is built.  These are foundations we must seek to protect.  However, the continuing trend towards urbanisation continues to pose a threat to these foundations and it is one that we cannot ignore.  Between 1963 and 1973, two revered leaders of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Se&aacute;n Lemass and, subsequently, Jack Lynch, closed 1,000 one and two teacher schools in rural areas.  In 1992, the then Minister for Education, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, had a policy to amalgamate all schools with four teachers or fewer.  We have been here before and the Deputies opposite were Members of this House at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In many communities the urbanisation trend has already resulted in the closure of the rural shop or pub.  We must have a genuine conversation about the role that can be played by rural schools and how we can reshape our school system to ensure these communities are supported and maintained.  Let us have this debate in the context of the second <Col N="295" />decade of the 21st century.  Let us examine what is taking place across the water or north of the Border where the Minister for Education, Mr. John O&rsquo;Dowd of Sinn F&eacute;in, is contemplating closing upwards of 100 schools because of rural depopulation.  Last Monday week, I participated in a conference with the chief inspectors of schools in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Communities in all four jurisdictions, as well as in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, must try to square the circle of maintaining rural communities in the modern age by delivering education and recognising the changes that are taking place.</P>
      <P>We must look at the reality of what is happening.  Unlike the King Lear of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, we cannot turn to the tide of urbanisation and say it is not coming in.  Let us see how we can deal with it and do the sort of things he wants to do.</P>
      <P>This debate gives me an opportunity to state categorically that this measure &mdash; the change in the pupil-teacher ratio &mdash; is not about closing schools, which I have acknowledged play an important part in our communities, particularly in rural areas.  In the budget, there was no increase in the general average of the pupil-teacher ratio of 28:1 in our primary schools, something for which many people had called.  However, the budget included a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  The only thing that is changing for small schools is that their average class sizes will no longer be as advantageous as they have been in the past due to the phased increases in the pupil thresholds in the staffing schedule.</P>
      <P>The existing staffing appeals process will be accessible to small schools, in particular those schools which are projecting increased enrolments that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The details on how the appeals system will operate will be made clear as part of my Department&rsquo;s forthcoming circular.  It will issue shortly to all schools on the staffing arrangements for the 2012-13 school year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is not sustainable &mdash; the Deputies opposite know this very well no matter what part of rural or urban Ireland in which they live &mdash; for the Department of Education and Skills to continue to provide a second classroom teacher to a school that has 12 pupils.  Can anyone honestly say that we can afford to have a staffing schedule threshold that provides for a full-time classroom teacher with an average of as low as six pupils per classroom?  That is a better pupil-teacher ratio than for children with special needs in special schools.  Is that what the Deputies opposite are defending?  Of course, some teachers in these small schools will call for these exceptionally favourable arrangements to continue but how fair is this to the taxpayer or, indeed, to their teaching colleagues in the same union and in medium to larger schools, some of whom must teach 30 or more pupils in their classrooms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even when all of the phased increases are implemented, the threshold for a second teacher at 20 pupils &mdash; that is 1:10 if one evens it out &mdash; will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of the second teacher in rural schools prior to the late 1990s.  The extremely favourable staffing provision for small schools was put in place when resources were plentiful and at a time of demographic dividend when enrolments were falling.  This is no longer possible given our budgetary constraints and rapidly rising school population which, in itself, is a good thing.</P>
      <P>I know that no school likes to lose a teacher and that the INTO and teachers like small classes.  However, it is wrong for a desire to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in teacher numbers and class sizes to result in anxiety in local communities over the future of their schools.  Let me say it loud and clear again to Deputy McConalogue and the other Deputies opposite that this measure is not about closing small schools.  When the staffing schedule operated on much higher levels in the 1990s, we did not have a plethora of small schools closing.</P>
      <Col N="296" />
      <P>There are situations where schools might of their own choosing decide to amalgamate, as many have done in the past with good outcomes.  I would like to encourage communities to have conversations about whether this is possible or, indeed, appropriate.  The changes announced in the budget are being phased in over three years to allow for those measured and timely conversations.  The Department will be available to engage with all schools and communities which wish to make proposals about potential amalgamations or clustering arrangements between schools.</P>

      <P>Last Friday, speaking at the Irish Primary Principals Network Conference, I undertook to enter into discussions with it about international research and possible 21st century options for small rural schools which exist in different countries and situations.</P>
      <P>Small schools close but that is because of a loss of pupils.  Small primary schools which have had to face closure in recent years were those which were no longer viable due to falling enrolments.  The enrolment in such schools had typically fallen below an average of &mdash; wait for it &mdash; eight pupils for two consecutive school years.  That is the level to which one had to go before the school had to close.  School communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure of their local school.  If any school community thinks otherwise, my Department will engage with the school patron and board of management on the issue and address any concerns they have.</P>
      <P>When speaking last week at the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network annual conference, I made clear to it that the budget measure on small schools will be proceeding as planned.  The measure will stand but the Department is open to considering any practical and workable proposals that will bring about greater efficiencies in the management and governance arrangements for small schools.  The Department will engage with the relevant stakeholders on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that a value for money review on small primary schools is currently under way in the Department.  This covers approximately 600 schools which have 50 pupils or less &mdash; virtually one third of the total number of schools we have.</P>

      <P>It is part of the normal processes undertaken by all Departments on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews.  As the report was initiated by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, I trust the party will not now respond by creating fear among communities about a process it initiated.  I expect that the report of the review should be available to me in the next eight weeks.  When it is available, it will be published and considered by all of us.  If the Deputies like, we can have a debate about it in this House.</P>
      <P>Among the issues which will be taken into account in that debate are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities. <Col N="297" /> These are problems which are not unique to Ireland.  They are being faced by our neighbours in the North and across the water on the island of Britain.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  Public consultations were conducted as part of the review in order to obtain the views of stakeholders.  A very large response was received and a common theme from the submissions from the public on the review was the important role which we, on this side of the House, recognise rural schools play in the social fabric of rural communities.  This is something of which we are all fully aware.</P>
      <P>The value for money review is simply about evaluating all the facts to inform future policy in this area.  Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  However, it is important that staffing levels in our small schools are set at an affordable and sustainable level, in particular in these very difficult and challenging times.</P>
      <P>I am sure many Deputies have fond memories of their own time in small schools when class sizes were much larger.  I suggest they are more likely to remember the name of their school principal or teacher and the quality of education they provided rather than the number of pupils who sat beside them in the classroom.  When the review is published, I intend to lay it before the Houses to give Deputies and Senators an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Labour Party, building and protecting our public services has always been one of our core beliefs.  However, we also have to ensure that our public services are affordable and sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet the needs of Ireland in the second decade of the 21st century.  In essence, we have to be able to achieve more with less, which every household in the country is currently battling to do.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to achieving the necessary savings in public spending required by reducing the overall number of public servants.  That means improving our health system with fewer nurses and doctors, maintaining our infrastructure with fewer engineers, and educating our children with fewer teachers.  At a time of great strain on our public finances, we have to ensure that the valuable but limited resources available to the education system are used in the best possible way.  As we have stated in the amendment to the motion, the Government is trying, as best as possible, to protect front line services in the education sector at a time of rapidly rising enrolments.</P>
      <P>I reject the sensationalist claims contained in the Opposition motion.  I also reject the sensationalist noises that are coming from certain meetings around the country where facts are not part of the discourse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Jim Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened intently to many parents in my own constituency who have serious fears about this measure.  I understand that this is a progressive development in many instances, but there are situations where a &ldquo;one cap fits all&rdquo; approach will unfairly affect some isolated rural communities.  To this end, I have already requested from the Minister that a <Col N="298" />provision be entered into school staffing appeals to accommodate exceptional cases, such as a school in my own constituency in Kilcrohane, County Cork, which if reduced to a one-teacher school would close and require a daily commute in excess of 28 miles.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation therefore that the staffing appeals schedule will examine exceptional cases that will be affected.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the need for an appeals mechanism to avoid excessive hardship for a limited number of schools, I welcome the initiative announced, based on the following.  In an ideal world, any classroom should have no more than two classes in it.  That requires a minimum of four teachers, which is for good teaching and good learning.</P>
      <P>The teaching of special needs children is close to my own heart.  In this difficult budget, I commend the Minister for protecting special needs resources.  Time is wasted when special needs teachers must traverse the countryside from one small school to another, during a limited number of hours.  Time would not be wasted if schools came together to consolidate their resources.</P>

      <P>If Deputies listened, they might learn something.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent budget, a principal can now teach resources and special needs.  That measure is welcome for teachers in small schools who teach resources one-on-one and also have to do administration.  It works in larger schools with adequate staff numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimDaly">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Jim Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as a bad or good school but there are weaker or better teachers.  A small school with a weak teacher will result in having such a teacher for four years or the equivalent of half the primary school cycle.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1966, an OECD report entitled &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; challenged the feasibility of one and two-teacher schools in Ireland, citing their high cost per pupil, and the perceived shortcomings in educational resources and outcomes.  In 1991, the OECD encouraged the amalgamation of schools, so as to have no fewer than four teachers in any school for good learning and teaching.</P>
      <P>I have studied the inter-school report prepared on small schools by Alan Sigworth.  He referred to school clustering standing out as the major innovation in the provision of in-service education and school development in sparsely populated areas.  This offers a chance to rural communities to consolidate what they have going for them in rural education.  The reality in many parishes is that two, three or four schools are competing for resources and students, while enrolment numbers are being forced down by demographics.  They will eventually all close over a five to ten-year period.  This is a chance for them to consolidate and ensure the future of education in rural Ireland.  My desire is to see a parish-based board of management taking a strategic long-term look at the future educational needs of the parish, as opposed to having four separate school boards of management all looking inward instead of outwards to the future.</P>
      <P>A recent study I undertook of enrolment trends in parishes in my constituency showed that since 1990 there has been very little change in the number of pupils attending primary schools.  However, millions of euro have been spent on extensions and pre-fabs, while empty classrooms remain in many schools.</P>
      <P>I largely support this proposal and accept that, while not ideal, it is the lesser of the evils involved.  I welcome the fact that special needs resources have not been reduced in the coming <Col N="299" />year.  When it comes to saving money in an education system that has 80% of its budget protected by the Croke Park agreement, I note with great suspicion the frenzied efforts of a minority of teachers to turn this issue into a protest, while refusing to acknowledge that the proposal will save &euro;14 million.  This is a paltry sum compared to the potential savings of &euro;42 million over the next two years if pay increases to teachers were to be paused.  There is a blatant hypocrisy on the part of a minority of teachers, so I ask them to fess up and deal with the reality.</P>

I now appreciate that the comments he made that night were well informed, based on his contribution to a Green Paper when he was first elected in 1992.  Entitled &ldquo;Education in a Changing World&rdquo;, it proposed Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s objective to ensure that the smallest number of teachers in a rural school would be four.

      <P>It can also be said with some justification that the current Minister for Finance and the Irish people face a greater challenge in many respects than that faced by the first Minister for Finance in this country.  I am sure that the thinking and listening Minister for Education and Skills would have wished for better times.  His vision for education could have been realised in full, but none of us gets to choose the times we live in or the external challenge we must face.  Instead, we must face the test that time presents us with, using courage, honesty and a calm rational approach.  We should not engage in empty rhetoric on the rural schools issue.</P>
      <P>The education budget, which represents around 17% of current Government expenditure, is a significant proportion of our revenue.  To put it in context, at over &euro;8 billion, it is the equivalent of under half the gap between current Government expenditure and revenue.  Over the course of the next three years, we will see posts lost in rural schools.  I welcome Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s conversion to the protection of both education and health.  In the last year of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government, it had dismissed more HSE staff than will be lost through attrition in the next five years in rural schools.  In its last year in government, Fianna F&aacute;il fired 500 health workers in HSE west.</P>

However, pay makes up 80% of the total spend in education so cuts have to be found somewhere.  The INTO is in danger of playing into the hands of Fianna F&aacute;il, which cut 15% of its members&rsquo; pay in the past, by seeming to refuse to engage constructively in a discussion on how to manage the current need to cut expenditure while ensuring that the quality of our education is not affected.

As a father of three school-going children, and as someone from a rural area, I am sensitive to the decisions that are taken with regard to small schools.  A calm, rational debate is needed, examining all options, including some in the Fianna F&aacute;il policy of 1992, such as amalgamations, the idea of shared services and the idea of super principals across a range of schools, and the idea that schools could collectively purchase in order to get a better outcome for the children.

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that many of the budget decisions being forced on schools will have far-reaching implications for the Irish education sector.  The Government sought to impose austerity measures and to disregard the effects this will have on children and their futures.  The Minister and his Government colleagues have made political choices that include paying billions of euros into zombie banks and budget choices that have led to the targeting of some of this State&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens.  The decision to cut resources from DEIS schools; the loss of school guidance counsellors and changes to the staffing schedules in one, two, three and four-teacher schools are some of these choices.  They come at a time when rural communities are trying to absorb the loss of young people through mass immigration, the loss of community halls, clubs, post offices and Garda stations as well as village shops, public houses and other small businesses.</P>
      <P>In the rush to reduce budgets, the quality of our children&rsquo;s education is being greatly compromised and the views of teachers, communities and parents largely ignored.  The OECD, as far back as 1991, acknowledged the importance of small schools in ensuring the sustainability and regeneration of rural Ireland.  One of its key conclusions was that educational quality not school size should be the main criterion for rationalisation.  In the mid-1960s, a sustained amalgamation policy was implemented by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  During a seven-year period, the number of one and two-teacher schools was reduced by approximately 1,100.  The decline of many rural communities was blamed on the policy of forced school amalgamations and closures.  This Government now stands on the brink of replicating that policy.</P>
      <Col N="301" />
      <P>The 2009 report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes made several recommendations that included the amalgamations of 659 schools with fewer than 50 pupils, eliminating 300 teaching posts.  The amalgamations of 851 schools in the 50-100 pupil category was also on the table, which would result in an estimated loss of 200 teaching posts.  The conclusions reached in the report disregarded the established criteria for amalgamation including the educational needs of the children, the rights of parents and the adverse effects on the cultural, social and demographic life of small communities.</P>
      <P>Collectively, we are urging the Government to take a more holistic approach to this issue.  Alternatives to amalgamating and closing schools must be considered.  These should include examining ways of repopulating existing schools rather than constantly expanding overcrowded larger schools, where children are often taught in unsuitable or temporary accommodation.  Many rural schools are situated in isolated areas and are far apart.  Budget changes will force children to travel longer distances when hard-pressed families have seen transport costs double in the past year.</P>
      <P>The Government has handed down a decree that will force some schools to close or amalgamate.  What provision has been made to facilitate this change in strategy?  Have plans been put in place to provide new buildings?  Have potential sites been identified?  Are sections of the Department talking to each other on this point?</P>

      <P>That is a major worry.  Will suitable buildings be provided if there is an agreement between schools to amalgamate?  It does not seem to be in the programme and it needs to be done.  There has not been joined-up thinking between the branches of the Department with the responsibility for ensuring schools have the capacity to join together.  How will existing schools cope with increased classroom sizes and an influx of additional pupils?</P>
      <P>The budget reality is that the discretionary ratio for Gaeltacht schools is gone.  This will mean the minimum number of pupils required for a fourth teacher goes from 81 to 83.  In Gaeltacht areas, where the minimum was 76 pupils, schools now need 83 pupils to qualify for a fourth teacher.  This increases to 86 by 2014 for all schools, meaning the increase in Gaeltacht areas will be ten pupils compared to five pupils in other areas.  I share the concerns of other speakers about minority denominations.  They need to be treated with particular sensitivity, particularly in respect of staffing posts and proposed amalgamations.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose amalgamations, particularly if they are carried out with the express wishes of the school community.  There are examples of successful mergers that improved the school environment for pupils and enhanced their educational attainment.  Value for money cannot be the primary consideration that influences policy.  The financial costs associated with providing a network of accessible schools should be carried out in conjunction with improving existing community facilities and as part of a strategy to enhance the social fabric of rural areas.  This is particularly important when we consider the amount of State resources that have already been invested upgrading rural schools.</P>
      <P>Other options need to be considered, including the clustering of small schools.  Whole school evaluation reports provide compelling evidence that many small schools throughout the country meet the needs of students.  Reports frequently refer to the family-like nature of support for pupils in small schools, with many described as effective in facilitating the development of pupils&rsquo; self-confidence and self-belief.  A further vindication of small schools is the regular reference to the high standards of teaching and learning in the curriculum.  Comments such as &ldquo;very good quality learning experiences&rdquo;, &ldquo;high standards are reached in many areas of the curriculum, particularly in English and Mathematics&rdquo; and &ldquo;excellent use is made of ICT&rdquo; are typical of the reports.</P>
      <Col N="302" />
      <P>The vast majority of small schools are in very good condition because local communities take pride in their upkeep.  Other studies indicate that small schools embrace reform agendas more quickly than big schools because they are, by their nature, less bureaucratic.  Recent whole school evaluation reports frequently praise the special education and learning support provision in small schools.  They highlight the high standard of care and attention that is provided to pupils with learning difficulties and special educational needs.  This could be lost if small schools are forced to close and amalgamate.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to recognise the importance of small schools in rural Ireland.  Any viability assessment must have a greater remit than just short-term savings.  Financial concerns, taken in isolation, are no justification for closing small schools and the Government needs to examine the adverse impact on the child who is forced to travel to a different environment.  The importance of rural schools in maintaining community cohesion and the role they play in the preservation of local history, culture and folklore must be also considered.  Every euro cut from the education budget reduces a child&rsquo;s prospects, harms his or her future life chances and jeopardises this country&rsquo;s chance of recovery.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and contributions from some of his Government colleagues.  I heard them slag the proposers of the motion, Fianna F&aacute;il, argue about party politics and warn the INTO not to give into the clutches of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I did not hear them talk about children.  There has been a lot of focus on teachers who will lose their positions in school as a result&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Allow me to finish.  There has been a lot of focus on the teachers who will lose their positions as a result of the changes introduced by the Minister.  I will declare my interest.  My wife is one of the teachers who will lose her position.  The Minister is correct.  No teacher will lose his or her job. The new recruits from Marino and St. Pat&rsquo;s will not be able to get a job as a result of what the Minister decision. </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I want to speak about the many children throughout rural Ireland who will be most disadvantaged because of the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  I do not want to focus on the slagging matches between the political parties about what this or that Government proposed to do.  We need to focus on children&rsquo;s futures.  I have two young boys in junior and senior infants in primary school.  I hope to have other children who will follow them.  Their school is fantastic.  For ten years it was run down and on the schools building programme.  Last year it got a &euro;1.3 million injection.  In September a closed sign will go on one of the newly refurbished state-of-the-art classrooms because the number of teachers will be reduced from four to three.  There are many other similar schools.</P>
      <P>I could tell the House about investments in schools in the Donegal Gaeltacht and other areas which have meant additional classrooms being built, only to have them close next September.  This is about the future of children.  In his speech to Minister said the only thing changing for small schools is that their average class sizes will no longer be as advantageous as they have been in the past.  That is not true.  My son and the sons and daughters of many other mothers and fathers will be in larger classrooms and have multiple classes as a result of the changes.  It is not just about advantageous numbers.</P>
      <P>Under the changes to the staffing schedule, by 2014 the Minister wants a two teacher school to have 28 pupils in each classroom.  The figures for retention will be a total of 56, a class of 28 class and a class of 27.  The teacher will have to stand up every day before 28 children, including those in junior infants, senior infants, first-class and second class, try to teach a jam-<Col N="303" />packed curriculum and hope the children will have the same opportunities as others.  This is wrong.  In a three teacher school, two classes will be made up of 28 pupils and one of 29.  In my constituency 31 out of 42 primary schools will be adversely affected by the changes proposed by the Minister.  It is not just teachers who will lose their positions, children will also lose the 0.2% learning support that has been allocated.</P>
      
      <P>The Labour Party said it had to make these cuts because of budgetary constraints.  I, more than most, know the difficulties this country faces in making a saving of &euro;15 million over a full year.  There are other ways to make savings.   Every year &euro;15 million leaves the State and goes to the European space programme to send people to the moon.  I would rather we allowed our children to attend rural schools.  It would be money more wisely spent and it would allow teachers to do what they are educated to do, namely, provide education for our young people to build the knowledge economy and help kickstart the economy.</P>
      <P>
        The Minister asked for a conversation.  The previous Minister, Mary Coughlan, started the review of small rural schools but the Minister has not waited for it.  He has shown complete disrespect and pre-empted it.  He makes no bones about the fact he wants to see small rural schools amalgamate.  There are reasons small rural  schools will close, such as a lack of pupils or shifting demographics which is the normal course.  The Minister should not introduce policies that force small rural schools to consider amalgamation.  He should be nurturing children and education.</P>
      <P>
        These policies are regrettable.  The Minister and his party have a proud track record &mdash; I use the term &ldquo;record&rdquo; very carefully because the decisions they have implemented in this budget are disastrous &mdash; in education in the past.  The Minister is rolling back on the DEIS proposals.  What the Minister is doing to rural schools is wrong and I ask him to reconsider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister said in his speech about the reality of the situation he inherited.  He has discussed savings.  The previous Government had two schemes which, in the minds of many teachers, were a complete waste of money.  One is the &euro;5.6 million that went into setting up the Teaching Council which teachers did not want and the other was the money wasted on the supervision and substitution scheme. </P>
      <P>Education is not being well served in the budget.  DEIS schools were mentioned and the Minister acknowledged certain mistakes in that regard.  There are issues with guidance counsellors, postgraduate students and now small schools.  It is a particular issue for rural areas but there are also small schools in urban areas.  It is retrograde to target small schools because they have been progressive in providing an excellent education.</P>
      <P>There is a spread of population issue for many schools located in rural areas, particularly on the islands, and they cannot be penalised for that.  While they tend to have a better pupil teacher ratio, that has to be balanced with the spread and challenge posed by one teacher teaching varying ages in one classroom.  I am all for change if what is in place is not working but what is happening in schools works, and one sees that from the school evaluations and websites.  Some are gaelscoileanna and others are schools in Gaeltacht areas, others are island Gaeltacht schools.   We are also talking about undermining the work they do in promoting the Irish language and continuing its use.</P>
      <P>If the population in an island school is very small, one teacher could be teaching a class with an age range from four years to 12 or 13 years.  What was the extent of the consultation with parents and teachers in those schools?  Where is the proof that closing them would save money?  The small schools value for money review was mentioned.  At what stage is that and why did the Minister not wait for it to be published before these decisions were made?</P>
      <Col N="304" />
      <P>Small schools in the Gaeltacht and on the islands are more than schools, they are central to the community and to ensuring community life will continue.  The amendment states this has to do with the allocation of teaching posts and is not a measure to close small schools.  Reducing the number of teachers will mean small schools will not be viable and will close.  If a school in a community is closed, it will affect more than just the school because schools are central to community life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not be debating these cuts if the Labour Party and Fine Gael had honoured their election commitments.  It is important to recall those commitments.  They were going to burn the bondholders, not another red cent would be given to the banks, it would be Labour&rsquo;s way not Frankfurt&rsquo;s way and the weak and vulnerable would be protected.  The Government robbed the clothes from Fianna F&aacute;il and are now implementing austerity policies which were also implemented by the previous Government. </P>
      <P>These cuts are wrong and counter-productive.  There is huge opposition to them throughout the country.  There are meetings up and down the country.  The cuts predominantly affect small rural schools but also affect minority faith schools, such as Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Gaeltacht schools.  As a previous speaker said, they also affect some schools in urban areas.</P>
      <P>Every day the media and our politicians tell us education is key to our social and economic future.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to target young students in their formative years, and it will undermine their education for the rest of their lives.  These schools are at the heart of local communities and are at the centre of all local activities, and this is an attack on rural Ireland.  These proposals are proposals for the closure of small schools.  Taken together with the changes in the school transport system, they mean the forced amalgamation of schools and therefore, the closure of schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister shows a total lack of understanding of small schools and multi-class teaching.  It is not the same as single class schools with sub-groups.  It involves two, three and four class levels, with ages and maturity levels spanning up to four years in one classroom.  Within those four year levels there are sub-groups requiring extra attention.  The pupil-teacher ratio is not advantageous.  It is based on the reality of multi-class teaching and learning.</P>
      <P>Every time the Minister speaks on this issue &mdash; he did it again tonight &mdash; he picks out the small schools with 12 pupils and two teachers.  This is totally misleading as he well knows.  There are very few of these schools.  Most schools that will lose teaching posts are the three teacher schools with 40-50 pupils and four teacher schools with 70-80 pupils.</P>
      <P>There are alternatives.  We can stop paying the bondholders and we can introduce a wealth tax.</P>

        <P>In 2011, my Department provided &euro;650,000 through a &ldquo;Structures at Risk Fund&rdquo; to assist with works to safeguard structures, both in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010. This fund was administered by local authorities. This funding was focused primarily on those protected structures most at risk.</P>
        <P>&euro;105,000 in funding was also provided through the National Monuments Service of my Department for rescue excavations at archaeological sites under immediate threat of damage and destruction.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department provided capital assistance of &euro;1.25 million to the Office of Public Works to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic properties and national monuments in State care. This included work on such iconic projects as the National Botanic Gardens and Cormac&rsquo;s Chapel on the Rock of Cashel, both major tourist attractions.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds infrastructural developments in Ireland&rsquo;s National Parks and Reserves. These are key assets in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism infrastructure. In this regard, my Department has received a grant of &euro;5.2 million from F&aacute;ilte Ireland to restore Killarney House in Kerry as a visitor centre and gateway to Ireland&rsquo;s most popular national park. Work commenced on the House in 2011.</P>

        <P>The Implementation Committee established last July to examine the feasibility of the implementation of the recommendations in the Creative Capital Report &mdash;<i> Building Ireland&rsquo;s Audiovisual Creative Economy&mdash;</i> has met on three occasions. The Committee is chaired by my Department and has representation from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Education and Skills, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Irish Film Board, Screen Producers Ireland and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are also represented.  </P>
        <P>The Creative Capital Report identified the strengths and weaknesses of the Irish industry and recommended to Government specific action that will equip the industry to successfully enter the next phase of its growth from a predominantly domestic platform into international markets.</P>
        <P>While the Implementation Committee has met formally on three occasions, informal contact continues between meetings. I expect the Committee&rsquo;s interim report around Easter.</P>

        <P>Under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief is allowed for investments in certain films and TV productions.  The types of productions eligible for certification are feature film, television drama, creative documentary and animation.  The scheme is kept under regular review in consultation with the Irish Film Board and any changes considered necessary are brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance, as appropriate.  The scheme was amended in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and, most recently, in 2011.  The amendments in 2011 extended the scheme for a further three years until the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>The whole area of the development of the Irish audiovisual industry, including incentives to build strong companies, was examined during the preparation of the Creative Capital Report&mdash;<i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Audiovisual Creative Economy</i>.  The Report was published in July and an Implementation Committee is at present examining the advancement of its recommendations.  I am expecting a report from that Committee around Easter.  This strategic review will focus on issues regarding talent development, convergence, sectoral growth, education and the digital opportunities for Ireland, as well as reporting on industry leadership, State agency roles and innovation.  It will provide a road map for the next few years and will assist in enabling <Col N="308" />the domestic audiovisual content production sector to develop into an internationally traded sector for product and services over a five year period 2011 to 2015.</P>
        <P>Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board.  This agency is funded through my Department and has been allocated &euro;15.7 million in 2012 to carry out its functions.</P>

        <P>I have a broad remit to protect Ireland&rsquo;s wildlife and natural heritage.

My Department has significant challenges before it to ensure that Ireland is in full compliance with EU Directives on nature conservation and that we ensure that the richness of Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage contributes to national economic recovery. It is my view that the resources of my Department should be focused on those areas. I will continue to keep all provisions of the Wildlife Acts under review and introduce improvements to the law, where appropriate.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>Positioned at the core of local, regional, urban and rural activities, the arts, creative and heritage-related sectors play a pivotal part in the economic life of communities across the country, including the vital area of employment. Employment in the arts sector embraces a very diverse and broad extent of activities, encompassing those engaged in specific arts practice, as well associated wider elements.</P>
        <P>I believe strongly that cultural tourism can contribute in a significant way to the restoration of the economy and the creation of jobs. A 2009 study reported that employment dependent on the arts, culture and creative sectors combined was 170,000, or 8.7% of total employment in the economy. Taking into account economic multipliers, the same study estimated that the value added dependent on the arts, culture and creative sectors was &euro;11.8 billion, or 7.6% of total GNP.</P>
        <P>A more recent study by Indecon in 2011 showed that total employment in the wider arts sector, which includes film and video, museums and other cultural activities, literature and publishing, amounted to 21,300 and contributed &euro;716m (GVA) to the economy in 2010. I will continue to work to build on these foundations.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, as part of the Public Service Reform Plan, recently announced a radical streamlining of State bodies, including in respect of certain bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group. This includes decisions to combine or merge a number of such bodies. In addition, decisions have been taken to critically review, by June 2012, the streamlining and shared services agenda in respect of a number of other bodies funded from <Col N="310" />my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, including in relation to the merging of the functions of Culture Ireland into my Department. More details in this regard can be accessed on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at <i>www.per.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is recognised, most recently at the Global Irish Economic Forum last October, that arts and culture are Ireland&rsquo;s global calling card and one of our world-class, distinctive strengths as a nation.  The international promotion of Irish arts through my Department&rsquo;s Culture Ireland has made a significant impact &mdash; especially in the US last year with the <i>Imagine Ireland</i> programme &mdash; in restoring our global reputation at a critical time and expanding international markets and audiences for Irish artists.  Equally, in the coming years, the promotion of Irish cultural and creative excellence in Europe and in key growth markets, such as China, offers vital opportunities for the country, working in tandem with the promotion of trade, investment, tourism, food and science.  In particular, our EU Presidency in 2013 will present a platform to strengthen our cultural links with key European partners, such as Germany and France.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that we will be able to continue to deliver the functions of Culture Ireland effectively in the future. The critical review requested by Government is already under way in my Department and I expect to be in a position shortly to take definitive decisions on the matter.</P>

Clearly, the amalgamation and merger of these bodies, including consolidation of boards, raises complex issues, which my Department is currently examining.

        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enabling the publication of the 1926 Census. The project requires two principal components to be addressed. The first is the legal necessity to change the relevant legislation to permit publication of the Census before the expiry of the statutory 100 year period, while respecting certain rights. The second is the technical process whereby the material can be converted from the paper records to a searchable electronic database in a cost-effective fashion. Legal advice has been obtained in relation to the legislative changes and consultation with bodies involved is in progress. Possible technical approaches are also currently being considered, as are their resource implications.</P>

        <P>NAMA was set up to acquire loans from certain financial institutions and it does not own property as such.  In most cases, the property securing these loans is under the control of the debtor and will remain so as long as the debtor continues to meet his obligations.  In the case of certain debtors, NAMA has taken enforcement action and the property securing the loans is now under the control of receivers or other insolvency agents appointed by NAMA.</P>

        <P>I am satisfied that the Centenary commemoration of the Easter Rising in 2016 requires a comprehensive programme that will also present the economic, social and cultural conditions of the period.  The development of the commemorative programme is therefore oriented towards the entire <i>Decade of Centenaries</i>, <i>2012 to 2022</i>, with official consideration currently being focussed on the period from 2012 to 2016.</P>
        <P>The Government envisage a framework that will feature not only the official commemorative programme but also the initiatives of local authorities, national cultural and sporting organisations, heritage groups and community initiatives.  A special effort will be made to ensure that all events are organised on an inclusive basis with respectful regard for the different traditions in Ireland.  As we explore our shared heritage, we will also be mindful of the interest and affinity of the Irish abroad in the commemorative programme.</P>
        <P>With a view to the enhanced engagement required of all partners, arrangements are being made to strengthen the Oireachtas Consultation Group on commemorations, which is expected to meet shortly.</P>

        <P>Under the Public Service Reform Programme announced by Government on 17th November last, the Heritage Council is included in Appendix IIb as a candidate body for critical review by end-June 2012. The focus of the review in relation to the Council is to examine the potential merger of functions of the Council into my Department. Any decision in relation to the future of the Council will await the finalisation of that review. Funding of some &euro;48.421m has been made available to my Department in 2012 to support investment and the delivery of services across the built and natural heritage areas. This represents a reduction from &euro;52.096m in 2011.</P>
        <P>It may be noted that due to the national economic difficulties, there has been a significant reduction in the capital allocations provided to my Department since 2008. However, notwithstanding these constraints, I intend to ensure that service levels are maintained to the extent possible, with funding directed at priority areas of environmental compliance, protection of structures at risk, and supporting tourism and economic renewal.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>The State&rsquo;s principal art collections are managed by the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork.</P>
        <P>The National Gallery of Ireland operates as an autonomous statutory body in accordance with the provisions of the National Gallery of Ireland Act 1928, as amended. The Crawford Art Gallery Cork and the Irish Museum of Modern Art are both incorporated as companies limited by guarantee in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts 1963-2005.  The Boards of these National Cultural Institutions are responsible for all operational matters relating to their institutions, including storage and exhibitions, and I, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, do not have a statutory function in respect of operational matters.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, for security reasons, it is not appropriate to comment on the number, value or significance of art works held by these institutions, either in storage or elsewhere.  It is common policy for public art galleries to rotate their collections and, as a practice, galleries do not maintain static displays.  The rotation of the collections and grouping of art works under inventive exhibition themes maintains the public profile of the galleries and helps attract increased visitor numbers.</P>

The National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is the lead agency for the implementation of The Gathering initiative. The arts, culture, film and heritage sector constitute an essential part of our national tourism offering: indeed, they animate the brand globally. In that context, my Department and the relevant agencies under its aegis are working closely with the lead Department on this important initiative.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a key priority in the Programme for Government is to support and lead economic regeneration, job creation and employment retention over the coming period. In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s resources and financial allocation will be utilised to the greatest extent possible in achieving these aims and delivering on these commitments.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister in March 2011, I have engaged with the various sectors and stakeholders funded by my Department, including the bodies and agencies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, to ensure that maximum benefit and value is obtained from available resources. Indeed, my Department&rsquo;s key priorities and programme of work supportive of job creation and economic regeneration are set out in its Statement of Strategy, which will be published over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there is much potential in the arts and in the cultural, heritage and creative industries to create growth and jobs. A key objective for my Department, therefore, will be to maximise the economic and employment creation potential of the arts, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors. Cultural tourism also has a significant contribution to make to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and the rebuilding of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation on the international stage.</P>
        <P>A further objective for my Department over the coming period will be to promote Irish arts and heritage abroad. It will also seek to facilitate synergies between the arts, cultural, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors, most notably in the area of tourism product development and cultural tourism.</P>

        <P>In January 2007, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government placed a preservation order on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts. The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 is a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government.  The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require my consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. </P>
        <P>The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, of which Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street form part, and for which approval has been granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, envisages the retention of these buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising in No. 16.  The developer&rsquo;s application to my Department for consent to these proposals under section 14 of the National Monuments Acts is being examined.  As part of the process, I have visited the monument site and met various interest groups, including relatives of the 1916 leaders.  My Department is currently in consultation with the National Museum of Ireland in relation to the application and I hope to be able to make a decision on it shortly.</P>
        <P>Any wider plans for the development of the Moore Street area would be a matter for the relevant landowners and the development authority, Dublin City Council.</P>

I will travel to New York to participate in the Invest in Ireland round-table hosted by former President Bill Clinton on 9 February.  This is the event which President Clinton undertook to organise when he attended the Global Irish Economic Forum which we held in Dublin Castle last October.  I will return to the United States on 15 February for a series of engagements in Boston and New York including a number of business meetings, both with Irish firms doing business in the US, and with US firms investing in Ireland.  I will also meet with representatives of the Irish communities there.</P>
        <P>While in Boston, I will take up an invitation to give a lecture at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government.  I will travel to the United States in March for the traditional St Patrick&rsquo;s Day meetings and celebrations.  I will also use the opportunity of the visit &mdash; at a time of the year when Ireland enjoys the highest of profiles around the world &mdash; to visit Chicago and New York as well as Washington to further promote Irish business interests in the US as well as highlighting the attraction of Ireland as a location for US investment.</P>
        <P>I will attend the meetings of the European Council scheduled for 1-2 March, 28-29 June, 18-19 October and 13-14 December. Arrangements for other meetings with key European partners are under consideration in light of on-going developments.  Further visits are envisaged for the latter half of 2012 in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s 2013 Presidency of the Council of the EU.</P>

        <P>The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) is an advisory Council which provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. Details of the appointments I have made to the NESC since coming into office on 9 March, 2011 are set out in the accompanying table.</P>
        <P>The appointments were made in accordance with the provisions of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 as amended by the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.    In the particular case of the NESC, I should emphasise that most of the members are appointed on the basis of nominations received from representative organisations.  Historically, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson posts are <Col N="319" />filled from my Department at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary level.  I am satisfied that the other appointments were appropriate, bearing in mind the key strategic role of the NESC.</P>

        <P>A senior official from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Secretary General of the Department <Col N="320" />of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador-designate to the Holy See, attended the meeting of the Ireland Stand Up campaign on 18 January 2012.  They both spoke with members of the Ireland Stand Up campaign about their concerns.    As was outlined in my statement of 3 November last year, the decision of the Government to close our embassy to the Holy See and to appoint a non-resident Ambassador was driven by economic factors deriving from our need to cut public expenditure and focus the modest resources of our diplomatic service on economic recovery.  The total cost saving in a full year is estimated at &euro;845,000.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to review our diplomatic network and it may be that, as public finances recover, we will at some time in the future be able to reopen a modest resident embassy to the Holy See.  I understand that the Catholic Bishops have issued an invitation to Pope Benedict to visit Ireland on the occasion of the International Eucharistic Congress in 2012, and that this invitation is under consideration by the Holy See. As I have made clear previously, if the Government receives an indication that the Pope wishes to travel to Ireland for the Eucharistic Congress, or on a subsequent occasion, the Government will be more than ready to issue a formal invitation and to welcome him to Ireland.  The willingness of the Government to invite Pope Benedict to Ireland was made very clear by our Ambassador designate, when he met Vatican officials in Rome earlier this month.</P>

        <P>Arrangements are currently being put in place aimed at bringing the turnaround time for properly completed Irish passports submitted in Britain to approximately three weeks.  This will be comparable to passport services offered by other jurisdictions to their citizens who are resident overseas.   There have been some technical problems with the telephone system in the Passport Service and this had resulted in difficulties for customers.  These issues have now been resolved.  Notwithstanding this, the Passport Service handles over two hundred calls per day from UK residents, or approximately 25% of all calls received.</P>
        <P>I can also confirm that additional temporary staff have been recruited, some of whom are already in training, and this will increase further the capacity of the Passport Service to take telephone queries.  It is not possible to comment on the specific detail of the complaint from <Col N="321" />the named individual as neither the identity of the applicant nor the application number have been provided.</P>

It is quite common for Irish people to be citizens of other countries and thus hold passports from those countries.  These entitlements do not affect their rights under Irish law to Irish citizenship or their right to an Irish passport, although the other country or countries of which they are citizens may have regulations regarding dual citizenship.</P>

        <TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>The legal situation of children born through surrogacy arrangements is a very complex area in Irish law.  Whereas there is no specific legislation in Ireland relating to surrogacy, a range of Irish laws relating to the areas of citizenship, guardianship, consent for the child to travel and other parental rights must be comprehensively addressed by applicants before any travel document may issue.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has responsibility for the issuance of passports, but it may only do so when the above issues, which largely relate to areas of law within the competence of other Departments, such as the Department of Justice and Equality, have been resolved.     When issuing passports, the Passport Service is obliged to respect the law as it stands.  In determining whether a child born outside the State is an Irish citizen, it is necessary first of all to establish whether the child was born to an Irish parent.  Furthermore, in general, only a parent or guardian may apply for a travel document on behalf of an Irish citizen child.  Thus the questions of who are the legal parents of the child, and who are the <Col N="323" />legal guardians of the child must be examined in order to determine whether a child born outside the State is an Irish citizen, and whether consequently an Irish travel document may be issued to the child.  </P>
        <P>In considering these questions it is important to be aware that the fact that a genetic relationship exists between a commissioning adult and the child does not mean that he or she is automatically the legal parent of the child under Irish law.</P>
        <P>Under Irish law the woman who gives birth to the child &mdash; the surrogate mother &mdash; is the legal mother of the child, even if the ovum from which the child was produced was provided by one of the commissioning adults, or by a donor.  Under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the mother of a child born outside marriage is the child&rsquo;s sole guardian.  Under Irish law, family relationships and the rights and responsibilities that flow from them cannot be subjected to the ordinary law of contract and cannot, in particular, be transferred to another person, bought, or sold.  This means that, under Irish law, the surrogate mother and the child will have a life-long legal relationship with one another.</P>
        <P>If the surrogate mother is married, then under section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987, the surrogate mother&rsquo;s husband is presumed by law to be the father of the child, unless the contrary is proved on balance of probabilities.  The husband will also, along with the surrogate mother, be the joint guardian of the child.  If the commissioning father is the genetic father of the child, it is possible to overcome the presumption of paternity in favour of the surrogate mother&rsquo;s husband, so as to allow the commissioning father to be recognised as the legal parent of the child.  However, this requires an application for a declaration of parentage to be made to the Circuit Court under Part VI of the Status of Children Act 1987.</P>
        <P>If the surrogate mother is not married, and the commissioning father is the genetic father of the child, then the Irish authorities may recognise his paternity of the child on receipt of reliable DNA evidence.  However, because the commissioning father is not married to the surrogate mother, he is not automatically a guardian of the child under Irish law, even if he has been granted a declaration of parentage.  The Department therefore recommends that legal advice should be sought about the appropriate mechanism for arranging for the commissioning father to be made a guardian of the child.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of passports, it is very much in the best interest of any newly born infant arriving into the State that they are accompanied by an adult with whom they have a legally recognised relationship and who has legal authority to make decisions, including medical decisions, on their behalf.  The Irish authorities will therefore, in the best interests of child, seek undertakings from commissioning adults that they notify their local health centre of the child&rsquo;s arrival in the State and encourage them to seek a court order establishing the commissioning father&rsquo;s legal relationship with the child, thereby allowing him to make decisions, including medical decisions, on behalf of the child.</P>
        <P>I understand that the preparation of guidelines by the Department of Justice and Equality in this area is at an advanced stage and I would expect that they will be published over the coming months.</P>

        <P>The total net economies that will be achieved by the closure of the Embassies to the Holy See and Iran and the Irish Representative office in Timor Leste are estimated at &euro;1.175 million over a full year.  It is expected that these savings will be fully realised in 2013. However, in 2012, there will be immediate disengagement costs (for example, local staff severance payments, running down of rental and other contracts) and the net savings from the closures this year are estimated at about &euro;480,000.</P>
        <P>Net savings in respect of the closure of the Embassy to the Holy See are estimated at &euro;400,000 this year and &euro;845,000 in 2013.  These projections take into consideration the relocation of the offices of the Embassy to Italy and the residence of the Ambassador to Italy to the state-owned Villa Spada.  It is expected that the transfer will be completed during the course of the present year and that the full year rental savings, amounting to &euro;445,000, will be realised in 2013.</P>
        <P>The corresponding figures for Tehran are &euro;80,000 this year and &euro;330,000 in 2013.</P>
        <P>The savings on closure of the office in Dili, estimated at about &euro;200,000 in a full year, will be reallocated within the Irish Aid programme.</P>

        <P>The Council of the European Union is a key decision-making institution of the EU, at whose meetings all EU Member States are represented.    As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have represented Ireland frequently at Council meetings. Since March 2011, I have attended 3 Foreign Affairs Councils, 1 General Affairs Council and 2 informal meetings of Foreign Ministers, the so-called &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meetings. </P>
        <P>Between December 2009-March 2011, Ministers of Foreign Affairs attended 5 meetings of the General Affairs Council and 5 meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council. Between January 2007-December 2009, when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, Ministers of Foreign Affairs attended 21 meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Between January 2007-March 2011, Ministers of Foreign Affairs attended 6 &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meetings. In 2010, the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended one European Council (to which Ministers of Foreign Affairs were invited).</P>
        <P>On the occasions when a Minister of Foreign Affairs was unable to attend these meetings, Ireland has normally been represented by a Ministerial colleague, generally the Minister for State for European Affairs.</P>
        <P>Since March 2011, the Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs, Ms Lucinda Creighton T.D. has attended 4 Foreign Affairs Councils and 9 General Affairs Councils.</P>
        <Col N="325" />
        <P>Between December 2009-March 2011, Ministers of State attended 7 meetings of the General Affairs Council and 6 meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council. Between January 2007-December 2009, when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, Ministers of State attended 11 meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Between January 2007-March 2011, Ministers of State attended 2 &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meetings.</P>
        <P>In addition, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Brendan Howlin T.D. represented Ireland at 1 meeting of the General Affairs Council (Cohesion Policy).</P>
        <P>On 8 occasions between January 2007-March 2011, it was not possible for any Minister or Minister of State to attend one of these Council meetings. On these occasions, Ireland was represented by the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the European Union.</P>
        <P>Full details of attendance, at meetings of the General Affairs Council, Foreign Affairs Council, General Affairs and External Relations Council and &ldquo;Gymnichs&rdquo;, are listed below.</P>
        <P>It was the practice up until the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009 for Foreign Ministers to attend European Council meetings. Between January 2007 and December 2009, Ministers for Foreign Affairs attended 12 European Council meetings.</P>

        <P>Responsibility for visas rests with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  However, my Department is working with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Law Reform and other relevant Government Departments with a view to implementing additional protections, including revised procedures related to entry requirements for private domestic workers in diplomatic households consistent with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.  Revised procedures will be introduced as soon as this work has been completed and agreement has been reached with the relevant Government Departments on the measures to be implemented.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 103, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my earlier reply to which the Deputy refers, the primary purpose of my recent visit to the Middle East was to meet the parties in relation to the Middle East Peace Process, to hear from them the prospects and obstacles as they see them, and to encourage them to commit seriously to this effort.  I also wished to look for myself at some of the issues on the ground.</P>
        <P>My expressed intention to develop Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations in the region referred to the normal range of contacts between states and peoples, which we seek to promote. This would include, as it would in any country which I visit, the possibilities for increasing Irish trade there &mdash; in this case with Israel. I have made very clear that it is not my view that our strong criticisms of Israeli policies in relation to the Occupation must constitute the totality of our relations; indeed I believe that to do so would only weaken the weight carried by our views, both in Israel, which we seek to persuade, and among our European partners. No Irish Government has supported suggestions that we should boycott trade or other relations with Israel, or contacts with Israeli people.</P>
        <P>I have already on previous occasions made very clear my strong views not only on the illegality of settlements, but on the obstacle they increasingly pose to the achievement of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, which should be the priority of all sides concerned. <Col N="332" />This was of course an important element in the views I conveyed in my discussions with Israeli leaders during my visit, although my principal focus was on the overall issue of promoting substantive peace talks and a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians which will help bring the Occupation to an end.</P>
        <P>I am of course aware of the position of international law on the status of the Occupied Territories. My visit, in keeping with our normal practice, was arranged in accordance with this. I can confirm that no Israeli security escort accompanied myself or the accompanying delegation during my visit to the Occupied Territories.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 106, 108 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The proposed betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will amend the 1931 Betting Act to <i>inter alia</i> establish the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, including measures to enforce the regulatory framework. The drafting of the Bill, which is fairly complex, is well advanced. The Finance Act 2011 contained measures to allow for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and for a 15% gross profit tax to betting exchanges. The taxation provisions are subject to a Ministerial Commencement order which can only be commenced when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.</P>
        <P>In relation to the taxation treatment of betting exchanges, it is the operator of the betting exchange that will be liable to the gross profit tax which is also the position in the UK.</P>

        <P>All consignments of mineral oil from Northern Ireland are subject to requirements of EU law for the Intra-EU movement of excisable products. These requirements include the paying or securing of the excise duty due in the State, and that the consignment is at all times under cover of the appropriate documentation.  In keeping, however, with the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, there can be no systematic or random checking of these consignments at the border, and a consignment may only be stopped and checked where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there has been a breach of requirements. The consignment may then be stopped by Revenue officers, and documents may be examined and the mineral oil sampled and tested.</P>
        <P>Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect illicit practices involving mineral oil fraud, including optimum deployment of resources to intercept illicit product, and sampling and testing of mineral oil, both in the course of consignment and at retail outlets.</P>

        <P>The position is that the stamp duty exemption for &ldquo;first time buyers&rdquo; has been abolished in relation to instruments executed on or after 8 December 2011.  As regards instruments executed on or before 7 December 2011, a &ldquo;first-time buyer&rdquo; for stamp duty purposes is a person (or where there is more than one buyer, each person) who has not on any previous occasion, either individually or jointly, purchased or built on his or her own behalf, or in a fiduciary capacity, a house in Ireland or abroad.  A person is also regarded as a purchaser where a gift of a house is taken on or after 22 June 2000 or a gift of part of a house is taken on or after 27 June 2000.</P>
        <P>As regards the tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans (known as mortgage interest), the description &ldquo;first time buyer&rdquo; is used to describe an individual who is entitled to tax relief on greater amounts of interest paid and at higher rates of relief for the first 7 tax years in respect of which that individual is entitled to claim tax relief on interest paid on qualifying home loans.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am introducing increased relief for those purchasers of houses for the first time in the 2004 to 2008 period and details will be in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

        <Quest> the tax breaks and allowances that exist here for the purchase of and maintenance of commercial property; the cost of these to the Exchequer on annual basis for the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where a commercial premises is in use for the conduct of a trade or profession, or where the premises is being let for such a business, then any normal, recurring, non-capital expenses which are incurred in the purchase, maintenance, upkeep, decoration and repair will generally be treated as deductible expenses for tax purposes. The expenses qualifying include interest payable on a loan to purchase, extend, repair or maintain a commercial building.  The tax code also provides a general scheme of capital allowances in respect of expenditure on the construction of certain industrial buildings.  The type of buildings that qualify under the general scheme of capital allowances for industrial buildings include factories and mills, harbours, airport runways and aprons, farm buildings and hotels and other tourist infrastructure. In general, buildings such as offices or retail premises are regarded as commercial and no capital allowances are available in respect of the cost of their construction. The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; rate at which capital allowances apply to industrial buildings under the general scheme is currently 4% per annum over 25 years.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the various property and area-based incentive schemes, which have operated for many years, capital allowances were available in respect of the construction or refurbishment of certain commercial and industrial buildings. These schemes have all now been terminated except for the Specialist Palliative Care Units Scheme (which was never commenced) and the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme (expiry 31/5/2015).</P>
        <P>These incentive reliefs allow expenditure on industrial and commercial buildings to be written off for tax purposes at a faster rate than might otherwise be the case.  In addition, the schemes provided relief for buildings, which would not otherwise get relief in the first place.</P>
        <P>Following an Economic Impact Assessment carried out by my Department during 2011, certain restrictions are being introduced as to how allowances, which were available under the various property and area-based incentive schemes, can be used after the end of 2014.  These measures, which I announced in the Budget last December, only apply to passive investors and the details will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill. Under the proposed measures investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes (that is, schemes where allowances of greater <Col N="335" />than 4% per annum apply) will no longer be able to use unused capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular building where that tax life ends on or after 1 January 2015.  Where the tax life of a building has ended before January 2015, no carry forward of unused allowances into the tax year 2015 or any later tax year will be allowed.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have provided the following table which sets out the various property incentive schemes referred to above and the final termination date for incurring qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure under each scheme.</P>

An accelerated rate of 15% per annum (10% in year 7) applied in relation to construction/refurbishment expenditure incurred from 28/1/1994 up to 31/07/2008, subject to certain transitional arrangements being met.  For expenditure incurred after that date, or where the transitional arrangements were not met, the annual allowance is 4%.</P>

        <P>Budget 2012 saw an increase in the rate of both Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) from 25% to 30%.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the CAT tax rate by 10% to 40% could be in the region of &euro;110 million.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from increasing the CGT tax rate by 10% to 40% could be in the region of &euro;166 million. This figure includes corporate gains.  However, these estimates assume no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers, and large increases in rates such as are contemplated in the question may have a significant behavioural impact and may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution. In addition, increasing the rate could, in theory, lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, although staff are not based full-time at Ireland West Airport Knock, there is a Customs presence for the majority of flights, including all flights from high risk destinations as determined by Revenue&rsquo;s risk analysis and profiling systems. Attendance by Customs officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence. A drugs detector dog is frequently in attendance and X-ray equipment is in regular use in the arrivals terminal. Flights with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular interest.  Attendances by Customs officers cover the full range of flight times and are kept under constant review, in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increases at the Airport.  This approach is in line with international practice in smaller airports and is also an efficient use of limited resources.  Revenue is aware of new flights commencing shortly at Knock and will keep the level and extent of customs controls under review, as necessary, based on risk analysis of those additional flights.</P>

        <Quest> if the terms of reference being used by the troika as it works towards producing a common paper on a possible alternative to the IBRC promissory notes, include the possibility of proposing some form of new substitute financial instruments as opposed to merely adjusting the interest rate and/or the duration of repayment of the existing promissory notes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government is currently in detailed discussions with its European partners about restructuring the promissory notes held by IBRC. These promissory notes are funded by emergency liquidity assistance, or ELA, provided by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). This ELA is itself funded by the CBI through Intra-Eurosystem liabilities and any repayments of ELA are used to reduce this liab<Col N="338" />ility on the Central Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet.  If the discussions about restructuring the promissory notes are successful, it could result in the replacement of these notes with an alternative instrument and a change in the repayment profile of the associated funding. The government&rsquo;s approach in this matter is to vigorously pursue a resolution that is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests but to do so with the agreement of the ECB, the IMF and EC.</P>

        <P>The Budget Day forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3 per cent in 2012. The Budget Day forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information (domestic and international) available up to end-November 2011, and was mid-range at that time. Given the highly uncertain environment, the Budget documentation also pointed to a number of risks to this forecast &mdash; some to the downside and some to the upside.  This uncertainty has continued into 2012 and is reflected in the wide range of GDP projections for this year, not just for Ireland, but also for the euro area. Indeed, the Troika&rsquo;s January forecast of 0.5 per cent growth reflects heightened concerns about the euro-area outlook.</P>
        <P>While the Troika has revised down its real GDP growth forecast for this year, it still sees the overall deficit target of 8.6 per cent as achievable, albeit with risks &mdash; as is always the case with any forecast in any year. In this respect, it is important to highlight that it is the nominal growth rate of GDP (i.e. volume and price changes) which drives tax revenue and affects the various fiscal ratios. It is also crucial to point out that the Exchequer budgetary position at end-2011 was better than anticipated at Budget time, providing a small safety margin in terms of achieving the 2012 deficit target.</P>
        <P>We are only a month into the New Year so talking about a mid-term adjustment at the moment is not appropriate. My Department will continue to monitor the economic and budgetary situation over the coming months, in particular the monthly Exchequer Statement, and this will inform official thinking on these matters. As is the norm, my Department will publish a revised set of economic and budgetary forecasts in the April Stability Programme Update.</P>

Revenue does not and could not be expected to provide formal confirmation or assurance of the bona fides of any tax professional.

I am advised by Revenue that the debt owed by the persons concerned was referred to the Sheriff when an arrangement for payment acceptable to Revenue was not agreed. The persons concerned are paying the debt owed to the Sheriff through an interim phased payment subsequently agreed with the Sheriff. This arrangement is due to be reviewed by the Sheriff at the end of February. The persons concerned will have an opportunity to bring any material matters to the Sheriff&rsquo;s attention in the context of that review.</P>

        <P>I have not asked the Central Bank of Ireland to allow IBRC to delay repayments of the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) provided. The Deputy will be aware that while there is an implicit link between the current repayment <Col N="341" />schedule on the Promissory Note and ELA there is no specific repayment schedule, as such, in relation to ELA. Any discussions in relation to ELA would of necessity have to include the ECB.  As I have indicated, I am committed to reviewing the approach to the Promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State of correcting the banking system. The troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate, etc.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this technical review I have commenced an intensive campaign at political level to garner support for an approach which is more beneficial to the Irish State. The Minister has met with Commissioner Rehn and Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank last week to progress the matter.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU, I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.</P>

        <P>The Government is currently in technical discussions with its European partners about restructuring the promissory notes held by IBRC. These promissory notes are funded by exceptional liquidity assistance, or ELA, provided by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). This ELA is itself funded by the CBI through Intra-Eurosystem liabilities and any repayments of ELA are used to reduce this liability on the Central Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet. If the discussions about any restructuring of the promissory notes are successful, it could result in the replacement of these notes with an alternative instrument and a change in the repayment profile of the associated funding. The government&rsquo;s approach in this matter is to vigorously pursue a resolution that is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests but to do so with the agreement of the ECB, the IMF and EC.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Exceptional Liquidity Assistance or ELA is one of the ways that the Central Bank has responded to the financial crisis. This is distinct and separate from regular funding operations carried out for monetary policy implementation purposes through the ECB. A loan provided to a credit institution under ELA is granted against suitable collateral, where suitability is in line with unpublished criteria defined by the Central Bank. As with procedures for ECB eligible collateral, appropriate haircuts/discounts are applied with a view to ensuring that the Central Bank would not suffer any loss in the event of default on the loan assistance. Any ELA provided by a central bank is funded through Intra-Eurosystem liabilities. As such, any  repayments of ELA are used to reduce this liability on the Central Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet.</P>

        <P>In my Department, I understand that although the Secretary General&rsquo;s nominal salary is significantly higher than &euro;200,000, he has gifted the excess to the state on a voluntary basis.  The position of private secretary to the Minister is currently staffed in my Department by a civil servant at Administrative Officer level who receives an allowance of &euro;20,685 per annum in respect of the extra duties and responsibilities attaching to the post including extra attendance outside normal hours.</P>
        <P>The allowance for private secretaries to Ministers was reduced by 5% on 1 January 2010 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009. In December last, it was announced that all Departments will have to achieve a reduction of 5% in the cost of allowances and premium payments in 2012. In this regard all allowances in the public service, including the allowance payable to private secretaries to Ministers, are currently subject to a review led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

        <P LI="1">Dr. Roisin O&rsquo;Sullivan</P>
        <P FLI="0">As Minister for Finance I announced the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a non-statutory basis on 7 July 2011.  The Council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government and is a requirement of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland. When establishing the Council, I stated that the Council would be an independent body whose existence and independence would be underpinned by legislation to be brought forward by Government in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill.</P>
        <Col N="343" />
        <P>The Chairman did not undergo interview by Oireachtas Committee but the Fiscal Council appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 17 November 2011 to discuss their first fiscal assessment report published in October.</P>
        <P>I appointed the members having regard to a number of criteria including the desirability of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds (academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance), macroeconomic/microeconomic expertise and a strong international dimension, as well as the need to take gender considerations into account. I am satisfied that the appointed members have the mix of skills and experience, including in relation to fiscal affairs, to ensure that the Council will be highly effective in fulfilling its mandate.  The Fiscal Responsibility Bill will include provisions for the appointment of members once the Council is on a statutory footing.</P>

        <P>As specific skills are required due to the nature of the business model at IBRC it was decided on this occasion not to proceed with the public advertisement of the vacancies.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, I have formed a panel of suitably qualified people in 2011 for possible appointment or nomination to the board of certain banks following a public expressions of interest process.  Recently, Bank of Ireland has appointed Mr. Patrick Haren who was included on this panel to their Court (board).</P>

        <P>The person concerned called to the Revenue office in Cork in early January and was advised that he was exempt from tax.  On a more detailed review, it now appears that this information was incorrect, and Revenue regrets any distress caused by the incorrect information.  The most recent figures available to Revenue indicate that an occupational pension of approximately &euro;25,000 was paid in 2010, and that a contributory State pension of approximately &euro;22,400 has been payable since late 2010. Based on this information, and assuming those income levels continue, this person and his spouse will exceed the exemption limit for a jointly assessed couple.  Revenue has issued a revised tax credit certificate based on this assumption.</P>
        <P>If the person feels that the information held by Revenue is incorrect, it is recommended that the person concerned complete a Form 12 (Return of Income) for 2011 to ensure that Revenue&rsquo;s information is complete.  If he has any other queries, he should telephone Revenue on 1890 22 24 25.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware the bank has no means of establishing the underlying ownership of these securities which are freely tradeable once issued. These securities are publicly traded and dealt through market participants and settled by clearing house systems. An issuer does not have any access to the records of the clearing house. At maturity, the Bank will instruct its paying agent to transfer the funds due to the clearing house which will then distribute the funds to the holders of the securities as per their records. Even where the bank is presented with lists alleging to represent names of bondholders I am informed there is no way for the bank or anyone else to verify the veracity of such lists.  In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that there is nothing further I can do to identify the names of the bondholders.</P>

        <P>Income tax relief at an individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate is allowed (within limits) on contributions made to supplementary private pension arrangements, including personal pension plans and retirement annuity contracts. Investment growth in such pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners is also exempt from tax. The purpose of these various tax relief arrangements is to allow individuals to supplement any State pension income they may be entitled to with private pension income in retirement. The use of tax-relieved private pension savings to purchase additional State pension entitlements either here or elsewhere is not permitted and I have no plans to change that position.  Retirement benefits can be taken from a personal pension plan or retirement annuity contract at any time after age 60 and before age 75 without any requirement to give up work, so if the individual is 65 he is free to take his benefits. The options available are as follows:</P>
        <P>Up to 25% of the accumulated fund may be taken as a lump sum that is tax-free up to a lifetime limit of &euro;200,000.  The options available with the remainder of the pension fund are&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          to purchase an annuity,</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), or</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The latter two options are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required to an amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present. Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF) must be chosen <Col N="346" />into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested from the pension fund equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &mdash;&euro;119,800 at present &mdash; or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware none of the institutions in receipt of State Aid has used State Funds directly to offset deficits in defined benefit pension schemes. This assurance, provided by the banks, would cover the direct transfer of funds provided in State Aid towards the reduction of deficits in the banks' pension schemes. The institutions do contribute, as required by law and regulation, to pension schemes in the normal way. Deficits that exist in pension schemes in the institutions are being reduced generally through increased employee contributions and reductions in future benefits.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, an institution&rsquo;s funds are not generally segregated by source for distribution in specific ways. It is very difficult in terms of a bank's funding to categorically state that State Aid  does not indirectly find its way through normal employee contribution or pre-State Aid contractual arrangements into pension funds. However, in terms of the principal at issue I am assured by the institutions that none of the institutions has used State funds directly to off-set deficits in defined benefit pension scheme funds.</P>

        <Quest>  the rationale behind the stipulation in the application for tax relief for passengers with disabilities stating that the car must be purchased from an authorised dealer; if he will define an authorised dealer; if there is any mechanism whereby a person who purchased a vehicle privately can have it authorised; if there are any plans to change the current regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an authorised dealer is a person who is authorised under section 136 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) &ldquo;<i>to manufacture, distribute, deal in, deliver, store, repair or modify unregistered vehicles and to convert registered vehicles</i>&rdquo;.  Authorisation brings a number of responsibilities concerning the management and record keeping in relation to vehicles, responsibilities that are subject to control and scrutiny by the Commissioners.  Because of the significant amount of relief from both VRT and VAT available to purchasers of vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme, it is appropriate that vehicles provided under this scheme should be provided by authorised dealers to facilitate the monitoring of various elements of the scheme.</P>
        <P>As it is the dealer who supplies a vehicle that is authorised and not the vehicle, it is not possible to retrospectively authorise a vehicle purchased privately.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to change the current regulations regarding authorisation.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, where telecommunications providers incorrectly apply VAT to charitable donations made via SMS text messages, as distinct from applying it to any fees charged by them, VAT legislation allows for the telecommunications providers to refund to their customers the VAT overcharged, provided that their systems and records are capable of identifying the overcharges and giving adequate proof as to the nature of any refunds, in accordance with the normal rules.  VAT legislation does not allow Revenue to make refunds of VAT, overcharged by suppliers of services or goods, directly to the customers of such suppliers.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of taxes and duties and for tackling the smuggling of dutiable and prohibited goods, including tobacco products and narcotics, that they regard anti-smuggling prevention as a high priority area. The use of enforcement equipment such as mobile X-ray scanners, Revenue cutters and other detection technologies is just one part of a multi-faceted strategy employed by Revenue to tackle smuggling.  This strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of smuggling activity and developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis. It necessitates ongoing review of operational policies and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept contraband product.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Revenue consistently monitors ongoing developments in available X-ray and other technologies, and the selection and deployment of detection equipment is constantly reviewed. Revenue has made use of the European Union Hercule II Programme in the past to fund detection equipment and will apply for funding, when appropriate, in the future. The actual technology selected and the operational deployment of that technology is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Under the present rules of the EU Hercule II Programme, Ireland would have to fund a minimum of 50% of the capital costs and 100% of the on-going operational costs of a new container scanner. The capital cost of a new mobile X-ray container scanner is in the region of &euro;3 million with annual running costs of approximately &euro;320,000.</P>
        <P>Revenue currently has two mobile X-ray container scanning systems, the second of which was commissioned in January 2010. One scanner is based in Dublin Port and the other at Rosslare Ferry Port. However, both scanners are available for deployment at other ports as required. Revenue deploys the scanners on a risk assessment basis at various locations throughout the country. In addition to the container scanners, Revenue also uses smaller static baggage/ parcel scanners, which are deployed at all major ports, airports and postal depots. Two new X-ray scanners were also purchased within the last 12 months for use in postal depots. Revenue also expects to procure a smaller mobile Scan Van in 2012 and has submitted an application for co-funding for this to the European Union Hercule II programme.  With regard to mobile container scanners Revenue is satisfied that the two main container ports in the State are adequately serviced and has no plans to acquire any such additional scanners.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners currently have two cutters in service, RCC Suirbheir, which was brought into service in 2004 and RCC Faire, which entered service in 2009.  Both vessels are involved on an ongoing basis in the patrol and monitoring of the State&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction and adjacent waters.  These patrol/monitoring activities are aimed at the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of prohibited and dutiable goods, including narcotics and tobacco products, smuggled or illegally imported into, or intended to be exported out of, the State/EU. They are also involved in servicing national and international arrangements and Mutual Assistance requests from other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The Revenue cutters are part of a multi-faceted strategy employed by Revenue in combating drugs trafficking and other smuggling by sea.  The Revenue cutters operate in co-operation with land based Revenue officials and other State enforcement agencies to combat drugs trafficking into Ireland by sea and co-operating with international customs agencies to combat international drugs trafficking by sea.</P>
        <Col N="353" />
        <P>Revenue constantly monitors its equipment requirements in the light of new technologies and changing risks.  They have advised that they are satisfied that there is no current requirement for an additional cutter.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the decision of the Financial Regulator to restrict lending to credit unions; his further views on whether this will mean credit unions will have less money to earn from interest in order for the money to be put into reserves required by the Financial Regulator; his further views on whether this decision was made as part of a long-term plan to restrict the number of credit unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The imposition of lending restrictions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to examine or adjudicate on whether the placing of lending restrictions is necessary on a case by case basis.  I believe that such action would represent interference in the work of the independent regulator.</P>
        <P>While loan interest is a valuable source of income for credit unions, it is important that lending takes places in accordance with regulatory requirements in order to protect the savings of members in credit unions and to ensure that credit unions focus on risks when making lending decisions.  Restrictions are imposed on a case-by-case basis and are reviewed regularly.  The type of lending restrictions can include maximum individual loan size, overall maximum monthly lending limits and restrictions on business lending.</P>
        <P>The Registrar has advised that about 50% of credit unions are subject to lending restrictions at present.  Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions over 65% can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member.  Less than 3% of credit unions are restricted to loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member, and less than 1% of credit unions are restricted to lending less than &euro;5,000 per member.  Commercial lending restrictions apply to approximately a third of credit unions.</P>
        <P>The imposition of lending restrictions is part of the normal regulation and supervision of the sector and is not part of credit union restructuring.  The Commission on Credit Unions was established to review  and make recommendations on the future of the credit union movement, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.  The Interim Report of the Commission was published in October 2011 and was welcomed by all the stakeholders.  The Final Report is to be provided to me by the end of March 2012.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware I am not in a position to provide a list of the bondholders who were repaid the gross payment of &euro;1.25 billion.  I am advised that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors.  Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.  Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream).  When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company which in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.</P>
        <P>The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders.  This is a standard process for all such issuances.  Therefore throughout this entire process the bond issuer is unaware of the individual bondholders&rsquo; details.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) usually meets monthly, although it can meet more frequently, if required.  Formal Ecofin meetings are held in Brussels or Luxembourg; informal Ecofin meetings are convened in the country holding the six-monthly Presidency (usually April and October).  Separately to the Ecofin meetings, Eurogroup meetings usually take place on the evening beforehand.  In many cases when the Minister could not attend an Ecofin meeting, he would have attended the Eurogroup meeting that preceded it.  61 meetings of the Ecofin Council have been held between 2007 and 2011.  Since my appointment as Minister for Finance, 11 meetings of Ecofin took place in 2011 and I attended ten of these meetings.  Mr. Brian Hayes TD, Minister of State <Col N="355" />at the Department of Finance attended a meeting of Ecofin on 14 June 2011, as I was abroad on official business in the US.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland has the highest prices and excise duty levels for cigarettes in the EU and already applies a high specific duty element and a low <i>ad valorem</i> element in setting its excise duty for cigarettes relative to other Member States.  However the question of re-balancing the excise tax structure will be examined in the context of the 2012 Finance Bill.</P>

        <Quest> the potential implications for financial institutions in this State of the inclusion in the draft European bank capital directive the requirement that all loans be treated as in default when they are in arrears for more than 90 days, particularly the impact on banks&rsquo; capital requirements and their ability to work with mortgage holders in arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>I am informed by the Central Bank that it does not see any material near-term impact on banks&rsquo; capital levels or on their ability to work with mortgage holders in arrears from the draft Capital Requirements Directive provision on the definition of default (Article 174).  In the current Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2006/48/EC), which Ireland transposed through SI No.661 of 2006, default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either </P>
        <P>a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security; or</P>
        <P>b) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. I am informed by the Central Bank that its assessment is that the definition of default in the proposed new directive remains broadly the same.</P>
        <P>People experiencing difficulties with their mortgage arrears are covered by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the CCMA).  The Central Bank also produced a consumer guide to assist consumers in understanding the new process and what they should expect from lenders.  The guide is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website at  <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection/documents/code of conduct on mortgage arrears 1 january 2011.pdf</i>.</P>

        <P>To date, Ireland&rsquo;s nominal borrowings from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility under the EU/IMF Programme amount to &euro;38.2 billion.  The following table, provided by the NTMA, sets out the loans drawn down to date from each source under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland along with the interest rate for these loans.  The interest rates reflect the interest rate margin reductions agreed in respect of loans from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM).   </P>

        <P>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I have previously provided a response to a question put down by the Deputy on 11 May 2011 (ref: 10806/11) in relation to the translated version of the National Anthem that is commonly in use today.  In that response I referred to an article that was written by Ms Ruth Sherry, Professor of English in the University of Trondheim in Norway entitled &ldquo;The Story of the National Anthem&rdquo;.  The article appeared in the publication, History Ireland, in Spring 1996.</P>
        <P>In her article Ms Sherry makes the point that the Irish translation which became generally known and used was written perhaps as early as 1917 by Liam &Oacute; Rinn, who later became Chief Translator to the Oireachtas.  He translated the first line of the chorus, &lsquo;Soldiers are we, whose lives are pledged to Ireland&rsquo; as &ldquo;Sinne fianna fail, at&aacute; f&aacute; gheall ag &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;&rsquo;.  A copy of the article can be found on the following website: <i>http://www.historyireland.com/ volumes/volume4/issue1/features/?id=113150</i>.</P>
        <P>Included in the article, it states that &ldquo;(Liam) &Oacute; Rinn translated the first line of the chorus, &lsquo;Soldiers are we, whose lives are pledged to Ireland&rsquo;, as &lsquo;Sinne fianna f&aacute;il, at&aacute; f&aacute; gheall ag &Eacute;irinn&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Before the Treaty, the Volunteers had identified themselves in Irish as descendants of Finn Mac Cool&rsquo;s warriors, the Fianna, and Inis F&aacute;il was believed to be an old name for Ireland: hence &lsquo;Fianna F&aacute;il, the Soldiers of Ireland&rsquo;.  The Volunteers wore insignia incorporating the letters FF.  These insignia were carried over and used by the National Army after the establishment of the Free State, and are still used on army uniforms today.  Thus &Oacute; Rinn&rsquo;s rendering of Kearney&rsquo;s &lsquo;soldiers&rsquo; as &lsquo;fianna f&aacute;il&rsquo; is an apt reference to the group which adopted the song, and, in the context of the early publication of his translation in An tOglach in 1923, the first line constitutes a reference to the continuity between the Volunteers and the Free State army.</P>
        <P>This translation was made well before &Eacute;amon de Valera&rsquo;s founding in 1926 of the political party which was also given the name Fianna F&aacute;il.  This shows that there is no reflection to a political party name in the translation version of the National Anthem.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Paymaster General&rsquo;s Office, which is part of my Department, has two operational units.  One of the units provides a banking service to Departments and Offices.  It is not involved in policy matters. Due to automation of processes and the decline in the number of paper payments (payable orders) from 4.2 million in 2001 to 295,000 in 2011, it has been possible to reduce the number of staff in the unit, from a headcount of 18 in 2004 to four full time staff today.</P>
        <P>Under the Public Service Reform Plan, which was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is intended during 2012 to develop a strategic business case, in consultation with key impacted Department representatives, for a shared banking service to be used by all Government Departments/Offices and their Agencies in due course.  In the circumstances, I do not consider it warranted, or appropriate, to put the Paymaster General&rsquo;s Office on a Constitutional footing, which would require a referendum with attendant costs.</P>

        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Government, therefore, established an Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears to consider what additional measures could be introduced to assist people experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Group&rsquo;s report was published last October and the implementation of its recommendations is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to tackle mortgage difficulty.</P>
        <P>With regard to mortgage holders in arrears or in danger of going into financial difficulty, the Central Bank revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) offers increased protections.  The revised CCMA, which came into effect from 1 January 2011, builds on the provisions of the previous version and includes more detailed requirements, including the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  In that regard, the Central Bank has also published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears &lsquo;Mortgage Arrears &mdash; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&rsquo; and this is available on the Central Bank website.</P>
        <P>More recently, the Central Bank has also required licensed mortgage lenders to develop comprehensive strategies and implementation plans to deal with their individual mortgage arrears situations.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing these strategies and plans to ensure that they are addressing the problem and that mortgage lenders are looking at appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group report and other options that banks may develop themselves, for their customers who may have unsustainable mortgages.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders on the further development and implementation of these strategies and plans.</P>

        <P>I have no plans to introduce a type of Government-backed insurance scheme outlined by the Deputy.  The possible introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain flood insurance from insurance companies was examined in 2010.  However, at that time the Government concluded that such an approach was not financially viable.  In particular, there were concerns that, over time, such a scheme could incentivise the insurance industry to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas, thereby making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, that the OPW continues to liaise with the Irish Insurance Federation, to ensure that the Federation and its members have access to up-to-date information on flood protection measures.  The Minister of State has also advised me that he intends to arrange a meeting with representatives of the insurance industry early this year to provide a forum for the effective interchange of information and opinions in relation to flood risk management.</P>

        <P>The ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary published in November suggested that there is a lack of coordinated action in the euro area and the situation contains elements reminiscent of policy making during the Great Depression.  Since the start of the economic crisis, significant and bold policy actions have been undertaken by the ECB and by euro area Member States.  As a result, an outright depression has been avoided.</P>
        <P>The intensification of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis in recent months has called for additional action on our part and we have stepped up to this challenge.  For example, the ECB is providing unlimited three year liquidity.  The six pack of legislative reforms is another example.  Moreover, as part of the intergovernmental agreement reached on Monday, euro area Member States have committed to a new &ldquo;Fiscal Compact&rdquo;.  This will lead to enhanced budgetary and economic coordination and governance.  So progress is clearly being made.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 166 and 172 together.</P>
        <P>The independence of the European Central Bank is enshrined in the Treaty and in this context it is important that this be respected when commenting on such matters.  In terms of developments in recent months, I would highlight the key role that the ECB is already playing in addressing the crisis.  For instance, it is important to note the positive impact of measures announced in December to support bank lending and liquidity in the euro area money market.  In addition, secondary market purchases of the sovereign debt of vulnerable euro area Member States under the Securities Markets Programme have had a beneficial impact.</P>
        <P>In terms of the wider question regarding the resolution of the euro area crisis, my view is that we are now seeing concerted action to address the weaknesses that have become evident in the design of monetary union.  Retrofitting the single currency with the tools necessary to make it consistent with an economic union will be important in this regard.  Considerable progress has been made, including the so-called &ldquo;six-pack&rdquo; of legislative reforms as well as the agreement on a &ldquo;fiscal compact&rdquo; to ensure fiscal discipline in participating Member States.</P>
        <P>Secondly, we need to avoid difficulties in one Member State spreading to other Members States by erecting suitable financial firewalls.  There has been some considerable progress in this area, including the development of stabilisation mechanisms that would have been unthinkable only two years ago.</P>

        <P>The European Commission released its Autumn Economic Forecast on 10th November 2011.  The Commission believes that the global economy has moved to a lower growth trajectory and that real GDP growth in the EU came to a standstill around the end of 2011.  Only in the second half of 2012 is a return to economic growth expected.  GDP growth in 2011 is estimated at 1.5% in the euro area and 1.6% in the EU, and projected to be 0.5% and 0.6% respectively in 2012 and 1.3% and 1.5% in 2013.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the Commission&rsquo;s latest forecasts with my European colleagues.

        <P>As I have stated clearly in the past, if such a tax cannot be introduced on a global basis, I think it would be better if it were introduced on an EU-wide basis. This would prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.  Our major concern is that, if an FTT is introduced, it could affect the financial services industry, especially <Col N="365" />in the IFSC, and lead to some activities and jobs moving abroad.  If, as some countries have proposed, the tax was to be brought in under enhanced co-operation arrangements, we would fear we could lose business to London, since the UK is strongly opposed to this initiative.  In the past, certain financial activities moved to London when other countries enacted similar taxes.   The current draft proposal is still being discussed at EU Council Working Party level and will be considered again by the Council of Ministers later this year.  I have made clear our views, as has the Taoiseach, in discussion with our European colleagues.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Pillar is comprised of seventeen organisations representing the interests of people from many different sectors of society.    In addition, my Department received in the order of 700 submissions from organisations, groups and individuals. These were considered by officials in the context of Budget preparation.</P>

        <P>As set out in Budget 2012, my Department expects the unemployment rate to gradually decline as the economy recovers.   At present, the labour market is still in a weak state, as confirmed by the latest CSO Quarterly National Household Survey data.  The unemployment rate is unacceptably high and people are still losing jobs.  At the same time, some jobs are being created. Figures from the Department of Social Protection, show that 144,000 left the live register to take up employment last year.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May 2011, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, have played a role in this respect.  This view is shared by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, who only last week informed the House that a significant number of jobs were created in the tourism sector on foot of measures set out in the Jobs Initiative.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that improving labour market conditions represents its biggest challenge, and, accordingly, is giving top priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed.  In this regard, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation will soon publish an Action Plan on Jobs.</P>

        <P>In November last year, the European Commission published a Green Paper on the feasibility of introducing Stability Bonds.  The paper analyses the potential benefits and challenges of a number of approaches to common sovereign debt issuance among euro area Member States. In terms of process, the Commission is expected to indicate its views on the best way forward in mid-February, on the basis of the public consultation.</P>
        <P>While there are potentially significant benefits attached to common debt issuance, resistance from some Member States is clearly a factor.</P>
        <P>In terms of the stabilising role of the ECB, I would highlight the key role that the ECB is already playing in addressing the crisis.  For instance, it is important to note the positive impact of measures announced in December to support bank lending and liquidity in the euro area money market.  In addition, secondary market purchases of the sovereign debt of vulnerable euro area Member States under the Securities Markets Programme have had a beneficial impact.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>As of the European Council meeting last night, 25 of the 27 EU Member States signed up to an intergovernmental agreement.  The intention is to have the agreement signed in March.</P>
        <P>In these negotiations the Government at all times sought to protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests and also the jobs in the IFSC.  In particular, while it was not mentioned in the agreement, the Government&rsquo;s position is clear on the introduction of a Financial Transactions Tax.  We do not agree to such a tax being introduced except at a global level or at least by all 27 Member States of the European Union including the United Kingdom.  The Taoiseach reiterated this view during the recent British-Irish Council meeting in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I announced in my Budget speech that I intend to introduce a package of measures in the forthcoming Finance Bill to support the continued success of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  The sector employs more than 30,000 people and contributes over &euro;1 billion in tax to the Exchequer.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector was reaffirmed in the five year strategy for the industry which was launched by the Taoiseach in July last year.</P>

        <P>Deputy Martin will be aware that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, at a meeting on 11 January 2012 of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, explained to the Committee Revenue&rsquo;s approach to using data that the Commissioners received from the DSP on long-term pension payments.   The Chairman explained that Revenue&rsquo;s role is to collect the right amount of tax from all taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s evaluation of the data supplied by the Department of Social Protection was that, on aggregate, a material amount of additional tax was due from recipients of the relevant DSP pensions and Revenue had a responsibility to the State to secure that tax as quickly as possible.  It was further explained that Revenue&rsquo;s primary objective was to put matters right for 2012 and they had very little time to do that.  Deferring any action until some time in 2012 would have meant that arrears of tax would have built up for the taxpayers concerned.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners had to act quickly to ensure that the changes required to secure the additional taxes arising from the exchange of data with the DSP were implemented in time for the start of the 2012 tax year.  I am also satisfied that the purpose of sending letters out to different groupings was well intentioned and sought to explain how the inclusion of up-to-date figures from the DSP would affect taxpayers&rsquo; tax credits and rate bands.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has acknowledged that the letters caused confusion and distress to some people and apologised for any distress.  Revenue has and will continue to meet groups representing pensioners to get their views on how best to explain the whole area of the interaction of tax and pensions to their members.</P>
        <P>Revenue has a good track record in managing large projects in a sensible way while at the same time collecting the tax that the State needs and I am confident that they will on this occasion also.  The response by Revenue staff, in particular the quality of service Revenue staff provided, to the large number of pensioners who contacted them, has been commended by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

        <P>I have no plans to introduce consumer legislation into the area of mortgage rate reductions.    In late 2011 the Taoiseach asked for the Central Bank&rsquo;s opinion on recent developments in mortgage interest rates and on possible action by the Central Bank in that regard.  In response to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s request, the Deputy Governor wrote to him on 11 November 2011. In his letter the Deputy Governor stated that the Central Bank was not requesting the power to have regulatory control over the setting of retail interest rates given that this could absolve banks of their responsibility to price risk accurately.  He indicated that experience of such controls in the past and in other countries, did not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce the availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. Binding controls would have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors in the market. By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would especially during the recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs. In his letter, the Deputy Governor also said that within its existing powers, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 182 together.  </P>
        <P>The Jobs Initiative introduced last year brought forward a number of targeted sectoral measures and tax/PRSI changes designed to assist in employment generation, to provide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and thus generate confidence in the economy. These <Col N="369" />included a new second reduced VAT rate of 9% aimed primarily at the tourism sector, a halving of the employers PRSI rate until 2013, small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure aimed primarily at &lsquo;shovel-ready&rsquo; projects and increasing the number of available educational, training and up-skilling places.</P>
        <P>In order to fund the various measures, the Government introduced a temporary levy on funded pension schemes and personal pension plans. In 2011 this raised approximately &euro;463 million. Over the 2011-2014 period the Jobs Initiative will be budgetary neutral. It is the case however, that the pension levy was expected to generate a net gain to the Exchequer in 2011 as the yield was expected to more than offset the cost of the other measures introduced. The range of measures outlined in the Jobs Initiative for 2011 were projected to cost approximately &euro;400 million and these with the exception of the Air Travel Tax are being advanced or have already been put in place by the relevant implementing Department or agencies. In July last year, following input from the Minister for Transport, it was decided not to abolish the Air Travel Tax and to revisit the situation this Spring when further negotiations will take place with the airlines.</P>
        <P>The Government is currently finalising a comprehensive Action Plan for Jobs which will set out further measures to be taken in 2012 to support job creation.  This Action Plan, which complements last year&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative, will be published in the coming weeks.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the budgetary documentation which I provided to the House in December contains more up-to-date forecasts than the medium term fiscal statement. The unemployment rate is projected to fall over the coming years but to remain elevated.  For 2015, my Department is forecasting an unemployment rate of 11.6 per cent. This figure is a forecast as opposed to a target. It does not take account of policies which the Government is currently working on, such as the Action Plan on Jobs, which my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation will soon publish. I want to stress that the Government considers the labour market represents its biggest challenge and, accordingly, is giving top priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed.</P>

        <P>The standard VAT rate was increased in the budget from 21% to 23% as part of a general package of raising revenues measures to contribute to Exchequer funding and is in line with commitments made in the Programme for Government and in the EU/IMF Programme.  The &euro;670 million raised by this VAT increase will go some way towards funding other costs in Exchequer spending.</P>
        <P>As I said when I addressed the D&aacute;il in December, the Government carefully considered the various options open to us in terms of taxation. One of the key objectives of the Government is to get people back to work. Indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on economic activity and employment, which is why Budget 2012 focused on indirect taxes such as VAT rather than on income tax.</P>

        <P>In September 2011 the Government announced the establishment of the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA) within the NTMA and the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund.   NewERA will centralise the management of Government holdings in the commercial semi-state sector (initially the companies within NewERA&rsquo;s remit are ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte) from a shareholder perspective. This role, based on the Shareholder Executive model already established in a number of developed economies, will involve oversight of activities such as capital expenditure plans, corporate strategy, acquisitions and disposals. NewERA is already working closely with the relevant Government departments and companies in this regard. The Shareholder Executive approach is designed to provide the Government with a portfolio view of investment returns from the sector and with a means of assessing the likely impact of commercial developments in the sector on long-term Government investment plans. </P>
        <Col N="371" />
        <P>NewERA is also charged with assisting the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in<b></b>energy, water and next-generation<b></b>  telecommunications with the long-term objective of employment creation and has commenced work with the relevant Government departments in these areas.</P>
        <P>The Strategic Investment Fund will, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), channel commercial investment from the NPRF towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the Fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the Irish economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.</P>
        <P>In November 2011, the NPRF announced a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund are important elements in the Government&rsquo;s strategy to promote economic growth and create jobs.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to estimate the cost to the Irish economy in terms of employment due to tax evasion or avoidance. The measurement of the scale of tax evasion, often referred to as the shadow economy, is inherently difficult given the nature of the problem. There is no one internationally recognised and agreed measure, nor are there agreed measures to estimate the consequent cost to employment of the shadow economy.  There is no doubt that shadow economy activity and aggressive tax avoidance create distortions in the economy and competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses. For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems. </P>
        <P>Revenue fully recognises the need to tackle tax evasion in all its forms, and consequently has an increased focus on sectors that have the potential to operate using cash. Last year Revenue carried out 11,066 audits resulting in a yield of &euro;440.46 million.</P>
        <P>Revenue continues to identify and challenge aggressive tax avoidance schemes and unintended use of legislation that threaten tax yields and the perceived fairness of the tax system. In general, tax avoidance is tackled by reviewing and amending legislation where there are perceived loopholes and by challenging individual cases. The introduction of a Mandatory Disclosure Regime in January 2011, which placed obligations on Promoters of certain tax-avoidance transactions to disclose them to Revenue, is designed to act as an &ldquo;early warning system&rdquo; to help tackle such schemes.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Central Bank gathers and collates statistics on a wide range of Financial Services Sector activities on an on-going basis. As a general rule, my Department does not engage in a separate exercise to collect such statistics, but has access to and relies on statistics provided and published by the Central Bank.   Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was &euro;2.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2011.  Figures for the equivalent period in 2010 show drawdowns of &euro;2 billion.  Excluding SMEs in the property related sectors these figures show drawdowns of new lending of &euro;1.6 billion in the first 9 months of 2011, roughly equal to amounts drawn down in the first 9 months of 2010. Figures are not yet available for Q4 of 2011. For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the relevant statistics for credit made available to small business are accessible at:   <i>http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Documents/ie_Table_A.14.1_Credit_Advanced _to_Irish_Resident_Small_and_Medium_Sized_Enterprises.xls</i></P>
        <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of &euro;30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of &euro;16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks&rsquo; deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.</P>
        <P>The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets.</P>

        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question envisages a movement away from the current system of marking of oil to which a reduced rate of tax applies to one in which certain users would be given refunds of part of the mineral oil tax paid by them in respect of fuel used for non-auto purposes. This would, however, involve the establishment of an extensive repayments system, which would give rise to a significant administrative burden and costs for oil traders, users and Revenue, as well as posing significant cash-flow costs for those who currently use marked oil.  Moreover, repayment systems are vulnerable to abuse and would be likely to be targeted by criminal elements such as those currently involved in oil laundering. It has to be borne in mind also that, even if there were a move to a repayments system, those involved would still have the possibility of sourcing UK marked oil for laundering. A move away from marking could only be considered, therefore, if the UK were to do likewise.  For those reasons, it is not clear that a repayment system would be less susceptible to fraud. The intention, therefore, is to ensure that controls relating to the sale and distribution of oils, and enforcement action for combating laundering, are as effective as possible.</P>

          <i>Recognition of Foreign Qualifications Abroad</i>
        </P>

          <i>Recognition of Foreign Qualifications in Ireland</i>
        </P>
        <P>Individuals with Foreign trade qualifications must submit their qualification to the NQAI who will compare the foreign qualification to a qualification that is placed at a particular level on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications.</P>
        <P>The Irish Trade qualifications for craft-worker status have been placed on the Irish Framework of Qualifications at FETAC level 6 Advanced Certificate-craft.</P>
        <P>Individuals with trade specific international qualifications which have been ratified as lower than the FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate Craft, and who wish to attain a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate Craft through the Irish apprenticeship structure, must comply with the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          The person must be registered as an apprentice by a F&Aacute;S approved employer.</P>

        <P FLI="0">However, in some professions you do not need to have completed an apprenticeship to be allowed to work.  Motor Mechanic would be an example.  As it is not a regulated profession it is a matter for each employer to specify the qualifications of the individual to meet standards and regulations. A full list of regulated professions in Ireland is included in schedule 1 to the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (Directive 2005/36/EC) Regulations, 2008 and relevant authorities have processes in place for evaluating and recognising relevant qualifications and experience gained abroad for the purposes of allowing access to those professions.</P>

        <P>Arts education (visual arts, music and drama) is one of the seven curriculum areas that comprise the primary curriculum, which was revised in 1999. Therefore all primary school children have access to an arts programme.</P>
        <P>At second level there are approved syllabuses for Junior Certificate in Music and Art, Craft and Design. In the senior cycle there are syllabuses in Music and Art. Modules in the Arts are also available as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied. In the Transition Year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils&rsquo; interest in the Arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting curricular provision for the arts at primary and second level, my Department aids the arts through the provision of some 68,000 teaching hours to a number of schools of music operated by VECs and through co-operation (teaching) hours to VECs which support work with other institutions. In addition, two Music Education Partnerships are funded in Donegal and Dublin City VECs.</P>
        <P>A further initiative in Music for young people of school age has been launched by Music Generation, a subsidiary company of Music Network, supported by donations from U2 and the Ireland Funds. The programme is aimed at providing access to vocal and instrumental music education for children and young people.</P>
        <P>The Artists in School Guidelines, developed jointly by the Arts Council and my Department, and issued to all schools in 2006, are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 242 together.</P>
        <P>The Statistics Section of my Department&rsquo;s website contains extensive data at individual school level in county order.  The most recent information available relates to the 2010/2011 school year. Statistical information in respect of the current school year is currently being compiled in my Department and is due for publication in September 2012.</P>
        <P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools are published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s focus is on implementing the staffing arrangements for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert scarce staffing resources to deal with the individual type queries from the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.</P>

        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  Schools in the programme include both urban and rural primary schools and post-primary schools. Urban primary schools are categorised as serving areas with a population greater than 1,500, while the rural dimension serves areas with a population of less than 1,500.  Primary schools in the town referred to by they Deputy are considered urban.</P>
        <P>Measures under Budget 2012 relate to the withdrawal of certain posts under older disadvantage schemes that pre-date DEIS. Some urban primary schools have been adversely affected by these measures, as they retained teaching resources to implement more favourable class sizes from a number of previous disadvantaged schemes.</P>
        <P>I announced in the House on 11th January that my Department is to report to me within four weeks on the impact of the withdrawal of posts under these older schemes on DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 primary schools only.  The report will take account of the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools, for example increasing and decreasing enrolments and the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process, all of which will determine the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.</P>
        <Col N="376" />
        <P>It is only when this report is made available to me that I will be in a position to make a decision on the final outcome for the individual schools involved and finalise and publish the staffing schedules for 2012/2013.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>I fully acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools will be challenging for schools.  However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times.  The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. In the budget announcement for education I made clear that the net impact of the measures relating to second level schools for the school year commencing next September would, after taking account of demographics amount to about 450 posts.</P>
        <P>Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</P>
        <P>I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students.  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</P>
        <P>My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.</P>

Budget 2011 provided for a general reduction of 2% in per capita and related grants.  At primary level this will mean a reduction of &euro;7 per pupil in capitation rates, with a similar reduction in enhanced capitation rates for special schools and special classes.  The ancillary and book grants remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to three Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school, etc.</P>
        <P>With regard to the VEC sector financial allocations are made to VECs as part of a block grant. VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. Accordingly, my Department does not have available to it a details of the distribution of funds by County Dublin VEC to the second level schools it manages in Dublin 15.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants. There will be a reduction of &euro;11 in the capitation rate for voluntary secondary schools in 2012. All other per capita grants remain unchanged.  Castleknock College is a fee charging school in Dublin 15, and therefore does not receive current funding from my Department.  A proportionate reduction will be applied to funding allocations to the Community and Comprehensive School and the VEC sectors.</P>

        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS in 2005 was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC. The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in DEIS. Furthermore, an appeal mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.</P>
        <P>An ongoing evaluation of DEIS has been underway since the rollout of supports commenced in 2006. My Department commissioned the Educational Research Centre to undertake this evaluation, the aim of which is to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students and schools at primary and post primary levels.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Inspectorate of my Department conducted evaluations of planning in a sample of 36 DEIS schools, 18 primary and 18 post-primary. A national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post-primary schools has been completed and this report along with the ERC report have been published.</P>
        <P>My Department will fully consider these evaluation reports before any decisions can be made regarding the future of DEIS.  While a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage, the current economic climate and the challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure limits opportunities and means that there is no capacity to provide for additionality to the DEIS programme.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>Teachers who planned to retire before the end of February were required to give 3 months&rsquo; notice of their intention to retire in order to ensure that schools were aware of potential staffing difficulties.  While the minimum notice period was 3 calendar months, school management were advised to seek the cooperation of staff in giving the earliest possible notice of their intention to retire in order to facilitate resource planning and timetabling. In recognition of the additional pressure of students facing state examinations, and the concerns of teachers who wish to ensure continuity of support for these children I have made provision, for this year only, to reduce disruption to students undertaking examinations in June.  This is in the form of alleviation measures allowing post-primary schools to re-employ teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012 and who, immediately before their retirement, have been teaching students preparing to sit the Junior or Leaving Certificate examinations in 2012.</P>
        <P>These teachers may be re-employed until the summer holidays for the teaching duties for which they were timetabled immediately before their retirement. Where a teacher&rsquo;s pre-retirement duties included both teaching and non-teaching duties, such as in the case of an Assistant Principal or Deputy Principal, the teacher may be re-employed for his or her teaching hours only.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are a large number of qualified and registered teachers who are unable to source work at the current time. I am also very alive to the pressures our young people are under to perform well in their State exams. I believe that the approach being adopted strikes the right balance between the needs of students who face into significant examinations, the retiring teachers who have invested a huge amount of time and effort in preparing students for their examinations and those teachers who are looking forward to the opportunities presented by the increased level of retirements at a time of constrained resources. Vacancies left by retiring primary and post-primary teachers of non-exam classes may be filled in a temporary capacity for the remainder of the school year in accordance with the existing recruitment procedures.  I am confident that the large pool of qualified and registered teachers will be in a position to continue to provide high quality education to students.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 228 together.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to vacancies is not readily available in my Department.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I want to be very clear that vacancies created in the teaching profession by the forthcoming wave of public sector retirements up to February 29th 2012 will be filled. Students and pupils will not be left without teachers to teach them as a result of retirements. Furthermore, the turnover in teaching staff will provide many newly qualified teachers with opportunities to gain employment. The filling of vacancies in individual schools will be addressed by Boards of Management at school level. I am also seeking to reduce the impact of these retirements on students preparing for the State examinations. I am allowing schools to re-employ  teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012, and who had been teaching classes due to sit State exams in 2012, until the end of the school year. In the case of teachers who are not teaching exam classes, replacements can be employed until the end of the school year, subject to the numbers framework.</P>
        <P>The information available to the Pensions Unit of my Department  in relation to projected retirements nationally from 1 January 2012 to 29 February 2012 are of the order of 729 Primary teachers, 507 Secondary/Community and Comprehensive School teachers and 220 Vocational teachers.  A county  by county breakdown of these figures is not readily available.</P>
        <P>A key part of the Government&rsquo;s overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll. This will continue to be the case until we close the gap between what we spend as a country and what we take in through taxes. Given that one third of all public sector employees work in the Education sector it is simply not possible to completely exempt staffing levels in education from the Government&rsquo;s need to reduce expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework.  For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department&rsquo;s website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil&rsquo;s initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. It is <Col N="382" />the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries in relation to the child detailed in the question and understand that he was the subject of an educational psychological assessment through NEPS in the past year.  Should his parents have any concerns or queries in regard to the results of this process I would advise that they communicate them to the Principal of the school involved. The NEPS psychologist currently assigned to Levistown N.S. is available to provide any assistance or clarification to them in this connection.</P>

An Chomhairle was established to co-ordinate the provision of textbooks and aids to support Irish, to advise on policies relating to Irish in schools generally and in all-Irish and Gaeltacht schools, to provide support services through the medium of Irish and to undertake research in this area.</P>
        <P>An Chomhairle works closely with An G&uacute;m and other agencies to address the deficit in Irish medium resources and materials.

These resources will be expanded progressively over time. A complete list of Teaching Aids and Resources has also been sent to Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna, and a mobile library van provides demonstrations to schools of the resources available.</P>

        <P>A Master Plan for the site on which the proposed school, referred to by the Deputy, is to be constructed is currently being finalised. The production of the Master Plan is the first step in the process for the delivery of a primary, post primary and special school on the site. My Department is due to meet with the Local Authority in early February to discuss the Plan.  The outcome of the meeting will influence the delivery dates for all schools to be constructed on the site.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have previously committed to publishing shortly a five year plan outlining the school building projects to be constructed in that time.</P>

        <P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority.</P>
        <P>Reckonable income for student grants purposes is gross income from all sources.  Therefore, the assessing authorities use the profit or loss as shown by the statement of rental income and no allowance is made for the interest associated with rental income.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual&rsquo;s application form and supporting documentation, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student should qualify for a grant.  However, an applicant may appeal the decision of the grant awarding authority to its appeals officer. Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>The new simplified approach to the General Allocation Model of support for schools will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school. Schools will also have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.  The arrangements for the staffing allocation under the General Allocation Model (GAM) are specifically designed to facilitate GAM hours being clustered into full-time posts &mdash; either entirely within their own school or with a nearby neighbouring school.  The new GAM allocations are being done in 5-hour blocks which is the equivalent of the tuition time for a full school day.  Teachers that are in shared posts between schools can therefore operate local arrangements that enable their travel to a neighbouring school to be done, where possible, from the start of the school day thus avoiding loss of tuition time.</P>
        <P>As part of the reforms to the teacher allocation process existing posts will be used to put in place a network of about 2,450 full-time resource posts in over 1,600 base schools throughout the country that will be allocated on a permanent basis.  This approach builds on the interim arrangements that operated in 2011 but in a more structured and transparent manner.  The annual changes in resource hours at individual school level will only affect where the teacher is working on any one day &mdash; not whether the base school continues to host the full-time post.  This approach will introduce a greater constancy in the context of the annual allocations and redeployment process.</P>
        <P>The teachers in these full-time resource posts will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools.  Schools are typically notified of their NCSE approved resource hours in the late Spring/early Summer period but also throughout the school year.  Through his/her role in allocating resources the local SENO will have an oversight role in relation to the sharing arrangements between schools so that they can operate as efficiently as possible and any time loss due to travel between schools can be kept to a <Col N="386" />minimum.  Schools that are unable to access their NCSE approved resource hours from this network of full-time resource posts will be allocated mainly part-time temporary posts.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208, 219 and 245 to 251, inclusive, together.</P>
        <Col N="387" />
        <P>At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.  The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools.  It is worth noting that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland.  Over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far higher average class sizes than all of the schools affected by this measure.  For example a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for sixteen pupils.  In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.  It is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter and to realise the exceptionally favourable supports my Department will continue to provide for small schools.  For that reason, as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.  My Department&rsquo;s focus is on implementing the staffing arrangements for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert scarce staffing resources to deal with the individual type queries from the Deputies.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for preschool children with autism.  The child referred to by the Deputy has been allocated tuition until the end of the school year.  Separately the July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July.  Home based provision is also provided for under this scheme.  The child in question will also be eligible to apply for tuition under this scheme.</P>

The criteria under which National Schools are recognised by the Department are outlined in the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools.  Under the criteria, recognition can be withdrawn where a school&rsquo;s pupil enrolment returns to the Department, at 30th September, fall below eight pupils and remain at this level for at least two consecutive years and where the Patron is satisfied that there is little prospect of a reversal in the school&rsquo;s pupil enrolment trend.  The schools referred to by the Deputy currently meet the recognition criteria concerned.</P>

        <P>The following table provides a list of appointments made to bodies under the aegis of my Department since my appointment as Minister for Education and Skills for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.  It should be noted that Board appointments, while made by me, as Minister, are not in all cases made at my sole discretion. Individuals may be nominated for appointment by various organisations as specified in the relevant statute of the body concerned.  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department has recently corresponded with survivors groups seeking nominations for the new Board of the Education Finance Board (EFB).  This Board will effectively be a caretaker board which will serve for a number of months pending the establishment of the Statutory Fund.  It is envisaged that the new Fund will assume the functions of the Board and the Board will be dissolved when the fund is set up.</P>
        <P>In December 2011, in accordance with Government policy, expressions of interest were sought from suitably qualified and experienced persons for consideration for appointment to the following boards of Bodies operating under my Department aegis:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" /> L&eacute;argas Ltd &mdash; The Exchange Bureau</P>

        <Col N="390" />
        <P FLI="0">Interested applicants were advised to register an Expression of Interest through the Public Appointments Service (PAS).</P>
        <P>Vacancies on other Boards of Bodies under the aegis of the Department that arise during 2012 will be advertised on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Deputy should note that in making any direct Ministerial appointments, I am not necessarily confined to those who make such expressions of interest but will ensure that all of those appointed have the relevant qualifications for the positions.</P>

        <P>The most recent data for graduate employment in Ireland was published in 2010 and relates to 2008 graduates.  The full report &ldquo;What do graduates do?&rdquo; is available at <i>www.hea.ie</i>.  The data shows that the most common initial employment sector for holders of all awards in Ireland was Non-market services, which includes education and health sectors, with 45.3% of level 8 honours degree graduates; 89% level 9 postgraduate diploma graduates (more than half of which employed in secondary education); 76% of PhD graduates (almost half of which were employed in third level education sector) and 37.8% of taught masters Graduates employed in this sector.  A significant proportion of both honours degree and taught masters graduates also found employment in Business Finance and Insurance Services (22.3% and 23.2%, respectively).  This pattern is repeated in the sectoral distribution of graduates overseas with Non-Market sector as the most popular employment sector for the majority of graduates.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 240 together.</P>
        <Col N="393" />
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s policy in allocating this support.  My Department&rsquo;s Circular 0042/2011 notified school management authorities of the staffing arrangements which would apply in special schools in the 2011/12 school year.  The Circular set out that the 2010/11 level of teaching supports would be maintained in special schools for the 2011/12 school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments.  The Circular also indicated that the NCSE may suppress a teacher post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.</P>
        <P>The special school referred to by the Deputy currently has an enrolment of 18 pupils with a staffing allocation of 4 teachers and 12 Special Needs Assistants. Notwithstanding the fact that the pupils attending this school have very significant levels of need, this is a very high staffing level, with a total of 16 staff providing for 18 pupils at the school.  These enhanced pupil teacher and SNA ratios are provided to special schools to support them in dealing with pupil behaviour and individual educational and care needs.  In addition, it is open to schools to seek guidance and advice from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in relation to the establishment of whole-school procedures in this area.  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of health supports, including Physiotherapy, to children who require such support.</P>

        <P>Teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council and have fulfilled all conditions other than probation currently apply to Limerick Education Centre (LEC) for probation.  At present, inspection visits are conducted by the Department Inspectorate on behalf of the Teaching Council to evaluate the professional competence of the eligible teachers.  The Inspectorate provides the teacher with a statement indicating their level of competence.  It is the responsibility of the teacher to provide evidence of professional competence to the Teaching Council in order to become fully registered.  The records maintained in Limerick Education Centre indicate that 12 teachers listed for probation have declared themselves to be on Jobbridge and 3 teachers have declared themselves to be on F&Aacute;S work placement programme. </P>

        <P>I fully appreciate the importance of Physical Education in promoting positive well being, and mental and physical health in schools, and the role this plays in supporting student achievement.  However, curriculum overload has been found in many evaluations in the Irish system, and I do not intend to extend the length of time required for PE in primary or second level schools.  My focus is on ensuring that the time recommended for PE is implemented in all schools, as part of a broad and balanced programme, that schools encourage physical activity during breaks and seek to promote sport<Col N="394" />ing activities outside of school time, and make their premises and facilities available to the wider community.</P>
        <P>In addition to PE being a required subject in all schools, the importance of healthy lifestyles, good nutrition and physical exercise is also featured as part of the Social Personal and Health Education Programme which is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle.  In a new school building or major refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment is provided.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has recently completed a public consultation process on a syllabus for Physical Education as a Leaving Certificate examinable subject, and will be forwarding its advice to me during 2012.  However, there are a range of syllabuses awaiting implementation which cannot be progressed in the current budgetary climate.  In Junior cycle, PE is a non-examinable subject.  As part of the reforms which I have recently endorsed, there will be opportunity for schools to provide short courses which are locally developed, of 100 hours duration, which are assessed by means of a portfolio.  There will be scope under these arrangements for schools to extend the provision for sports and PE should they wish to do so.</P>
        <P>It is important to realise that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school and so their level of physical activity during the rest of the week in just as important.  Indeed, the &lsquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children 2010&rdquo; report found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across 40 countries in being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day on more than 4 days per week.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy was advised in relation to previous requests for information on various university costs, information of this nature is generally not readily available.  Furthermore, given differences in management and financial information systems across the seven universities, it is difficult to collect consistent, comparable data.

        <P>The National Strategy for Higher Education sets out an approach to the development of the system that is based on building strength through collaboration while retaining and fostering mission diversity across institutions.  My Department and the Higher Education Authority, in partnership with our higher education institutions, are now together implementing the wide ranging reforms set out in the strategy.  An element of the reforms, currently under consultation, includes the development of regional clusters of institutions, which would be characterised by close co-ordination and co-operation between various types of independent higher education institutions that together would determine and meet the needs of a wide range of students, communities and enterprises in their region.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA.  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries in relation to the student detailed in the question and can inform the Deputy that the school which she attends currently is assigned a NEPS psychologist.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil&rsquo;s initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above.</P>
        <P>I would suggest that the parents of the student in question should discuss the matter with the school Principal who will advise them as to the appropriateness of a referral in this instance and the process for accessing same.</P>
        <P>Additionally students with permanent or long-term conditions, including visual and hearing difficulties, or specific learning difficulties, which they believe will significantly impair their performance in the Junior or Leaving Certificate examinations may apply to the State Examinations Commission (SEC) for a reasonable accommodation to be made to facilitate them taking the examinations.   The reasonable accommodations are intended to:</P>
        <Col N="406" />
        <P LI="1">(a) remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate&rsquo;s performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment and</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) ensure that, whilst giving candidates every opportunity to demonstrate their level of attainment, the special arrangements will not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Again I would advise that the student&rsquo;s parents raise, with the school Principal, the potential or appropriateness of submitting an application to the SEC in this instance.</P>
        <P>Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they raise the matter with their assigned NEPS psychologist for advise or clarification (NEPS Southern Regional Office, Tel: 021-4536358).</P>

        <P>The Government decided on taking office in March 2011 to reduce the salaries of An Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ministers of State with immediate effect.  The reductions were implemented on a voluntary basis by all relevant Officeholders pending passage of the necessary legislation giving statutory effect to the reductions.  Section 6(c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 gave a legislative basis to the pay reductions for Office holders from 1 January 2012. </P>
        <P>The effect of these reductions is that the gross annual salary of An Taoiseach has been reduced by nearly 30%, from &euro;285,583 in December 2009 to &euro;214,187 in January 2011 to &euro;200,000 in March 2011.  The gross annual salary of the T&aacute;naiste has been reduced by nearly 25% from &euro;245,325 in December 2009 to &euro;197,486 in January 2011 to the current rate of &euro;184,405, that of a Minister by nearly 25% from &euro;225,196 in December 2009 to 181,283 in January 2011 to &euro;169,275 and that of a Minister of State by nearly 16% from &euro;154,740 in December 2009 to &euro;139,266 in January 2010 to the current rate of &euro;130,042.</P>

However, the actual amounts or proportions involved remain to be agreed within the context of a final agreement on the overall scale and composition of the programme to be pursued.

        <P>These visitor statistics relate to times when sites are manned by OPW Guide Services (Mar./Apr. to Sept., at many sites).  The total number of visitors is, therefore, understated, as a lot of tourists visit a number of these sites in the off season.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>As indicated in my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 40637 on 15th December last, No. 3118 on 19th January and No. 3848 on 24th January this year, I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to the Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance.</P>
        <P>The Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance is provided for in the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Act, 1938, as amended by the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
        <P>The allowance is paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party in relation to expenses arising from the parliamentary activities, including research, of the party. Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election, or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent bye-election was elected as a member other than as a member of a qualifying party, i.e. an Independent Member.  Such qualifying <Col N="412" />Independent TDs are entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152.  A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment of &euro;23,383 for Independent Senators</P>
        <P>The annual amounts paid in respect of each Independent TD since 2001, as requested by the Deputy, are set out below at Appendix 1.  The allowances are generally payable monthly in arrears into a bank account specified by the beneficiary of the allowance.  The Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance is not subject to tax.</P>
        <P>The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The Act prescribes 11 different categories of expenditure, including research, which are regarded as expenses arising from parliamentary activities for the purposes of entitlement to the allowance.  These are set out at Appendix II. The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.</P>
        <P>The 2001 Act gives a statutory oversight role in relation to the Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance to the Standards in Public Office (SIPO) Commission.  This requires each party leader to prepare a statement of expenditure for the allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor&rsquo;s report to the Commission.  Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report to the Minister in relation to the use of the Party Leader&rsquo;s Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas.  Allowances paid to Independent members are not subject to these oversight provisions.  Any changes to the matters prescribed in the Act require primary legislation.</P>

        <P>The Government is committed to reducing Public Service numbers to 282,500 by 2015. Given the importance of meeting this challenging numbers target, any recruitment will be limited and targeted towards areas of most need.  It is not the general policy to comment on specific offices until decisions on business cases have been made. </P>
        <P>I reiterate what I have stated previously to the Deputy, that the Commissioner of Valuation is examining options to speed up the valuation process, including the introduction of a Self Assessment approach to valuation, accompanied by appropriate controls, and outsourcing some of the work.  As well as helping to speed up the national programme, an element of outsourcing, if it proves practicable, would allow comparison of the Valuation Office productivity and costs with those in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The enabling provisions to allow for these changes are included in proposals for amending legislation which were approved by Government on 6th December, 2011 and are now with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office for drafting of the proposed Valuation (Amendment) Bill. Preparatory work is continuing in drawing up the detailed schemes and, subject to the enactment of the legislation and availability of the necessary resources, I understand that the intention would be to initiate pilot revaluations using the self-assessment and outsourcing options in two local authority areas.</P>
        <P>As a further means of speeding up the revaluation programme generally and to accelerate the necessary capture of data on properties throughout the country, in advance of the roll-out to particular areas, a dedicated data-capture unit is being set up.  The Valuation Office is also looking for applicants under the JobBridge scheme being sponsored by the Department of Social Protection.</P>

It is understood that the city council will soon commence the planning process for the scheme through Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations, which will involve public consultation in relation to the proposals.</P>
        <P>Subject to a successful outcome to the planning process, it is expected that works could commence in the latter part of this year.  The Office of Public Works will undertake the works on behalf of the council once planning approval has been obtained. It is expected that works would be completed within twelve months of commencement.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The appointments were not made using the new procedures and the previous Chairman was reappointed to the role on the new board.</P>
        <P>The reason for not following the new procedures in relating to board appointments is that the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in consultation with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence) should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service.</P>
        <P>The Board is meant to be representative of its client base i.e. (Government Departments and Public Service Bodies).  The majority of the board are therefore   civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  There is also a union representative nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).  I reappointed the outgoing Chairman.</P>
        <P>I approved the appointment of the two external members because of their expertise in strategic change and public service recruitment respectively.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 to 272, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>In Budget 2001, the Minister for Finance allocated &euro;12.7m for the provision of cr&egrave;ches for the children of civil servants.  The allocation was part of a major initiative by the Government to improve childcare provision and increase the number of child care places available.  At that time, the absence of quality child care places which restricted the participation of women in the labour force had been identified as a constraint on Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.  The provision of child care places was identified as an important mechanism for mobilising under utilised labour resources.</P>
        <P>Over the following seven years, seven cr&egrave;ches were taken over or completed under the Child care Initiative.  The seven cr&egrave;ches are located in Athlone, Celbridge (Backweston), Cork, Ennis, Sligo and Dublin (Mount Street and Marlborough Street).  There are three different private operators responsible for running the cr&egrave;ches.  Contracts to these operators were awarded following tender processes.  The cr&egrave;ches can accept the children of staff working in the wider public service also.</P>
        <P>The Initiative was the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review which was published in November 2008.  Arising from this review, work on pursuing additional cr&egrave;ches under the auspices of the Initiative ended.</P>
        <P>The fees charged by the cr&egrave;ches are paid by parents directly to the private operators.  Responsibility and related current funding for the maintenance of civil service cr&egrave;che buildings rests with the Office of Public Works (OPW).  My Department retains the responsibility for any policy issues relating to the cr&egrave;ches and chairs the Board of the Initiative.  The Board also has representatives from the OPW, the Department of Children and the Civil Service Unions.</P>
        <P>My Department is in discussion with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the implications of the relevant benefit in kind taxation provisions and the arrangements that need to be made in order to comply with the relevant provisions of the 2011 Finance Act and will communicate the outcome to all Government Departments.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 to 275, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>It was a requirement of the Tender for these works that the Main Contractor appoint a registered Archaeologist to monitor all excavation works, incorporating the cost of this engagement in his overall fixed tender price.  The Main Contractor appointed for these works was Clonmel Enterprises Ltd. who engaged Valerie J. Keeley Ltd., as the Archaeological Consultants for this project.</P>
        <P>When the archaeological issue was encountered, located on the site of the two ponds at the outer extremes of the original Star Fort, there was an immediate referral to the National Monuments Service (NMS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Under the direction of Valerie J. Keeley Ltd., Clonmel Enterprises Ltd. was required to extract all materials from the two identified areas. Archaeologists from Valerie J. Keeley Ltd. undertook the Archaeological Investigation of the area which constituted examination of the silky clay surrounds of the Star Fort and of the extracted materials in compliance with the Ministerial Licence that had to be obtained on foot of this discovery.  The estimated cost of the archaeological investigation is &euro;23,195.</P>
        <P>Heavy rainfall and the presence of natural springs in certain areas of the road, gave rise to an unacceptable level of water retention in the foundation levels of stretches of the road.  Additional excavation and remedial drainage measures were necessary.  This, and the aforementioned reconciliation of the unforeseen archaeology, are responsible for the delay to date.  Final completion is expected shortly but is dependent on favourable weather conditions for the laying of bitumen/tarmacadam.</P>

        <P>The individual retired from the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in 2010 under the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme and will reach normal retirement age in March of this year.  The Deputy may wish to note that the officer was a Civil Servant and not a direct employee of a Member of the Oireachtas or of a Minister/Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Following my reply to Question No. 251 on 24 January, I have since been informed that, under the terms of the Public Sector Transfer Network as they apply in this particular case, the organisation in question is not obliged to make a contribution towards the retirement <Col N="423" />benefits of the individual in question because the transfer is deemed to be a pre-operative date transfer.</P>
        <P>Every organisation in the Transfer Network has its own &lsquo;operative date&rsquo; which is usually the date the organisation was designated as an &lsquo;approved organisation&rsquo; for the purpose of Section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963.  When it comes to an individual transfer case, the provisions of the Network state that the case must be categorised as being either a pre-operative date or a post-operative date transfer.  Such categorisation is determined by the later of the operative dates of the two organisations involved.  If the person left the first organisation before that date, the case is deemed to be pre-operative; if s/he left after the operative date, the case is a post-operative one.  The scheme provides that organisations are obliged to accept post-operative date transfers, but may refuse to accept those which are pre-operative.  However, where an organisation decides to accept a pre-operative date transfer, the scheme states that the former organisation is not obliged to make a contribution to the second organisation.  The Civil Service accepts all pre-operative date transfers even though it may not receive a contribution from the previous organisation.</P>

        <P>My Department has responsibility for the career break scheme for civil servants, which is governed by Circular 18/1998.

Accordingly, career break requests are entirely a matter for the local authority manager concerned.</P>

        <P>The Government is committed to a programme of public service reform and improvement.  As part of the work <Col N="424" />in this area, we are looking at classifications and listings of State Agencies in order to produce more coherent and focused directories of services for citizens and the Oireachtas. </P>
        <P>Broadly the position is that there are firstly a number of offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group.  The list of such bodies is set out at Appendix 1.</P>
        <P>Secondly there are non-commercial state bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department.  A list of such bodies is set out at Appendix 2.</P>
        <P>Beyond that within each Department there would be many other executive offices, divisions and directorates, operational or consultative groupings, task groups or forums that exist for various purposes that might or might not meet the definition of &lsquo;entity&rsquo;.  Many of these groups are transient in nature in response to the needs and business pressures of particular Departments and sectors and details of which would not be held centrally.  Questions on such bodies should be directed to the relevant Ministers.  The internal organisation of my own Department is set out at Appendix 3.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">Some background information may be useful in appreciating the context of the proposed legislative instrument.  The EU provided in the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC for exemptions from liability for copyright infringement for intermediary service providers in cases of mere conduit, caching and hosting, upon certain conditions.  This was to provide a framework for the development of e-commerce and telecommunication industries. Although such providers are thus free from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC (as allowed for in the e-Commerce Directive) provides that rights holders must be in a position to apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.</P>
        <P>A High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, for a member of the European Union, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has been decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment.</P>
        <P>In granting such injunctions the Courts must take account of various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  EU law has held that copyright is not an absolute right but must be balanced with other rights protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, on 24 November 2011, clearly laid out these principles that will guide all national courts in future (Case C-70/10-SABAM).</P>
        <P>These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 291 together.</P>
        <P>In relation to the scenario the Deputy has outlined, it is important to mention that copyright holders will not have power to compel the intermediary as stated.  The copyright owner will have the right to apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary in respect of works in which he holds the copyright.</P>
        <P>The proposed Statutory Instrument allows for the possibility of applying for an injunction only in respect of a particular works.  This would have to be considered by a court in its deliberations on the granting of an injunction against an intermediary.  Furthermore, all rem<Col N="429" />edies contemplated must be proportionate, as required by the Copyright Directive, and take into account the various judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area.  It is important to note that following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies to the court when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, including: Protection of personal data,  Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and right to property.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It is not a matter of believing or suspecting piracy or simply hosting copyright material. It must be shown that the services in question are used to infringe copyright.</P>
        <P>The legislation proposed is a restatement of the situation that was thought to pertain prior to the EMI &amp; ors v UPC judgment in October 2010.  It is required in order to clarify Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with Art 8(3) of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.</P>

        <Quest> if he will outline proposals for amending legislation regarding copyright holders to compel Internet service providers to block access to websites that they believe are engaged in piracy or hosting copyrighted material; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
        <P>An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  </P>
        <P>Under the proposed legislative measure, an order may be sought by copyright holders only in relation to their own works.  Any order against an intermediary will be subject to a judicial process.  This must involve due consideration of the rights of other persons likely to be affected, such as internet service providers and consumers.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has the same status as a Treaty when implementing EU law, must be considered.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that this must be interpreted in a way which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality.  These rights include the right to intellectual property, the important and fundamental human right of protection of private data, the equally important human right of freedom of expression and information and also the right to conduct a business.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. It is not a matter of believing or suspecting piracy or simply hosting copyright material.  It must be shown that the services in question are used to infringe copyright.</P>

        <P>Decisions relating to the closure of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s overseas offices are day-to-day operational matters for IDA Ireland in which I have no function.</P>
        <P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that the decision to close its Taiwan office, which it shared with Enterprise Ireland, on 31 December, 2011 was solely based on business reasons and that annual savings of &euro;30,000 will result.  The Agency has indicated that there have been no new IDA investment projects from Taiwan for several years despite the Agency&rsquo;s pursuit of an active marketing programme in the country during that time.  It appears that many Taiwanese companies are now focussed on targeting the vast Chinese market, which has been to the detriment of investment in other regions, such as Europe.  This is largely due to the enhanced political and economic co-operation between Taiwan and China in recent years.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has assured me that, while it will not have an office in Taiwan, it will continue to serve the Taiwan market from its base in Shanghai.</P>

        <P>Under its Horizon 2020 Strategy, which covers the period 2010-2014, IDA Ireland aims to secure 640 investments and create 62,000 direct jobs.  The aim is to achieve 50% of these investments in locations outside Dublin and Cork and to transform the existing FDI base across the country to develop, retain and grow employment in existing client companies operating here.  Central to IDA&rsquo;s strategy is to build on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, while optimising regional spread, in line with the National Spatial Strategy.  </P>
        <P>In the context of achieving successful implementation of its strategy, IDA Ireland continues to maximise efficiency through increasing the organisation&rsquo;s focus on business generation/client facing activities, which will ultimately benefit all regions.  During 2010, a Business Transformation Process was carried out which examined every position in the organisation.  The outcome provided opportunities to free up staff resources for core business generation activities and needs to ensure that IDA meets its job targets.</P>
        <P>In the North West Region IDA had two offices both conducting similar regional activities.  Following the Business Transformation Process, it was decided that Regional activities for the North West Region as a whole would continue to be carried out from the Sligo Office where the Regional Business and Relationship Manager for the North West Region, who was appointed in December last,  is now based.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Letterkenny office remains open and the two staff employed there have been assigned new roles and responsibilities focusing on frontline client activities on a national basis.  The aim of these measures is to win more business for Ireland and to ensure that IDA focuses on delivering 50% of investments outside Dublin and Cork, prioritising Gateway locations including Letterkenny and Sligo in the North West.</P>
        <P>Under the National Spatial Strategy, Letterkenny is one of 9 Gateway locations and will continue to be a key location of focus for the winning of foreign direct investments.  The North <Col N="431" />West Region has 36 IDA client companies employing over 5,300 people.  Indeed, Letterkenny had 2 key client announcements last year with the 200 person expansion of United Health Group, who now employ over 400 people, and Zeus, who expanded their manufacturing facility and will create 75 additional jobs.  Examples of other client companies in Letterkenny are Pramerica with 800 employees; Sita, 90 employees; Medisize, 140 employees and Abbot with 140 employees.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to work closely with all of its existing client companies in the region as well as promoting the region, and especially the Gateway locations of Letterkenny and Sligo, for new Foreign Direct Investment.</P>

        <P>A consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument. More than 50 submissions were received.  Some were from rights holders such as songwriters, authors and their representatives.  Others were from telecom companies and businesses that carry out intermediary activities on the internet and still more were from bodies concerned with freedom of expression and data protection issues.  </P>
        <P>I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  Legal advice, which was received with some submissions, was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.  Following this, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion and advice of the Attorney General, it is felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI &amp; ors v UPC case.  This is required in order to clarify Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with Art 8(3) of the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies to court deliberations when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, including: Protection of personal data,  Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and the right to property.  Any remedy must also be proportionate and follow the principles in this area laid down by the Court of Justice of the European Union.</P>

        <P>A consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed Statutory Instrument amending Section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an <Col N="432" />excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  Legal advice, which was received with some submissions was forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.  Following this, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion and advice of the Attorney General, it is felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI &amp; ors v UPC case.  This is necessary to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the EU Copyright Directive.</P>
        <P>The proposed Statutory Instrument allows for the possibility of applying for an injunction only in respect of a particular work.  This would have to be considered by a court in its deliberations on the granting of an injunction against an intermediary.  Furthermore, all remedies must be proportionate, and following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies to courts when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter including: Protection of personal data,  Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business, Right to property and Consumer Protection.</P>
        <P>Specific exemptions in relation to parody and satire are not prescribed in the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  The introduction of such exemptions are being considered by the Copyright Review Committee, whose first consultation paper is expected in February.  The Committee is also examining the &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; doctrine.</P>

        <P Just="Left">An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  A public consultation in relation to the content of a draft legislative measure in this regard was held.  This received wide publicity at the time.  In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Assoc of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Ltd, Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Ltd, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, IDA, IMIR, International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Provides Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone, X-tra Vision. Over 50 written submissions were received.</P>

        <P>Under its Horizon 2020 Strategy, which covers the period 2010-2014, IDA Ireland aims to secure 640 investments and create 62,000 direct jobs.  The aim is to achieve 50% of these investments in locations outside Dublin and Cork and to transform the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) base across the country to develop, retain and grow employment in existing client companies operating here.  Central to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to build on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, while optimising regional spread, in line with the National Spatial Strategy.  </P>
        <P>In the case of County Kerry, IDA Ireland markets the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry for new inward investment.  In addition, IDA actively promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client queries.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the South West Region is to:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Market the Region to overseas clients in order to secure new investments;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Support the growth and development of the Region&rsquo;s existing clients by working with them to transform their business in the region to create additional employment and sustainability; and,</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Ensure that the supporting infrastructure is in place to attract FDI.</P>
        <P FLI="0">IDA Ireland has indicated that Kerry has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing for FDI. However, over recent years, it has proved challenging to maintain and attract overseas <Col N="434" />manufacturing companies into the County as much of this investment globally is going to low cost destinations such as Eastern and Central Europe and China.  The challenge for the agency is to work with existing clients in order to transform their business to create additional employment and sustainability. IDA Ireland has informed me that, at the end of 2011, there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry   employing circa 1,300 people. The Agency has assured me that it will continue to market all available land and buildings in the County, including its 12 acre Business and Technology Park in Killarney and Kerry Technology Park in Tralee, which is owned and managed by Shannon Development in partnership with the Institute of Technology, for the purpose of attracting new clients to the county.</P>

        <P>
          <i>Forf&aacute;s</i>
        </P>
        <P>Mr John Murphy, Secretary General of the Department was appointed to the Board of Forf&aacute;s with effect from 18th  January 2012.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Development legislation provides that the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) serves on the board of Forf&aacute;s.  Professor Mark Ferguson therefore became a member of the Forfas Board on taking up his position with SFI with effect from 18th January 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new procedures were not utilized in the case of either appointment.  The SFI post is an ex officio appointment provided for in legislation.  It has been the custom to appoint the Secretary General of the Department to the board of Forf&aacute;s for reasons of policy cohesion and corporate governance.</P>
        <P>
          <i>National Standards Authority of Ireland Board (NSAI)</i>
        </P>
        <P>Helen Curley, a Principal Officer in my Department, was appointed on 8 July 2011.  Ms Curley resigned from the Board on 15 November 2011, as due to an internal transfer she was no longer responsible for the NSAI policy area.</P>
        <P>
          <i>National Consumer Agency</i>
        </P>
        <P>Ms Isolde Goggin was appointed to the Board of the National Consumer Agency in November 2011.</P>
        <P>While this appointment was not made using the new procedures Ms Goggin&rsquo;s appointment as Chairperson of the Competition Authority and CEO designate of the new body which will be established on foot of the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the rationalisation of State agencies.</P>
        <P>
          <i>PIAB</i>
        </P>
        <P>Two appointments were made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).</P>
        <P>One was the re-appointment of Ms Ann Fitzgerald in her capacity as Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency, which is a statutory position on the Board.  Therefore the post was not advertised.</P>
        <P>In the case of the second appointment, it was considered appropriate to have a representative from the Department on the Board and Ms Breda Power, Assistant Secretary, was appointed. Given the nature of this appointment, the post was not advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>
          <i>Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority</i>
        </P>
        <P>Seven appointments were made to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA).  Mr. Dave Martin and Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Donovan were both appointed as Nominees of the Prescribed Accountancy Bodies on the 26 May 2011.  Ms Sylvia McNeece of the Irish Pension Board, Ms Deirdre Behan of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Mairead Devine, of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and Mr. Sean Hawkshaw of the Central Bank were all appointed as Nominees of the Designated Bodies on the 3rd January 2012.</P>
        <P>As these appointments were made in compliance with the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 it was not appropriate to advertise the posts.</P>
        <P>
          <i>IDA</i>
        </P>
        <P>I have recently made the following two appointments to the Board of the IDA:</P>
        <P>Alan W. Gray and Mary Campbell.</P>
        <Col N="436" />
        <P>Neither appointment was made using the new procedures.  In this respect, the Deputy will be aware that Government policy is to introduce greater transparency in the appointment process.  In line with this policy and in an effort to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards, I sought expressions of interest last summer from suitably qualified people for appointment to the boards of several agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit.  I made it clear in advertising those vacancies that I would not be restricted to only those who responded to the advert.  I intend to launch another expressions of interest campaign in the near future in respect of further vacancies that have arisen or that are due to arise over the coming months.  In this respect, my overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments. In making appointments I will have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
        <P>The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, ACTA, to which the Deputy is referring, is an international legal framework to more effectively combat the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods.  As you are aware, counterfeiting and piracy are now serious problems which undermine legitimate trade and the sustainable development of the world economy.  The growth of this illegal trade has led the ACTA participants to agree to develop an instrument that will strengthen international co-operation regarding this serious development.</P>
        <P>ACTA is an agreement about the enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights.  It does not oblige any of its EU signatories to create new substantive rights or to change existing ones.  It only commits its EU signatories to ensure that the right holders can fully assert their rights if, when and where they exist.  The ACTA provisions are compatible with existing EU law.  Therefore, it will not require any revisions or adaptation of EU law and will not require any Member States to review the measures or instruments by which they implement relevant EU law.</P>
        <P>My Department has consulted the relevant Departments affected by ACTA and the Office of the Attorney General to ascertain compliance of Irish legislation with the provisions of ACTA.  It is not expected that there will be a need to amend current Irish legislation.  However, before ratifying ACTA, my Department will again confirm with all relevant Departments of State and with the Office of the Attorney General,<b></b>that all legislative and administrative requirements are in place to enable Ireland to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement.</P>
        <P>The Directorate General for Trade organised a stakeholder consultation exercise in both 2009 and 2010.  My Department, through advertisements on its website invited interested stakeholders to take part on both occasions. For the 2010 exercise, details regarding the stakeholder consultation exercise were also advertised on the Patent&rsquo;s Office website.  In addition, my Department wrote to a wide range of stakeholders to invite them to take part in the exercise.  My Department has also provided information regarding ACTA on its website, including the final text of the Treaty.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the EU and its Member States cannot conclude the Agreement without the consent of the European Parliament.  The Parliament&rsquo;s International Trade Committee is reviewing the Agreement, and is expected to make a decision on whether to approve it in April or May. A final plenary vote is tentatively scheduled for June.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware the judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI &amp; ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU <Col N="438" />law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  Following a public consultation process which was conducted by my Department, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion of the Attorney General, it was felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI &amp; ors v UPC case.  This is necessary to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the EU Copyright Directive.  It is for this reason that a legislative instrument is proposed.</P>
        <P>I wish to state that no policy change is proposed in the Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the High Court judgment in <i>EMI Ireland &amp; others versus UPC.  </i>  Accordingly, the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument has been framed in a manner which merely gives effect to the wording of the EU Copyright Directive (i.e. Article 8(3) of 2001/29/EC) rather than extending its scope beyond that of intermediaries.</P>
        <P>The intended purpose of the proposed Statutory Instrument is not to enact new EU legislation but rather it seeks to merely restate the position that was thought to exist in the Copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton&rsquo;s judgment here and in all EU Member States.  Accordingly, the introduction of this measure by way of Statutory Instrument is not inconsistent with the legislative policy outlined in the Programme for Government.</P>

        <P>Some background information may be useful in appreciating the context of the proposed legislative instrument.  The EU provided in the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC for exemptions from liability for copyright infringement for intermediary service providers in cases of mere conduit, caching and hosting, upon certain conditions.  This was to provide a framework for the development of e-commerce and telecommunication industries.  Although such providers are thus free from civil and criminal liability in certain circumstances, the EU Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC (as allowed for in the e-Commerce Directive) provides that rights holders must be in a position to apply for injunctions against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right. </P>
        <P>The High Court judgment (in the case of EMI &amp; ors v UPC) held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  My Department had considered that injunctions were available under Section 40(4) of the Copyright Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment.</P>
        <P>A High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, for a member of the European Union, non-compliance with EU law is a serious matter.  For the avoidance of doubt, it has been decided to introduce a Statutory Instrument to restate the position that was considered to pertain prior to this judgment.</P>

        <P>An issue arose following a High Court judgment in October 2010 where it was stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under the Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to internet transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8(3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.  A public consultation in relation to the content of a draft legislative measure in this regard was held.  This received wide publicity at the time.  In addition to a web-based consultation and liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Assoc of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Ltd, Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Ltd, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, IDA, IMIR, International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Provides Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone, and X-tra Vision.  Following the consultation, I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware the judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI &amp; ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  A public consultation process seeking comments from interested parties on the content of a proposed legislative amendment to the Copyright and Related Rights Act, by means of a Statutory Instrument, was conducted over last June and July.  More than 50 submissions were received and these submissions were afforded careful consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to liaising with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the consultation document was forwarded to bodies such as the Assoc of Trademark and Patent Attorneys, BT Communications Ireland Ltd, Consumers Association of Ireland, Digital Rights Ireland, Eircom, EMI Music Ireland Ltd, Enterprise Ireland, Google, Hinkson Solicitors, IBEC, IDA, IMIR, International Software Federation of Europe, Internet Service Provides Association of Ireland, Irish Copyright Licensing Agency, IRMA, Law Society of Ireland, Microsoft Ireland, O2, UPC, Vodafone, and Xtra Vision.  Following the consultation, <Col N="440" />I had meetings with representatives from many of the above bodies including, ISPs, rightsholders and consumers.  The submissions and input from all those concerned has been carefully considered and has proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved including the relevant issues raised from the perspective of companies operating within this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that no policy change is proposed in the Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the High Court judgment in <i>EMI Ireland &amp; others versus UPC.  </i>The legislation proposed is a restatement of the situation that was thought to pertain prior to this judgment.</P>
        <P>Going back to 22 December, 2002, the date by which every EU Member State had to have implemented Directive 2001/29/EC, every EU country has had to &ldquo;ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by third parties to infringe a copyright or related right&rdquo;.  Having that provision enshrined in EU law and the laws of Member States for a decade has not restricted the development of the Internet or innovative internet companies.  On the contrary, the Internet has flourished.</P>

        <P>The judgment of the High Court in the case of EMI &amp; ors v UPC held that by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and that Ireland did not comply with EU law.  As you will appreciate, non-compliance with EU law is a very serious matter.  Following a public consultation process which was conducted by my Department, and taking all matters into account, including the opinion of the Attorney General, it was felt necessary that there should be a restatement of the situation which was considered to pertain in Irish law in relation to injunctions against intermediaries prior to the judgment in the EMI &amp; ors v UPC case.  This is necessary to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the EU Copyright Directive.</P>
        <P>This Directive and the Court of Justice of the European Union require that all remedies must be proportionate and that the right of freedom of expression and the right to conduct a business must be balanced with the right to intellectual property in considering the granting of an injunction.  The Deputy will be aware that since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must apply when implementing EU law.  This means that in considering the grant of an injunction, a court must balance the intellectual property right with the other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter which include: Protection of personal data, Freedom of expression and Information, Freedom to conduct a business and the right to property.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the proposed Statutory Instrument provides that the owner of the copyright in a work may, in respect of that work, apply to the High Court for an injunction against an intermediary to whom paragraph 3 of Article 8 of Directive 2001/29/EC applies.  The right of appeal in respect of any injunction granted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed Statutory Instrument would lie to the Supreme Court.</P>

        <P>I am developing a Microfinance Loan Fund to provide loans to the microenterprise sector.  It is targeted at start-<Col N="445" />up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises across all industry sectors, employing not more than 10 people.  This Fund will provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.</P>
        <P>The proposed delivery structure of the Microfinance Loan Fund is being designed in close consultation with the Department of Finance, and is being progressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The Government recently approved the allocation of &euro;10 million as seed capital for the Fund.  It is anticipated that the Fund will supplement this seed capital by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks.</P>
        <P>With regard to banks providing credit to small businesses, the initiatives taken by the Minister for Finance in March 2011 to reorganise, recapitalise and deleverage the domestic financial system is the principal response to restore the banks to health and provide credit to business.</P>
        <P>The Government imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Each bank has informed the Department of Finance that they expect to have met their lending targets for 2011.</P>

        <P>Entities with charitable status are governed by the Charities Act 2009 under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and Equality and are answerable to their stakeholders, shareholders and funders.</P>
        <P>Many charities which formed themselves as companies have done so as companies limited by guarantee (CLG).  Due to their public membership structure they cannot avail of an audit exemption.</P>
        <P>The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) 2009 Report examined the issue of extending audit exemption to companies limited by guarantee.  It made the following recommendations:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(i) Subject in each case to consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the charities regulator, the audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to such class or classes of CLG which are charitable organisations (within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009) so as to bring them into alignment with charitable organisations that are not companies, provided that 10% of the members with voting rights should be able to require an audit.</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) The audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to all CLGs which are not charitable organisations, subject to a veto right, by any one member of the company, and further subject to the requirement that audit exemption in respect of the following year, shall be an item on the agenda of the annual general meeting.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The recommendations of the CLRG in this matter will be considered in the context of the next appropriate legislative vehicle.  The CLRG recommendations contemplate that any proposals in this matter will be subject to consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality which now has responsibility for charities regulation.</P>

        <P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register.  It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register.  The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <Col N="447" />
        <P>For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of One Parent Family Payments forms part of this broader review process.</P>

This department received a claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned.  The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of his claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The application for invalidity pension was, accordingly, disallowed by a deciding officer.  He has been notified of this decision and the reason for it.</P>

        <P>I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual projects supported by Community Employment be completed by the end of March. The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme. As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies. The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs. The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This review of financial resources is being carried out initially by local DSP staff responsible for the administration of the scheme, and is being co-ordinated centrally by the relevant Assistant Secretary of the Department.  Separately, the Community Employment Scheme is also included in a policy review of the overall range of employment support, activation and work schemes operated by the Department).  The aim of the review is to assess the schemes, individually and in combination, &ldquo;in the light of their contribution to the Department&rsquo;s policy objective of supporting people of working age into employment&rdquo; and to &ldquo;recommend any changes to the current range of schemes/programmes seen as required on the basis of the analysis carried out&rdquo;. The full terms of reference and a full list of the schemes involved are as follows.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review has been under way since mid-2011 and is scheduled for completion by the end of March.  It is being carried out by an Assistant Principal Officer of the Department under the overall direction of a Principal Officer. Prior to completion, it will be subject to oversight from the Policy Committee of the Department and of senior management. As is normal for such reviews within the Department, its conclusions and recommendations will also be the subject of consultation with stakeholders of the range of programmes involved.</P>

        <P>Currently, there are 1,143 community employment schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 places of which there are circa 22,000 participants. The overall estimated budget stands at &euro;315 million for 2012.  The training and materials grant for Community Employment is based on receipted eligible expenditure. The maximum training and materials grant for Community Employment will reduce from &euro;1,500 to <Col N="452" />&euro;500 per participant per annum from the 1st of January. At the time of the announcement of the reduction, the estimated saving identified was &euro;27.5m in a full calendar year.</P>
        <P>The current review is based on the above reduction and following completion of this review a more accurate figure will be obtained.  Some of these savings have already been achieved in 2011. There is an initial review of the financial resources of all schemes to be completed in March 2012 to identify any scheme funding shortfalls. As stated previously, I have made a commitment that no Community Employment Scheme would close pending the completion of this review. Where schemes are experiencing funding difficulties they should contact the local Community Development Officer.</P>

        <P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community/voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of Disability Allowance forms part of this broader review process.</P>
        <P>Individuals who are in receipt of a disability allowance can access the Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months. During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.  In addition, people in receipt of a disability allowance can access a range of other specific programmes, such as the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Both <Col N="455" />of these programmes aim to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the labour market.</P>

        <P>The insolvency payments scheme is a scheme to protect pay-related entitlements of employees whose employer has become legally insolvent as defined in the scheme.  Some limitation and conditions apply to payments made under the scheme.  All entitlements based on pay are limited to a maximum weekly rate which is revised periodically.  Awards made by a rights commissioner are subject to these limits.  The current limit where insolvencies occurred on or after 1 January 2005 is &euro;600 per week.  The award made to the person concerned was reduced to &euro;10,398 in accordance with this limit.</P>

        <Quest> the reason an 85 year old person (details supplied) in County Limerick, who lives alone in a house which has no heating or running water and who has had a pacemaker fitted in the last few weeks was advised that they would have to wait 30 weeks for a decision on carer&rsquo;s allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>I confirm than an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been received from the person concerned. On completion of the necessary investigations relating to all aspects of her claim a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The average time taken to award a claim for carer&rsquo;s allowance for quarter ended Sept 2011 was 17 weeks, and not the 30 weeks quoted in the question.  The average time to award for the last quarter of 2011 is unavailable as, due to the phased introduction of a new claims processing <Col N="456" />system in the carer&rsquo;s allowance area, new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.</P>
        <P>As mentioned above, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation.  The first tranche of new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer&rsquo;s allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.</P>
        <P>While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted that the intake of new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications continues to increase and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, if a person&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet his or her needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, he or she can apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</P>

        <P>Due to the current economic circumstances and the need for the Department of Social Protection to find savings of &euro;475 million in Budget 2012, it was necessary to examine all aspects of Departmental expenditure.  This has resulted in the following changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, which were announced as part of Budget 2012:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. A reduction in the training and materials grants from &euro;1,500 to &euro;500 per participant per annum;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. The ending of the concurrent entitlement to a CE payment and a social welfare assistance payment for new CE entrants;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The ending of the dual payment of Qualified Child Dependent Increases to CE participants in receipt of certain DSP payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In relation to the reduction in the training and materials grant the Department will seek to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.</P>
        <P>I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.</P>
        <P>I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.</P>

        <P>There are currently 24,101 persons in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance in (DCA) in respect of 25,914 children.  A breakdown of the persons in receipt of the allowance on a county basis is not available. </P>
        <P>DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either:</P>

          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          A scheduled review based on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed; or</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          On the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child&rsquo;s disability and how their condition may improve over time.</P>
        <P>The review interval will vary from 12 months in cases where the child&rsquo;s disability is likely to improve significantly in the short-term, to a 5 or 10 years review date if the child&rsquo;s condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a &ldquo;do not review again&rdquo; status may be used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total number of scheduled reviews undertaken in 2010 and 2011, based on recommendations from medical advisors are set out in the following table.  As the shortest review interval is 12 months, the first review was not carried out until mid-2010, given that responsibility for the Allowance transferred to the Department in April 2009.</P>

        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case. </P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 and 2011 when the intake rose to 32,432 and 31,241 respectively.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.</P>

        <P>The primary purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2007, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  It is the responsibility of the employers to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to the employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012 it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  While I acknowledge that this change may cause difficulties for employers, it must be recognised that in the current economic climate, the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable.</P>

        <P>The three statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board.  In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman (which does not have a board) comes under the remit of the Department.  The Social Welfare Tribunal consists of a Chairman and four ordinary members, two of whom are nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and two of whom are nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC).  The positions of the four ordinary members are not subject to the new procedures involving the advertising of positions due to the nature of the work of the Social Welfare Tribunal.  The Tribunal deals with cases where entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is refused where the claim is connected to a trade dispute.  Where a person feels that he/she has been unreasonably deprived of employment because his/her employer refused or failed to follow the negotiating machinery available for settling disputes, he/she may apply to the Tribunal for an adjudication on the matter.  Therefore in the interest of fairness the board is made up of individuals that are deemed to be representative of both employers and employees and are nominated by both ICTU and IBEC.  One of ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and on the nomination of ICTU a replacement member, Ms Chris Rowland, was appointed by me commencing from 24 October 2011.</P>
        <P>I have made two appointments to the Citizens Information Board since coming into office.  Mr. Eugene McErlean was appointed with effect from 7 September 2011.  This followed my public request for expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced individuals announced in July 2011.  172 applications were received and the appointment was made following a rigorous selection process in accordance with the legislation governing appointments to such a board.  On 1 November 2011, I appointed Ms Fiona Ward as a member and as she is <Col N="463" />the Department&rsquo;s representative on the board, the appointment was not subject to the new procedures.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board is a representative body and the composition of its membership is set out in the Pensions Act 1990.  The Board must comprise representatives of Trade Union Members, Employers, Occupational Pension Schemes, the Actuarial Profession, the Accounting Profession, the Legal Profession, Consumer Interests, Pensioner Interests, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Protection.  While all of its members are appointed by me, the Pensions Act 1990 provides that of the 16 members, eight are nominated by representative bodies.  These eight members represent the first six of the interests set out above.  This comprises two representatives each of the trade union and employer groups and one representative each of the occupational pension schemes, the actuarial, accounting and legal professions.  I have not made any appointments to The Pensions Board.  A new Board was appointed on 21 December 2010 for a period of five years.  No appointments have been made using the new procedures as the current Board was appointed prior to the new procedures being adopted.  There is currently one vacancy on the Pensions Board to be filled by a nominating body.  According to section 23 of The Pensions Act 1990 as amended, the Board may act notwithstanding one or more than one vacancy among its members.</P>

        <P>Due to the current economic circumstances and the need for the Department of Social Protection to find savings of &euro;475 million in Budget 2012, it was necessary to examine all aspects of Departmental expenditure.  This has resulted in the following changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, which were announced as part of Budget 2012: a reduction in the training and materials grants from &euro;1,500 to &euro;500 per participant per annum; the ending of the concurrent entitlement to a CE payment and a social welfare assistance payment for new CE entrants; and the ending of the dual payment of Qualified Child Dependent Increases to CE participants in receipt of certain DSP payments.  In relation to the reduction in the training and materials grant the Department will seek to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.</P>
        <P>I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.  I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.</P>

These officers were employed on a part time basis as Appeals Officers, and their contracts terminated at the end of December 2011.  There were no retired public servants hired by the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board or the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.  The Pensions Board has recently recruited two ex-Garda personnel on three-year contracts.  This will enhance the investigative skills available within the Pensions Board.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Government announced in Budget 2012 a reduction in the materials and training allocation for Job Initiative schemes. For 2012 the grant per place will be &euro;434.90.  This will result in a funding reduction for materials/overheads from 8% to 4.35%.  The minimum weekly payment to a Job Initiative participant will continue at &euro;416.  In money terms the materials, overheads and training element of the grant will be reduced to &euro;18.90 per place per week.  Grant aid to the sponsors to cover supervision of the project will continue on the same scale as community employment supervisors.  I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no community employment scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of a review at the end of March.</P>

        <P>Funding for the free travel scheme was frozen by the previous Government at 2010 levels of expenditure as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 and the 2011 Budget.  This cap was confirmed in the 2012 Budget.  However, there were no changes to the eligibility of old age pensioners, or people in receipt of disability allowance or carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The current free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 90 private transport operators.  In 2011, there were almost 730,000 people in receipt of free travel at a cost of &euro;76 <Col N="465" />million.  Every scheme operated by my Department, including free travel, was examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and will continue to be kept under review given the ongoing need for savings.  In addition to closely monitoring each scheme and its cost, the review continues to inform my decisions in relation to future spending and budgetary matters.</P>

        <P>Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from &euro;369 million to a provisional outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 at end 2011, a 61% increase.</P>
        <P>As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</P>
        <P>New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are based on the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>Analysis of the rental market for Wicklow carried out by my Department found that rental prices for the Bray area were having a distorting effect on the overall analysis for Wicklow.  Accordingly for the purpose of establishing limits for the county, the Bray area was excluded and will now be managed separately.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department are in the process of drawing up local limits for the Bray area. This will ensure that tenants for the full county may continue to source accommodation within the prevailing market rates and ensure the best value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>As existing claims come up for review or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits. Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation. It is accepted that in limited circumstances rent supplement recipients may be forced to secure alternative accommodation. Such applicants will be afforded reasonable time periods to secure new accommodation. Department officials administering rent supplement will continue to ensure that the rent supplement recipients&rsquo; accommodation needs are met. There will be no <Col N="466" />incidence of homelessness due to these changes. I will be publishing the rent limits review report in the coming days.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 356 together. </P>
        <P>There has been no change in the qualifying criteria for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA).  In general, the allowance can be payable in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  In addition, the person claiming the Allowance for the child must be providing for the care of the child and must be considered habitually resident in the State.</P>
        <Col N="467" />
        <P>DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either:</P>
        <P LI="2">1)  A scheduled review based on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed; or</P>
        <P LI="2">2)  On the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</P>
        <P>Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child&rsquo;s disability and how their condition may improve over time.</P>
        <P>The review interval will vary from 12 months in cases where the child&rsquo;s disability is likely to improve significantly in the short-term, to a 5 or 10 years review date if the child&rsquo;s condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a &ldquo;do not review again&rdquo; status may be used.</P>
        <P>Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the extra care needs of their child.  This information is assessed by a medical advisor and a decision is made based on their medical opinion.</P>
        <P>The total number of scheduled reviews undertaken in 2010 and 2011, based on recommendations from medical advisors are set out in the table below.  As the shortest review period is 12 months, the first review was not carried out until mid-2010, given that responsibility for the Allowance transferred to my Department from the HSE in April 2009.</P>

        <P>The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme provides a short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. The decision to award a mortgage interest supplement is dependent on a number of factors including the reason for which the mortgage was taken out rather than the type of mortgage.</P>
        <P>A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only, to eligible people in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.<b></b>&ldquo;Mortgage interest&rdquo; is defined in Section 14 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008.  In accordance with this definition, only that portion of interest that relates to the purchase, essential repair or improvement of a person&rsquo;s sole or main residence is taken into account in assessing entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 389 together.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.</P>
        <P>The amount of pension paid has always been calculated based on the person&rsquo;s contribution to the PRSI system over a working life.  This needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  The upcoming change to the PRSI contribution bands for State pension (contributory) supports this policy objective. Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions.  This situation is neither fair, equitable nor sustainable.</P>
        <P>With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 yearly average contributions will be replaced with new rate bands of between:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i)  40 and 47 yearly average contributions</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii)  30 and 39 yearly average contribution and</P>
        <P LI="1">(iii)   20 and 29 yearly average contributions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Therefore, the rate of State pension paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions between 40 and 47. Claimants who qualify for a reduced rate of State pension (contributory) will have the option to qualify for a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need.  As part of the deliberative process for Budget 2012, my Department analysed, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes, prior to the finalisation of the Budget.  In the welfare package presented in Budget 2012, I sought to minimise the impact of the necessary adjustments in my Department&rsquo;s welfare expenditure on groups vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.  My Department has prepared an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts on families of the Budget 2012 tax and welfare package, in conjunction with the Department of Finance. This analysis is currently being finalised and will shortly be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. I will arrange for the analysis to be published on the Department&rsquo;s website in March 2012, in line with the arrangements I put in place last year.  As part of a series of planned reforms to pensions to address these issues, it is also planned to adopt a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; to State pension to replace the current averaging system.  The current date for the proposed introduction of this approach is 2020.  The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  This change reflects the potential that people now have to accumulate contributions as a result of <Col N="470" />the comprehensive nature of social insurance coverage which has been in place for 20 years, and the growth in the labour force over that period.  Accordingly, a total contributions requirement of 30 years contributions for a maximum pension will be introduced.  Under the new approach, a minimum rate of State pension (contributory) will be payable at one third (10/30ths) of the maximum rate, which will be 30/30ths. These measures support the social contract between the State and the individual whereby those who pay most in a working life benefit most in retirement.</P>

        <P>Due to the current economic circumstances and the need for the Department of Social Protection to find savings of &euro;475 million in Budget 2012, it was necessary to examine all aspects of Departmental expenditure.  This has resulted in the following changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, which were announced as part of Budget 2012:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. A reduction in the training and materials grants from &euro;1,500 to &euro;500 per participant per annum;</P>
        <Col N="473" />
        <P LI="1">2. The ending of the concurrent entitlement to a CE payment and a social welfare assistance payment for new CE entrants;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The ending of the dual payment of Qualified Child Dependant Increases to CE participants in receipt of certain DSP payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In relation to the reduction in the training and materials grant the Department will seek to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.  SOLAS will continue to provide access to its training programmes to CE participants.  The need for training on CE varies depending on the needs of participants and how long they have already been on the scheme and the training already received.  Progression to employment is the key aim of the Government and there is a need to ensure that the supports we have in place aim to substantially improve individuals&rsquo; chances of securing employment.</P>
        <P>In the event that the changes in the training and material grant announced in the budget create financial difficulties for schemes, my Department will continue to provide funding for those schemes until the completion of the financial review.  In this context, I want to confirm that the funding is available in my Department to make this commitment a reality.</P>

        <P>I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.</P>
        <P>I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.  This guarantee will be funded by my Department from its 2012 allocation.</P>
        <P>In parallel, my Department is also undertaking a policy review of all employment support programmes under its aegis.  CE is being considered as part of this review and stakeholders will be consulted as part of this review process.  I expect to have this review in the first quarter of this year.  These reports at both the individual CE scheme level and at the macro level will provide good evidence on which to base future policy.</P>

        <Quest> the EU Council of Ministers on which she sits; the number of meetings of that Council that have been held between 2007 and 2011; the number of those meetings she attended; the number that were attended by the relevant Minister of State; the number that were attended by an Irish official; and if she will provide the names of those who attended in tabular form. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>During the period in question there were a total of twenty nine meetings of the Council for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs.  It is the practice for the Employment and Social Affairs items to be taken on one day of this two day meeting, and Health and Consumer Affairs to be taken separately on the other.  In relation to the former, the subject matter covers topics which span the interests of a number of Irish government departments &mdash; Social Protection; Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation; Education and Skills and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Representation at the Council is decided on the basis of the items to be discussed, and it is often the case that Ministerial attendance from this Department is not considered necessary.</P>
        <P>During this period the Minister (that is, myself or my predecessors as Minister for Social Protection) along with Department Officials, attended seven meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council.  A further ten meetings were attended by at least one Department Official.  I did not attend the meeting in December 2011 due to the Budget.  Minister of State, Deputy Cannon (Education and Skills) led the Irish delegation where the Regulations on co-ordination of social security were on the agenda.</P>
        <P>The remaining meetings were not attended by the Minister for Social Protection, and no officials from the Department travelled to these meetings.  However, Ministers or Ministers of State from the other Departments concerned may have  attended, and officials from the Permanent Representation (including the attach&eacute; from the Department of Social Protection) would have attended these meetings.</P>

        <Quest> the number of persons who were refused jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in 2011 based on household means which was taken into account at the time (details supplied). </Quest>

        <P>While it is possible to identify cases where means are deemed to be in excess of the weekly limit or the means have not been fully disclosed, it is not possible to identify separately those cases where the means are calculated using the parental income in the household.  In 2011, 245,855 Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claims were decided which included 20,865 cases where the persons were refused payment.  Of these rejections, the number who were refused as a result of having means in excess of the prescribed limit for receipt of payment was 10,660, which included 1,985 persons under 25 years of age.  There were an additional 2,349 customers who were refused payment on the basis of failing to disclose particulars of their means which included 635 persons under 25 years of age. </P>
        <Col N="477" />
        <P>Given the relatively small numbers of people aged under 25 years of age whose claims were refused on means grounds, I do not consider that there is any understatement of unemployment among that group, based on Live Register statistics.  In any event, the official statistics on unemployment are derived from the Quarterly National Household Survey which is entirely independent of the Live Register.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 to 394, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>Coolrain Bog is a site of considerable conservation significance comprising as it does an active raised bog, a rare habitat in the EU and one that is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  Active raised bog is listed as a priority habitat on Annexe I of the EU Habitats Directive.  Priority status is given to habitats and species that are threatened through<Col N="480" />out the EU.  Ireland has a high proportion of the total EU resource of this habitat type (over 60%) and so has a special responsibility for its conservation at an international level.</P>
        <P>Coolrain Bog was selected as one of 24 SAC sites notified for designation in 2002 for the protection of raised bog habitat, following a review of 136 sites previously identified as the most important sites for this habitat in Ireland.  The review was based on extensive survey work going back to 1983.  The bog was first surveyed in 1983 as part of a national survey of raised bogs by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In a review of these surveys in 1990, the site was considered as &ldquo;very important&rdquo;, as the most southerly intact example of a true midland raised bog.  It was re-surveyed in 1994 as part of the Natural Heritage Area (NHA) Survey and was considered to be recovering well from a severe fire.  The bog was surveyed again in 1999 as part of the Raised Bog Restoration Project and the report recommended it for SAC status, due to its location and its large area of active bog habitat.</P>
        <P>The site accounts over these years provide information on the presence of typical raised bog features, such as pools, hummock/ hollow complexes, flushes, etc.  The presence of characteristic species indicate the occurrence and extent of active peat formation.  Unlike most other raised bogs, Coolrain Bog developed over Old Red Sandstone rather than limestone, a factor that will have affected the water chemistry of the site and the early development of the bog.  Using aerial photographs, the high bog areas and any visible features, such as flushes and pools, were mapped and measured.  Drains, areas of burning and forestry on the high bog, along with active peat cutting, were also recorded.  Land use and drainage in the cutover bog was recorded and the cutover assessed for regeneration potential.</P>
        <P>All of this information was used when the site was reassessed in 2002 as part of the final review to select raised bogs for NHA and SAC designation.  In the 2002 review, the specific criteria used to select raised bogs of conservation importance were as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Location/peat archive</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Past ratings as to the ecological importance of the site</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Active peat formation: hummock/ hollows, sphagnum species</P>
        <P LI="1">4. High bog area (&gt;60ha)</P>
        <P LI="1">5. Integrity: percentage of original high bog remaining</P>
        <P LI="1">6. Habitat diversity: pools, flushes, soaks, bog woodland and semi-natural margins</P>
        <P LI="1">7. Geomorphology (geohydrology): basin, ridge, floodplain</P>
        <P LI="1">8. Geology</P>
        <P LI="1">9. Climatic variation</P>
        <P LI="1">10. Proximity to SACs, Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and NHAs, especially other raised bog sites</P>
        <P FLI="0">Coolrain was found to merit selection as an NHA under criteria 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9.  Because of its importance for the range of the Midland Raised Bog type, it was also assessed as suitable to be an SAC, where it received an overall assessment of B (&ldquo;good value&rdquo;), which is considered more than adequate for SAC designation.</P>
        <Col N="481" />
        <P>Between 2004 and 2008, restoration work was carried out by Coillte on 56 ha of the SAC as part of an EU LIFE-funded project.  This work has included the removal of invasive species from the high bog and felling of trees and blocking of drains on the cutover bog.  While the effectiveness of the work was somewhat limited by ongoing turf cutting and drainage of adjacent areas, it should in time improve the conservation status of the site.</P>
        <P>When Coolrain and Knockacoller Bogs were being assessed, five other bogs &mdash; Moanavan/Yellow Bog, Clonsoghy, Killnamuck (Abbyleix), Monaincha/Ballaghmore and Clonreher Bog &mdash; in County Laois were also considered for designation as either NHAs or SACs.  Coolrain and Knockcoller Bogs were chosen for SAC designation due to the superior quality of their habitat.  Monaincha/Ballaghmore and Clonreher Bogs were considered to be of sufficient conservation value to merit designation as NHAs.  The three other bogs were not considered to be to be of sufficient value to merit designation.  Two other potential NHAs (Rossagad, Knockaroe) were not considered as they had been already assessed as inadequate in earlier surveys.  In recent years, Killnamuck (Abbyleix) Bog, a Bord na M&oacute;na site which had been drained but not cut, was extensively restored and may be considered for designation in the future.  A copy of the letter which issued to landowners and those with an interest in the site, in December 2002, notifying them of the intention to designate Coolrain Bog as an SAC will be sent directly to the Deputy.  In addition, notice of intention to designate the site was advertised in the Leinster Express on 21st December 2002 and displayed in various public access points in the area.  The list of those notified is deemed to be a personal record and consequently is not publicly available.</P>
        <P>The Coolrain site has been formally adopted by the European Commission, giving it the full protection of the Habitats Directive.  The site will be formally designated, along with all of Ireland&rsquo;s SAC sites, over the coming year, though this will not affect the legal protection it is already afforded.  Landowners and turbary right owners will be notified of its formal designation at that time.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.</P>
        <P>The information sought by the Deputy concerning appointments to State boards in the bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group is set out in the following table.  In relation to the re-hiring of retired public servants, in common with other Government Departments, my Department does, from time to time, engage the assistance of retired staff on a consultancy basis where particular expertise or experience in Civil and Public Service procedures is required in relation to a particular matter.  In this regard, my Department has engaged two former senior officials to carry out specific pieces of work.  With regard to the bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have retained the services of one former official, Foras na Gaeilge have re-hired three staff members to carry out specific specialised work and the Ulster-Scots Agency have re-hired two public servants.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
        <P>In the context of the national economic difficulties, the funding available to my Department for Gaeltacht schemes has decreased in recent years.  As a result, the grant provided to households in the Gaeltacht under Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge was reduced in 2010, and again in 2011. CONCOS, the umbrella organisation representing the Irish colleges, requested my Department to endeavour not to decrease the household grant again in 2012.  I am happy to confirm that, despite further reductions in the Gaeltacht budget, my Department will be able to maintain payments this year at the 2011 level. </P>
        <P>In an effort to further develop the effectiveness of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge and to ensure its future viability, my Department will only make payments under the scheme in <Col N="484" />2012 in respect of a maximum of 14 students in each recognised household.  This is based on the premise that communication between the students and the host families functions more satisfactorily when smaller numbers of students are involved.  This amendment to the scheme should also encourage a greater number of households to become involved in providing accommodation to students attending Irish colleges in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 to 401, inclusive, and 407 to 410, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In 2011, I announced a compensation package for turf cutters affected by the cessation of turf cutting in certain designated raised bogs. The package consists of a payment of &euro;1,000 per <Col N="485" />year, index linked, for 15 years, or their relocation to non-designated bogs to continue to cut turf.  Qualifying applicants to the relocation scheme can avail of interim payments or the delivery of turf to their homes while suitable relocation sites are identified and prepared for cutting.</P>
        <P>In April 2011 my Department wrote to known owners of land and rights in those SACs that were nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999 to inform them of the cessation of turf-cutting in these sites and to invite applications for compensation.  It is estimated that there are 750 individual active turf plots on these SACs.  To date, almost 650 applications for compensation or relocation have been received relating to these sites.  Similarly, my Department has written to known owners of land and rights in the remaining 24 SACs nominated for designation in 2002.  Applications relating to these sites should be returned by the end of February 2012.  It is estimated that there are approximately 790 actively cut plots on these sites.</P>
        <P>So far, some 51 applicants have been provided with an initial payment of compensation under the terms of the schemes.  Assessment and verification of applications is a complex process, particularly in respect of proof of ownership.  My officials are working closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (as successors of the Land Commission), Bord na M&oacute;na and other organisations to assist people to provide the necessary proof of legal interest with their applications.  Clearly, there is a requirement to ensure that public moneys are correctly directed to those who are entitled to it but my Department is working to see how the checking process can be speeded up and simplified, so that people are paid as early as possible.</P>
        <P>In respect of relocation, my Department is in discussion with several groups of turf-cutters from different bogs with a view to reaching satisfactory resolutions at a local level.  Agreement has been concluded with groups from Clara Bog in County Offaly and from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh SACs in County Galway.  These solutions involved turf-cutters moving to nearby Bord na M&oacute;na bogs to continue turf-cutting.  My Department is working closely with several other groups who have come forward to engage in the process and develop solutions.  These discussions are at various stages of advancement but it is clear that engagement with such groups is delivering for turf-cutters on the ground.  Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte are providing invaluable assistance with this process.</P>
        <P>To further assist in finding suitable alternative bogs, my Department has recently placed adverts in local and national papers inviting owners of privately held non-designated bog to express an interest in selling or leasing land to my Department for use as relocation sites.  In Co Kildare, some 49 applications for compensation have been received so far.  Of these, 7 have had their initial payment of compensation made.  Discussions are ongoing between my officials and two groups of turf cutters in Kildare in respect of relocation and my understanding is that there is significant potential for relocation solutions to be found for these groups.  In Co Roscommon, 97 applications for compensation have been received relating to Bellanagare Bog and 9 applicants have received payment to date.</P>

        <P>In that context, officials from my Department work closely with their colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies within its ambit, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in relation to cultural, genealogical and heritage tourism matters.  I would see the proposed Gathering as an excellent opportunity to enhance genealogical tourism.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 to 413, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for the legislative framework, general policy development and promotional awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s unique national heritage.  My Department provides some limited funding for the built heritage.  However, the management and delivery of conservation projects is generally carried out through bodies such as the OPW, the Heritage Council and local authorities.  This does not include private investment in conservation projects.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to the number of total number of heritage sites, buildings and excavations suitable for conservation and restoration projects is not available to my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scope to provide for the protection, conservation and development of the State&rsquo;s built and natural heritage is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow, in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally.</P>

        <P>My Department does not operate a formal application scheme to cater for groups involved in the performance of the arts.  As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for funding for the arts rests with the Arts Council.  The Council is independent in its decision-making process.  Details of the Council&rsquo;s successful applicants are available on the Council&rsquo;s website at <i>www.artscouncil.ie</i>, as well as the decision-making panel and statistics on applications.  The Council&rsquo;s 2012 allocation of &euro;63.241 million will allow it to maximise its continuing support for its clients in the arts. </P>

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit and I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.</P>
        <P>The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, that investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector and their potential for assisting with cultural tourism initiatives.</P>

        <P>Standard Exploration Licence 2/11 was granted last year to a consortium comprising Providence Resources plc and Star Energy Oil and Gas Ltd over an area of approximately 380 square kilometres in the Kish bank Basin off the coast of Dalkey, County Dublin.  The exploration licence is for a six year period with an obligation to drill an exploration well during the first three years.</P>
        <P>Drilling operators are required to comply with best international practice when carrying out drilling operations offshore Ireland.  My Department will only give an approval to drill once it is satisfied that all requirements of its Rules and Procedures for drilling operations, in particular those concerning health, safety and the environment, have been fully met.</P>
        <P>Exploration Licence holders are required to engage a competent Independent Well Examiner to verify the safety of all drilling rigs, drilling equipment, pressure containment systems and drilling processes in advance of and during drilling operations.  The well examiner has a role for as long as drilling operations continue and is required to verify any changes to drilling plans.  Ongoing monitoring by the Independent Well Examiner, my Department&rsquo;s Advisers and my Department&rsquo;s technical specialists continues throughout the drilling of a well.</P>
        <P>The key to avoiding incidents that could have a negative impact on safety or the environment is to have an industry that operates to best international practice together with a robust regulatory approach.  As a consequence of the events in the Gulf of Mexico, my Department introduced additional special drilling oversight measures which including more frequent inspections and verification that all equipment, systems and procedures are in place to allow operations to proceed safely and without polluting the environment.  These additional measures are designed to support the rigorous implementation of the existing robust regulatory approach that is applied to each well drilled in the Irish offshore.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that there are 18 State bodies under the aegis of my Department.  Of these there are 15 whose boards are appointed in whole in or in part by the Minister and/or the Government.</P>
        <P>On 3 June 2011, I publicly sought Expressions of Interest from anyone wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies which were to arise on State Boards, under the aegis of my Department, up to the end of 2011.  I would point out that such appointments are made in the exercise of the statutory discretion of the Minister, and that I am neither obliged nor confined to making appointments from the tendered expressions of interest.</P>
        <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the Broadcasting Act 2009 (No. 18 of 2009) and the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 (No. 10 of 2010), provide that a number of Board members may be made on the nomination of the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee.  I have made no appointments to these Boards.</P>
        <P>The accompanying table details the appointments to State Boards which have been filled since 9th March 2011 and appointments made from the Expressions of Interest:</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>The 18 month threshold as referred to is a &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; to try to distinguish between persons who are seeking a short term income support and those who have a long term housing need.   While in general a household must be in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more in order to qualify for RAS, housing authorities do, on occasion, accept households on to RAS where they have been less than 18 months on rent supplement. This occurs where there are exceptional circumstances and where a long term housing need can be demonstrated. Bringing persons into RAS before the 18 month period has elapsed has been applied in respect of homeless persons and for households with special needs. It has also been applied administratively where a landlord is bringing a number of properties across with tenants on rent supplement for different periods and it has also been used to facilitate persons moving back to employment.  </P>
        <P>It is considered, particularly in the current economic climate where rising unemployment is resulting in an increase in the numbers on rent supplement, that the 18 month threshold remains an appropriate juncture at which to review a household&rsquo;s ongoing need for support. As the economy recovers, it is hoped that many of these households will return to employment. In that context, the type of support provided through rent supplement i.e. short term income support, is more appropriate to the needs to these households.</P>

        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 549 on 11 January 2012.</P>
        <P>The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  Once a demand has been identified, NAMA will make contact with the relevant property owner/receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the majority of suitable properties will be secured through leasing arrangements with the property owners/receivers.  Such arrangements will be determined on a case by case basis, and will involve either a local authority or an approved housing body as the prospective social housing provider depending on the particular circumstances in each case.</P>
        <P>The Housing Agency is working with housing authorities and NAMA to determine whether there is a social housing demand for the properties identified.  Where a demand is identified, this information will be provided to NAMA and arrangements will be made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.</P>

        <P>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the Government intends initiating a universal water metering programme in advance of the introduction of domestic water charges which are required under the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/IMF/ECB. My Department has prepared detailed cost estimates for the metering programme and it is intended that procurement for the programme will commence later this year. For reasons of commercial sensitivity, and so as not to adversely impact on the tendering process, my Department will not be releasing the cost estimates before contracts are put in place. The Government plans to fund the metering programme from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory remit. </P>
        <P>On 16 January 2012, I commenced a public consultation on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for reform of water services delivery in Ireland, including metering and water charges, seeking views from the public on the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges. The details of the consultation process can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>). Submissions on the Government&rsquo;s proposals can be made to my Department until 24 February 2012.</P>

        <P>Any housing specific interventions must be targeted in nature and designed to achieve specific outcomes. The main focus in terms of supports provided by Government must be on meeting the most acute needs &mdash; the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from own resources.</P>
        <P>The financial parameters in which we are operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction or acquisition programmes by local authorities.  Nevertheless, we are committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms including through increased provision of social housing.</P>
        <P>Delivery of social housing will be primarily facilitated through more flexible funding models. The social housing leasing initiative and, in particular, the Rental Accommodation Scheme, will each play their parts as long term social housing supports.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</P>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge. </P>

Any decisions taken will be made in the context of the overall budgetary situation in due course.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the 2012 estimates process, difficult decisions have had to be taken in relation to prioritising funding for core services in all programme areas.  The funding estimate to support my Department&rsquo;s mainstreamed drugs projects under the Housing programme in 2012 is &euro;100,000 compared with &euro;400,000 in 2011, i.e. a reduction of 75%.  One of 5 drugs projects mainstreamed to my Department&rsquo;s Housing programme was the Clondalkin Community Safety Forum and, in 2011, funding was provided through South Dublin County Council for two workers with the Forum. Given the estimates reduction in 2012, it is not possible for my Department to continue funding the project. </P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaging with South Dublin County Council to explore alternative funding mechanisms for the three mainstreamed drugs projects in its functional area. A consultation process has been proposed involving Clondalkin Community Safety Forum with the County Council and relevant local bodies, including Clondalkin Local Drugs Task Force, the Joint Policing Committee and the Local Policing Forum, with a view to identifying alternative funding mechanisms for this project for 2012 and beyond.  While this process is underway, my Department has agreed to provide pro rata funding of &euro;52,500 to support the three projects in South Dublin County Council for the first quarter of 2012.  This represents the final housing budget contribution to the projects.  It will be a matter for all the public funding bodies, as part of the consultation process, to identify resources to deliver on the overall objectives of the reconfigured projects beyond end March 2012.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health, which has overall responsibility for policy and funding in relation to the National Drugs Strategy, has advised that the total provision for the 24 local and regional drugs taskforces in 2012 is &euro;29.581 million.  Specifically, Clondalkin and Tallaght Local Drugs Task Forces have been allocated some &euro;1.422 million and &euro;1.250 million respectively to fund their activities in 2012. In addition, in the context of a public funding provision of &euro;260 million for drugs programmes across all Departments and agencies in 2011, my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy is currently undertaking a review of the structures that underpin the National Drugs Strategy at local, regional and national level, including how the current funding structures can be improved or streamlined, particularly in relation to local and regional drugs task forces. My Department has no information in relation to employment and funding of community safety forum workers under the aegis of any other Government Department or agency.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and fora to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  Accordingly, the Department of Justice and Equality has commenced a review of how the Joint Policing Committees have operated since their establishment, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and local authorities, to be followed by a broader consultation process, with the aim of seeing how their operation might be improved.  The Department of Justice and Equality is in contact with local authorities in this regard, and work on the review is ongoing.</P>

        <P>The provisions of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 came into force from 1 January 2012. </P>
        <P>Under this legislation, dog breeding establishments already in operation have a lead-in time of six months (i.e. until 30 June 2012) to apply to their local authority to be included in the register of dog breeding establishments. As with other dog control issues, local authorities are responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the legislation locally.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that with the enactment of this legislation, as well as the Welfare of Greyhounds Act, 2011, we will now have a much enhanced level of protection for all dogs in the State.</P>
        <P>The Dog Control Statistics for 2011 are currently being compiled.  They are usually published during the first quarter of the following year and it is intended to publish the 2011 report in a similar timescale.</P>

        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge. The definition of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; in section 2(1) is relevant when considering whether a residential property that is not used or lived in is liable to the household charge. </P>
        <P>There are a number of indicators as to what makes a house suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining any liability to the household charge. The indicators include the structure of the house, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the Act.The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the household charge on the liability date (1 January 2012) and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charge in respect of that property by the due date.</P>

        <P>In 2010 eleven retired civil servants in receipt of civil service pensions were re-engaged by my Department on a fee basis at a total cost of &euro;55,415. The abatement principle, which ensures that the fee paid plus pension does not exceed the rate of pay the pensioner would receive if he/she had continued service in their former post, applied to all such payments made. The tasks carried out include time bound tasks or projects such as membership of expert groups, occasional service on interview boards, value for money reviews and process audits.  </P>
        <P>Information relating to 2011 will be available following the finalisation of the Appropriation Accounts which are currently being compiled.</P>

        <P>The Act defines &ldquo;owner&rdquo; at section 1.

        <P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, launched by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</P>

        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorization process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</P>

          <Miles com="bull66" />

        <P FLI="0">In some cases a local authority may have found that conditions in respect of a certain phase of a development were relatively good and that, for example, no serious public safety issues could be identified. This phase of the development may have been categorized under category 1 or 2. Conversely, safety issues may have been identified in another phase of the same overall development, or development in that second phase may have been abandoned altogether, implying a category 3 or 4 identification for that phase.</P>
        <P>This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 452 together.</P>
        <P>Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 provides that owners of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems must ensure that their systems do not cause a risk to human health or the environment. The Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 augments the requirements of the 2007 Act and will introduce a new registration and inspection system for septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.</P>
        <P>As I stated in the reply to Question Nos. 171, 174 to 177, inclusive, and 180 of 19 January, it is not intended  to apply new standards, for example as set out in the EPA&rsquo;s 2009 Code of Practice, to older on-site systems as part of the new inspection system.  Where an inspection reveals a problem, issues such as existing site size, hydrological and geological conditions etc. will be considered to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective remediation works necessary.</P>
        <P>It is my intention, following the enactment of the legislation, to carry out a public consultation on draft performance standards for domestic wastewater treatment systems which will be prepared by my Department in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency. These standards will also include the minimum requirements for the maintenance and de-sludging of treatment systems.</P>
        <P>With regard to any remediation works required, I have previously signalled my intention to introduce planning exemptions for works arising from the Bill. Any necessary exemptions will be put in place in advance of the commencement of inspections.</P>

        <P>Axes 3 &amp; 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP), for which my Department has responsibility, continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities. The main objectives of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy. The RDP is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources. The programme is inclusive in its approach to arriving at solutions to such challenges using a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; method where local communities provide local solutions.</P>
        <P>In general, the rates of grant aid available under the measures of the RDP are 50% for private promoters and 75% for Community promoters with some higher rates available for specific activities such as Training (100%) and Analysis and Development (90%). In recent times, due mainly to the current economic climate, it has been difficult for private individuals and community groups alike to obtain the matched funding required to avail of this support level, particularly for larger projects. As part of a suite of measures to address these and other issues relating to the delivery of the RDP my Department is proposing to change the rates of aid available to both private promoters and community groups and will be requesting a rate change of 75% for private promoters and 90% for community promoters. Such changes have to be approved by the European Commission. The outcome of this approval process will be communicated to all Local Development Companies as soon as it&rsquo;s available which is anticipated to be early in the second quarter of this year.</P>

        <P>Local authorities are permitted, under statute, to charge fees in relation to the services they provide.  In the case of the Dublin City Council Fire Brigade Service, it is understood that the call out charge in place reflects only a proportion of the overall cost of attendance at incidents.  The other costs of the Service, including fire prevention, inspections and emergency management are being met through a range of income sources, including commercial rates, Government grants and subsidies, the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences.  </P>

        <P>The greater the degree of separation of different categories of waste by consumers and businesses, the easier it will be to reduce the proportion of our waste disposed of in landfill and to create the conditions for investment in much needed recovery and recycling infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Waste presentation is largely determined by permit conditions and local bye-laws. The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 provide that a permitted waste collector must source-segregate, treat or recover a specified proportion of waste collected, or class or classes of such waste, in such manner as may be specified by the relevant local authority. In 2008, my Department instructed local authorities to provide, as a matter of urgency, for the implementation of source-segregated collection for organic waste in urban areas.</P>
        <P>In support of this, the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009 require the segregation and recovery of food waste arising in the commercial sector. A Regulatory Impact Assessment is currently underway in relation to the placing of an obligation on waste collectors to provide or arrange for the separate collection of household food waste and its diversion from disposal to recovery and recycling.</P>
        <P>Recent, and planned, increases to the landfill levy are also of importance, as they provide an economic mechanism to encourage the segregation of waste.</P>
        <P>The National Waste Report 2009 states that a 2-bin service was provided to 72% of serviced households and a 3-bin service was provided to a further 24% of serviced households.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the strong legal and policy framework, our improved performance and the likely impact of recent and anticipated changes, further progress is required. Waste collectors have an important role in that regard and I expect local authorities to enforce any breach of the terms of waste collection permits or local bye-law regimes vigorously. The Programme for Government   commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery. I am prioritising this commitment. Relevant potential policy initiatives, such as the mandatory segregation of waste, will be addressed. Also of relevance is the work underway in relation to household waste collection market structures. I expect to be in a position to submit final pro<Col N="510" />posals in relation to national waste policy and household waste collection markets to Government early this year.</P>

        <P>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are placed under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, it is a matter for individual local authorities to take measures in respect of properties that may have a liability to the NPPR charge under the provisions of the 2009 Act.</P>

        <P>Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Information in respect of funding provided under Section 10 for the 34 City and County Council areas for the years 2008 to 2011 is set out in the Table below. Funding is provided at the rate of 90% of cost with the housing authorities providing a further 10% from their own resources. My Department&rsquo;s funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is &euro;50 million, which together with 10% provided from housing authorities&rsquo; own resources, brings the total available funding to &euro;55 million in 2012. </P>
        <P>The level of funding required for each housing authority area will vary from year to year, having regard <i>inter alia </i>  to the gradual introduction of a &lsquo;housing led&rsquo; approach and the ongoing reconfiguration of homeless services.  The development in 2012 of more devolved regional service protocols and allocations for the provision of accommodation-related funding &mdash; commencing with the Dublin region &mdash; means that the projected outturn for each of the housing authority areas in 2012 is unknown. Devolution of Section 10 funding, as foreseen under the National Implementation Plan for the Homeless Strategy, will provide for an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, and will improve overall efficiency, value for money and local decision making in homeless services.</P>

        <P>There are two current schemes for tenants of housing authorities to purchase their homes.   The first, the tenant purchase scheme, is provided for in section 90 of <Col N="512" />the Housing Act, 1966.   The second, the incremental purchase scheme in respect of newly-built homes designated by housing authorities for incremental purchase, is provided for under Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009. The details of the schemes are set out in the legislation and in the associated regulations.</P>
        <P>The criteria for a tenant purchasing a home under the tenant purchase scheme include that a tenant must have a period of reckonable tenancy of at least one year&rsquo;s duration.  In the case of the 2011 Fixed Term Tenant Purchase Scheme for long-standing tenants, for which applications are now closed, a ten year tenancy period applied.   The Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1997 provides that a housing authority may refuse to sell a dwelling to a tenant where the authority considers that the tenant is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour or that a sale to that tenant would not be in the interest of good estate management.  Certain classes of houses, as distinct from tenants, may be excluded from sale under the Regulations and in accordance with the provisions of individual tenant purchase schemes adopted by housing authorities.</P>
        <P>Incremental purchase is available in respect of designated houses to eligible existing and prospective tenants. Under the incremental purchase scheme, there is no minimum tenancy period required. However the following criteria are considered&mdash;</P>

        <P>Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and associated credit policy. To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only. Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied. In assessing loan applications local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income. While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection. </P>
        <P>In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed. The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority. All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.</P>
        <P>The relevance of the difference between projected mortgage repayments and current rental payments for a prospective purchaser is limited. It takes no account, for example, of the fact <Col N="513" />that while rent levels can be adjusted to reflect changing household income, mortgage repayments cannot. Nor does it take account of the additional costs taken on when a household becomes a homeowner thereby assuming responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of their home. These provisions apply for purposes of mortgage lending by all local authorities.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 and 470 together. </P>
        <P>There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system, <i>www.householdcharge.ie</i>, is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card or in four instalments by direct debit.   In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card or in four instalments by direct debit by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments are available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way must register their details by 1 March, 2012.</P>
        <P>A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county/city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge up to 31 March, 2012.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive suite of payment options available to persons with a liability to pay the household charge.</P>

        <P>Planning authorities are independent statutory bodies, with democratically elected councils and their own management structures to carry out their statutory <Col N="515" />duties. The Planning and Development Act 2000 extended the rules relating to ethics for planning authority staff. Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 introduced a comprehensive ethics regime for councillors and local government employees which came into effect on 1 January 2003. This regime includes annual declaration of interests, disclosure of interests as a matter arises and a public register of interests. This regime was further enhanced by the national Codes of Conduct for Councillors and Employees. </P>
        <P>In proceedings under the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010, where there is proof that certain persons in public office have received monies or other benefit from a person who has an interest in the outcome of their decisions, including planning decisions, there is a presumption that such payments were given and received corruptly.</P>

        <P>The question appears to refer to the introduction of the CO2-based system of motor tax introduced in 2008 which provides that rates for private vehicles registered on or after 01 July 2008 (including hybrid vehicles)<b></b>are based on the CO2 emissions rating supplied by the Revenue Commissioners.  The scheme also applies to some vehicles registered between 01 January and 30 June 2008.</P>
        <P>The question of applying the new CO2 based motor tax system to all cars was subject to detailed discussion during the debate on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2008.  Any retrospection would not be possible, as the CO2 data for the pre-2008 car fleet have not been authenticated for business purposes.  The cost of any retrospection could be substantial were it possible, depending on how it applied, and could have direct implications for the revenue base of local government.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, the motor taxation system is kept under regular review in my Department.</P>

        <P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, launched by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows: category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; category two, where a receiver has been appointed; category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents </P>
        <P>This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge. Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver.</P>

        <P>Under the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 owners of residential property are liable to pay the household charge. There are a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge. In particular, section 4 of the Act provides for an exemption where an owner of a residential property, which was that person&rsquo;s main or sole residence, is not residing in that property on a liability date by reason of his or her having had to vacate the property due to long term mental or physical infirmity and that person is residing in another property that he/she does not own. </P>
        <P>Subsection 6 of section 4 of the Act defines the meaning of &ldquo;long term mental or physical infirmity&rdquo; as requiring the person to vacate the property in which he/she had been dwelling for a continuous period of more than 12 months and provides that such an infirmity must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.</P>

        <P>Section 14 of the Act provides for data sharing and exchange for the purposes of the household charge.  My Department has met recently with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the operation of the data sharing provisions in the legislation.  It has been agreed that protocols will be developed for the exchange of data in consultation with that Office and with relevant agencies/bodies in advance of utilisation of the above mentioned legislative provisions.</P>

        <P>There are already two types of house purchase loan available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &ldquo;credit crunch&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>To date 10 Home Choice Loans have been issued, with a total value of &euro;2,007,080. A further 6 Home Choice Loans have been approved but not yet drawn down, with a total value of &euro;1,192,840. The low rate of uptake suggests that access to credit is just one of a number of reasons for the low level of transactions in the housing market at present and that wider economic sentiment has a more significant impact on sentiment in the housing market.</P>
        <P>It is not the intention of this scheme &mdash; or of any other Government intervention in the housing sector &mdash; to incentivise or entice people into the market. It is not intended therefore that the Home Choice loan would be modified to offer any such inducement or offer. It is designed only to facilitate credit worthy households who have been affected by conditions in the mortgage market.</P>
        <P>As such, the scheme is a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns. Recent data published by the Central Bank would indicate that that point has not yet been reached.</P>

        <P>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. The costs arising, including those in relation to advertising, are a matter for the LGMA and the county and city councils.</P>
        <P>Significant efforts will be made to ensure that property owners are aware of the household charge and the liability and payment dates. The LGMA and local authorities have commenced <Col N="518" />a national information campaign to advise people of the household charge and their responsibilities in relation to payment of the charge.  A similar and successful advertising and information campaign was undertaken in the context of the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences on its introduction in 2009 with further advertising taking place each year since. It is also intended that a household charge information leaflet will be issued shortly to residential properties in the State.  I am confident that those liable to the household charge will be aware of their obligation to discharge their liability for the charge by 31 March 2012 and thereby avoid any late payment fees or late payment interest.</P>

        <P>Fire services are provided by the local authorities in accordance the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003. The fire services have been pro-active in using the &ldquo;shared services&rdquo; concept, and groups of authorities and specific services (such as the regional mobilization and communications systems) have been provided on a shared basis over several years. Further opportunities for shared service will continue to be explored and developed where the business case supports this and in accordance with other changes in local government.  The national blueprint for further developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of fire services is set out in the Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  The Framework sets out policies and key actions in the areas of: Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and Legislative Support.</P>

        <P>Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of Garda transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. The responsibility for the efficient deployment of all official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer who may allocate vehicles between stations as required by operational circumstances. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda vehicles within each District, including Castlerea, is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis to ensure that an effective policing service is provided to the community and that the optimum use is made of available resources.</P>
        <P>I am informed that   there are currently two Garda vehicles attached to Castlerea Garda station, a marked car and an unmarked car.  In addition I have been advised that the Garda authorities are satisfied that this allocation is sufficient to meet on-going operational requirements within the District.</P>

        <P>The position is that Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements, including rights of way. Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, provided that easements shall be acquired at law by prescription only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</P>
        <P>Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the Registration of Title Act 1964 respectively which simplify the procedures for registering easements set out in the 2009 Act. The amendments permit the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such easements without a court order where there is no disagreement between the parties. Rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2011 (S.I. No. 559 of 2011) and they have been published on the PRA web site (<i>www.prai.ie</i>).</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect to ensure continuity of service with reduced budgets and resources.  Greater flexibility in the deployment of available resources is critical in maintaining the delivery of front line court services.</P>
        <P>In order to be of assistance, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a comprehensive internal review was conducted in 2009/2010 which included the administrative structure of provincial court offices and recommended the amalgamation of Circuit and District Court offices into combined court offices to provide a multi-jurisdictional administration unit in each county.  The recommendations of the review are currently the subject of a transformation programme within the Courts Service incorporating the amalgamation of Circuit Court and District Court offices in each county into a Combined Court Office for the county. The Combined Court Office for County Louth which is currently scheduled for implementation in October will be located in Dundalk.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the Courts Service is currently reviewing the future necessity for, and sustainability of, a stand-alone District Court office in Drogheda.  I am informed that this review is being undertaken in an open manner and that a consultative meeting was held on 8 December 2011 attended by a wide range of organisations and local groups including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Prison Service, Probation Service, Mayor of Drogheda, Drogheda Women&rsquo;s Refuge and a large number of local legal practitioners.  I also understand that the Chief Executive of the Courts Service met a delegation including a number of elected representatives from the Drogheda area on 27 January 2012.  The Court Service are now proceeding to consider all the points made at the consultative meeting, at the meeting with the Chief Executive and in a <Col N="524" />comprehensive written submission received from the Drogheda Solicitors Association.  The Service inform me that a final decision will be made by the end of February.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 481 and 482 together.</P>
        <P>Since I became Minister I have taken a number of measures to ensure that the time it takes for the processing of vetting applications improves significantly and I remain very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible.</P>
        <P>The average processing time at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) now is 2 weeks approximately.  This is a substantial improvement on this time last year when processing took 11 weeks. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are approximately 8,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed at present.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, seasonal fluctuations will still impact on the processing time. Furthermore, the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications may result in the processing time exceeding the present average of 2 weeks. Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.</P>
        <P>Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Decisions on the suitability for the recruitment/engagement of the person concerned rest at all times with the recruiting organisation.</P>
        <P>The Garda Vetting certificate is non-transferable. It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued. Furthermore, non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system.</P>

The Group&rsquo;s report was published in December, 2011.  Many of the recommendations in this Report fall within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health.   Insofar as there are issues in the Report relevant to my Department, I am arranging for the Report and its recommendations to be examined by officials in my Department.  I will consider what further actions, if any, are necessary once this examination has been completed.</P>

        <P>Each visa application is considered on its individual merits, the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why the visa should be granted. It should be noted, however, that where there is a possibility that the applicant may become a burden on state resources, that will be taking into consideration when arriving at a decision. All information that the applicant wishes to be taken into consideration should be included when a visa application is submitted.</P>
        <P>Information on making a visa application can be found on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Services website (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>). It should be borne in mind however that the information contained on the website is intended to act as a guideline only.  It does not limit the discretion of the Visa Officer in dealing with individual applications.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is within the Navan Garda District.  Local Garda management is not aware of any significant difficulties being experienced in the area as a result of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Any such incidents reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are fully investigated.</P>
        <P>A member of the local Community Policing Unit is allocated specifically to the area concerned and liaises closely with local residents and the business communities.  The area is the subject of regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit, supplemented as required by the District and Divisional Detective and Drug Units and the Regional Support Unit.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources.</P>
        <P>A Community Alert scheme was re-established in the area in November, 2011. A public meeting was held on 29 November, 2011, which was addressed by the Sergeant-in-Charge of the Community Policing Unit.  A further meeting was held on 17 January, 2012 and a committee was elected.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in Meath Garda Division and that current structures in place meet the requirements for the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service.</P>
        <P>Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences. Community policing is a central feature and core value of our policing policy and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.</P>

        <P>There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </P>
        <P>These staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training and development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services. In doing so, they release highly trained Garda&iacute; from administrative tasks to operational policing.</P>
        <Col N="532" />

        <P FLI="0">While the current number of civilian support staff is an increase on previous years, the level in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is still lower than in comparable police forces. This is reflected in the 2009 Garda Inspectorate report on Resource Allocation, which called for the number of Garda&iacute; available for operational duty to be maximised through a structured programme of civilianisation.  We will continue to maximise the number of civilian support staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na consistent with overall policy on numbers in the public service and taking into account the scope for the appropriate redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the public service as part of the reform process under the Croke Park Agreement.</P>

        <P>The person concerned sought to assert a right of residency in the State based on the principles set out in the European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case. Her case to remain in the State was considered in detail before a decision was taken that the terms of the Zambrano Judgment were not met in her particular case. This decision was notified to the person concerned by letter dated 17th January, 2012.</P>
        <P>In light of the particular and unique circumstances of this case, I have instructed Department Officials to conduct an early review so that the position in the State of the person concerned is further considered from a humanitarian perspective. I expect matters to be finalised at an early date.  I should add that this review will take place in the context of the provisions of the Immigration Acts.</P>

        <Quest> when he will legislate for the reality of surrogacy in this country, whereby the children of surrogate arrangements entered into by Irish parents have not enjoyed citizenship or the right to health treatment and education. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">

        <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>As I indicated in my response to question number 485 of 24 January 2012, the law as it stands allows children born through surrogacy arrangements to acquire Irish citizenship, provided the commissioning father is the biological father of the child. Such a father may apply to court for a declaration of paternity under section 35 of the Status of Children Act 1987. Once paternity is established the child can be determined to be an Irish citizen. </P>
        <P>Establishment of paternity also allows the father to apply for a guardianship order which requires and enables him to exercise full legal responsibility for the child including decision-making on the child&rsquo;s health and medical treatment, upbringing and education.</P>
        <P>Given the complex way in which existing law, domestic and international, applies to surrogacy matters, a guidance document for people who are considering arranging for a surrogate mother to give birth to a child outside the State has been prepared by an interdepartmental group in consultation with me and the Office of the Attorney General. I expect that the guidance document will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated that I intend in due course to develop proposals for legislation on surrogacy.</P>

        <P>The Authority has however informed me that the average processing times for applications, such as that referred to by the Deputy, is currently approximately 6 weeks.

        <P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in April, 2011.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

There are currently no proposals to change the legislation in this regard.&rdquo; I have not met with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the matter.</P>

        <P>The moratorium on Public Service Recruitment continues to apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College.  A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirements and Government targets, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the number of public servants.</P>
        <P>Recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by Statutory Regulations, namely the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admission &amp; Appointments) Regulations 1988/2005. These regulations incorporate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 which allow the Public Appointments Service to give due recognition to any satisfactory service by a person as a reserve member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <P>The bodies under the aegis of my Department are the Civil Defence Board, the Army Pensions Board and the Board of Coiste an Asgard.  The Civil Defence Act 2002 provides that the Board shall consist of at least eight but not more than fourteen members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence. Legislation is currently being drafted to dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions of the Board back into the Department of Defence. I appointed the current Board as an interim measure from 11 July 2011. In this context, none of the positions were advertised, nor was the chairperson interviewed by an Oireachtas committee.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member recently became vacant due to retirement, and I appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on and from 19 December 2011 on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position could not be advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> on 13 January 2012.</P>
        <P>In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. As a result, no funding was provided in 2010 or 2011. No appointments have been made since that decision was taken and the Board will be dissolved shortly.</P>

        <P>Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government decided to maintain the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  In response to the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, has been initiated.  This will encompass a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from the current three to two. The primary focus of the re-organisation is to maintain operational outputs and capabilities to best effect, within a reduced strength.  I have asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  This will include proposals regarding territorial areas of responsibility. You will appreciate that in advance of receipt and consideration of the options available, from the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, I will not be in a position to answer detailed questions on possible outcomes. However, I can confirm that further barrack closures are not envisaged as part of this process. </P>

        <P>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission&rsquo;s response is expected shortly.</P>
        <Col N="542" />
        <P>The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the &euro;30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable &mdash; 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</P>

        <P>The overall amount of funding for the CAP will be decided in the context of the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget from 2014 to 2020.   My overarching objective in the negotiations is to secure a strong and well-resourced CAP in order to meet food security needs and to preserve family farming in Europe.   This is a whole of Government position.</P>
        <P>The MFF proposals, published by the Commission in June 2011, maintain CAP expenditure at 2013 levels in nominal terms. From an Irish viewpoint, this represents a reasonable starting point for the CAP negotiations, particularly as there was significant pressure from some Member States to cut CAP spending. However, pressures for further cuts to the CAP budget remain, and it is important that these continue to be resisted.</P>
        <P>One of my key priorities in the CAP reform negotiations is to retain Ireland&rsquo;s funding both for direct payments and for rural development in any redistribution of CAP funds between Member States.  The proposal is to use a pragmatic basis to redistribute pillar 1 (Direct Income Supports) between Member States and I welcome this. A specific proposal on pillar 2 (Rural Development) funding has not yet emerged.  However it is proposed that the distribution between Member States shall be based on objective criteria and past performance, with the allocations to be decided by the Commission annually under the Implementing Acts procedure. <Col N="543" /> Depending on the objective criteria chosen, Ireland could lose substantially under this proposal. I believe that redistribution of funds between Member States should involve pillar 1 and pillar 2 together and should be done on the pragmatic basis envisaged for pillar 1.  The net point for Ireland is that we receive below average payments per hectare for pillar 1 and 2 combined and I would see no justification for a reduction in payments.</P>
        <P>I have already conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s views on this to the EU commission and other Member States and I will continue to press this point as negotiations continue.</P>

        <P>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission&rsquo;s response is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the &euro;30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable &mdash; 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</P>

        <P>The milk price paid to dairy suppliers is a commercial matter between the dairy farmer and his/her processor.  Market forces have a major influence on the price paid to farmers for milk, as world market prices for dairy products determine the returns received by dairy processors and these are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  It is encouraging to see that 2011 was a very successful year for the dairy industry, with exports of Irish dairy products and ingredients valued at some &euro;2.66 billion, an increase of 17% over 2010  . The CSO&rsquo;s recent advance estimate of output, input and income in agriculture for 2011 showed output value in the milk sector up &euro;304 million, or 20%, compared to 2010.  The effect of this performance can be seen in the milk price paid to Irish producers, and according to official CSO data, the average milk price paid to Irish producers in 2011 was 34 cent per litre, well above the 2010 average of 30 cent per litre  .</P>
        <P>Producer milk prices vary widely across the EU but,   as the structure of the dairy industry differs greatly between member states, it can be misleading to simply compare prices.  Nevertheless, Ireland is generally close to the average EU price and in the most recent EU data for <Col N="548" />November 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s milk price was &euro;38/100kg compared to the EU average of &euro;35.2/100kg.</P>
        <P>Dairy markets remain relatively stable at the start of 2012, and the short term outlook is quite positive.  There will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, and my Department provides &euro;6 million per annum through its Dairy Efficiency Scheme to encourage the adoption of technology and best practice at farm level to equip farmers with the knowledge and skills necessary to maximise their output, reduce their costs of production and increase margins.  It is important, however, to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good. Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.</P>

        <P>Under the Nitrates Regulations, farmers are required to maintain certain records for each calendar year and to keep these records for five years.  As part of a Cross Compliance Nitrates inspection carried out on the 21st of November 2008 the person named submitted such records to the Department.</P>
        <P>During a subsequent evaluation of these records the maximum fertilisation rate for available Phosphorus was found to have been exceeded in contravention of the Nitrates regulations and a 3% penalty was recorded.  The person named was informed of this decision on the 2nd of November 2011 and of his right to seek a review. He was also informed of his right to appeal the outcome of a review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals office.  The 3% penalty was deducted from the 2011 payment due to the person named. There is no record of a request for a review of this decision.</P>

        <P>The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 and Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota availed of the sugar restructuring scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime <Col N="549" />runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current legal limitations, I have strongly supported the abolition of the EU sugar quota regime from September 2015, as part of the CAP reform discussions which are currently underway in the EU Council of Ministers. I also raised the issue with EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Dacian Ciolos during his recent visit to Ireland. In this regard, I have also met in 2011 with two separate groups here who have conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility. At both meetings I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.</P>

        <P>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission&rsquo;s response is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the &euro;30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>Any analysis of the Scheme must take into account the impact of the various enterprises on the local economy. As is clearly evident, the main benefits arise from (i) beef rearing, (ii) dairying and (iii) sheep breeding enterprises. There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants&rsquo; contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.</P>

        <P>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1 November 2010 and full payment has issued in respect of 2010. </P>
        <P>Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, had to be completed before any payment could issue in respect of 2011. In addition, applicants with non-productive Capital Investments under their plans, as in this case, must submit a documented claim in respect of such investments before the year 2 payment can issue.</P>
        <P>During the administrative checks, a discrepancy was identified in the capital investment claim of the person named. My Department has issued a letter to the person named notifying him of the situation which involves the non-completion of an action which had received approval. The non-completion renders the action ineligible for payment. The application will now be further processed and payment in respect of the eligible options will issue as quickly as possible.</P>

This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme. It is not possible, at this stage, to break the Scheme changes down on a county by county basis.</P>
        <P>The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable &mdash; 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that eligible applicants in 2012 must have met (a) a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare in 2011 (equivalent to 2 ewes per hectare) and (b) 0.15 livestock units per hectare in 2012. However, in recognition of the environmental objectives of the Scheme, specific provisions will be made for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. If the proposals are accepted, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, will be written formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process. It is also intended that provision will be made for new entrants to farming.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to continue with the minimum stocking density of 0.15 lu/ha in respect of 2012. With a view to focusing the aid to those farmers, who make the most significant contribution to the rural economy and to the environment in general, it is proposed that the calculation of the stocking density will be based on (a) a retention period of 6 months where the stocking density on the holding has to be equal to or greater than 0.15 lu/ha and (b) the stocking density calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</P>
        <P>With the intention of targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that digressive payments will apply for farmers whose holdings consist of land situated in both Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas.</P>
        <P>Any analysis of the Scheme must take into account the impact of the various enterprises on the local economy. As is clearly evident, the main benefits arise from (i) beef rearing, (ii) dairying and (iii) sheep breeding enterprises. There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants&rsquo; contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed to exclude land situated more than 80 kilometres from a farmer&rsquo;s holding from aid under the Scheme. This exclusion will be confined to applicants, whose main holding is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area, and who declares land situated more than 80 kilo<Col N="552" />metres from the main holding. It is contended that the local impact of the farming of those lands situated in the Disadvantaged Areas is marginal.</P>
        <P>I remain committed to supporting farmers who choose to farm to environmentally friendly practices and to ensuring that these farmers are rewarded for their efforts. However, given the state of the public finances I had no option but to announce a 10% cut in the rate of payment to existing REPS applicants. This cut, which will apply to 2012 payments onwards is subject to the approval of the Commission and I am not yet in a position to indicate how the change will affect applicants on an individual basis or impact on the distribution of payments at county level.</P>

        <P>The person named commenced REPS 4 in June 2008 and received payments for the first three years of the contract period. Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, had to be completed before any payment could issue in respect of 2011. These checks have now been completed and 75% payment totalling &euro;2,852.56 has issued to the person named on 26th   January 2012. The 25% balancing payment of &euro;950.85 will issue shortly.</P>

        <P>My Department operates a number of grants and scheme payments for farmers.  Funding for these schemes is provided by the Exchequer, the EU or a combination of both and all expenditure must be carried out in an appropriate manner and in strict compliance with the regulatory requirements.</P>
        <P>Area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, in particular, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification Scheme, to be completed before payments can issue.  These rigorous procedures, including on-farm inspections, apply to payments under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS). The checks are carried out to ensure that applications comply with the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements.</P>
        <P>I am acutely conscious of the financial pressures on many farm families and of the importance of grant and scheme payments to their incomes and cash-flow. I have given the highest priority to the processing and payment of all scheme payments while meeting the regulatory requirements and responsibilities, and to the elimination of all unnecessary delays.</P>
        <P>Insofar as payments to farmers in Co Kerry are concerned, a total of 1,461 participants have been paid under REPS 4. Payments to the remaining scheme applicants are being paid as queries arising are resolved.</P>
        <Col N="553" />
        <P>The situation under the Single Payment Scheme is that the vast majority of applicants have received their payment. To date, my Department has paid &euro;59 million to 7,546 farmers. The remaining 31 farmers have errors in their applications and require further processing, including responses, before they can be cleared for payment.</P>
        <P>There is a similar situation in respect of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme where payments amounting to &euro;18.6 million have been made to 7,600 farmers. There are 268 outstanding cases but many of these will not be eligible for payment as they will not meet the stocking density minimum requirement of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. The outstanding cases are prioritised by my Department and cases are processed for payment as soon as satisfactory responses are received from applicants.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
        <P>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. My intention is that the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget will be submitted to Brussels shortly.</P>
        <P>The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the &euro;30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable &mdash; 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant <Col N="555" />contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that eligible applicants in 2012 must have met (a) a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare in 2011 (equivalent to 2 ewes per hectare) and (b) 0.15 livestock units per hectare in 2012. However, in recognition of the environmental objectives of the Scheme, specific provisions will be made for those farmers, who had a stocking density less than 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure. If the proposals are accepted, all applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 lu/ha in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process. It is also intended that provision will be made for new entrants to farming.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to continue with the minimum stocking density of 0.15 lu/ha in respect of 2012. With a view to focusing the aid to those farmers, who make the most significant contribution to the rural economy and to the environment in general, it is proposed that the calculation of the stocking density will be based on (a) a retention period of 6 months where the stocking density on the holding has to be equal to or greater than 0.15 lu/ha and (b) the stocking density calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</P>
        <P>With the intention of targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that digressive payments will apply for farmers whose holdings consist of land situated in both Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas.</P>
        <P>Any analysis of the Scheme must take into account the impact of the various enterprises on the local economy. As is clearly evident, the main benefits arise from (i) beef rearing, (ii) dairying and (iii) sheep breeding enterprises. There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants&rsquo; contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed to exclude land situated more than 80 kilometres from a farmer&rsquo;s holding from aid under the Scheme. This exclusion will be confined to applicants, whose main holding is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area, and who declares land situated more than 80 kilometres from the main holding. It is contended that the local impact of the farming of those lands situated in the Disadvantaged Areas is marginal.</P>

        <P>The Irish National Seafood Programme was published in July 2010 and sets out a framework for Exchequer grant aid for certain aspects of the seafood industry, including aquaculture and seafood processing.  The National Programme is complimentary to the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013, which sets out a framework for EU co-funded grant aid to certain other <Col N="556" />aspects of the seafood industry, primarily fleet decommissioning. Both Programmes seek to implement the National Strategic Plan for the Seafood Sector for the period 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>In the course of the public and statutory consultation process of the strategic environmental assessment of the National Programme, concerns were raised by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources concerning the negative impact on migratory wild salmonids from sea lice emanating from salmon farms.  The then Minister agreed with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that until such time as the sea lice issue has been satisfactorily resolved, no financial assistance would be given to marine salmon aquaculture licence holders during the course of this National Programme, on a precautionary basis.</P>
        <P>A policy document entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Improved Pest Control on Irish Salmon Farms&rdquo; was developed by my Department, in consultation with the Marine Institute and BIM in 2008. The Strategy included a number of recommendations to provide for enhanced sea lice control, including the establishment of a National Implementation Group to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and its recommendations. This Group was established in December 2008 and its report was published by my Department in December 2010.  That Report concluded that over the course of its work, the vast majority of salmon aquaculture sites maintained sea lice levels below treatment trigger levels and, in all instances when notices to treat were issued, effective treatment plans were put into practice.</P>
        <P>Despite the positive conclusions of the National Implementation Group, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources wished to see further progress before their concerns were allayed.  My Department is keeping in regular contact with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on this issue.</P>

        <P>Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.

        <P>An official  delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I am awaiting an assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority  is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.</P>

        <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of my Department is that four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), the Family Support Agency (FSA), the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children. </P>
        <Col N="558" />
        <P>In line with the Government Decision of April 2011, on my Department&rsquo;s website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department&rsquo;s aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.In relation to the NEWB, there have been two appointments to the Board since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Mr. Brendan Broderick was appointed based on a nomination of the trade unions and staff associations representing teachers under S9(2)(1)(b)(iv) of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.Mr. Broderick was a direct replacement of a retiring nominee during his term of office. Mr. Eamonn Flynn was appointed to the NEWB based on a nomination of the Educational Welfare Officers under S9 (2)(1)(b)(v) of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 whereby the Minister is obliged to consult with specified bodies in the process of these appointments.</P>
        <P>In relation to the FSA, there have been nine members appointed to the Board since my appointment as Minister, namely Sharon Foley, Dick Hickey, Catherine Hazlett , Marie Fenlon, Yvette O&rsquo;Malley (resigned 10 November, 2011), Liz Chaloner, Nuala Ryan, Imelda Martin and Caroline Murphy. I will be writing shortly to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to advise that the Chairperson designate will be available for interview by the committee.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. I am in the process of making appointments to the board of management of the schools and will announce the full board when all members have been appointed.The term of the previous Board expired in October 2011 and the vacancies for the current Board are currently listed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>I have made no appointments to the Board of the AAI since my appointment.There is no Board for the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.  The new arrangements introduced by this Government with regard to the availability of designated candidates for interview by Oireachtas Committee will apply as appropriate in the case of chairpersons of boards and I can confirm that there have been no situations in my Department where this process has not occurred.</P>

It is my intention to seek approval from Government for the proposed wording once finalised, with a view to holding the referendum next year.  I am anxious to ensure that any wording which emerges will have the support it needs across parties and with the public. The timing of the referendum will have regard to the need to allow an appropriate period of time for the proposal to be fully communicated to the public. Not withstanding that I am committed to advancing the referendum at as early a date in 2012 as possible.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 556 and 557 together.</P>
        <P>Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo; and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources. All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care, high support, or special care are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education in which he/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years of age.</P>
        <P>Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age. These young people continue in education and training as planned. This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care. Children who have been in residential care, short term foster placements, multiple placements and those who have dropped out of education/training are most at risk and in need of support when they leave care. The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training and social support. Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young person&rsquo;s need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education in the months before their 18th birthday. The level of support required will vary for each individual.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 45 dedicated Aftercare workers in the HSE and recruitment of 10 additional aftercare workers is currently underway. In addition, many social workers while not dedicated aftercare workers, provide aftercare as part of their workload. The HSE also provides <Col N="560" />funding and has agreements in place with a number of bodies including Focus Ireland, Clare Care and Simon, to provide full-time aftercare workers.</P>
        <P>The National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which has been developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders including the voluntary sector agencies involved in Aftercare provision and my  Department. The policy commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people.The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those that have dropped out of education and training and those that have left residential care. Some of these  young people have mental health problems or a disability. The HSE is alert to this group and the implementation group is working together to improve their circumstances. The HSE has committed to monitor implementation of this policy in the 2012 National Service Plan. I will review demand and update of the service over the course of 2012, with a view to assessing how the service is addressing need.</P>

        <P>The Forum on Fluoridation, which reported in 2002, advised that the fluoridation of piped public water supplies should continue as a public health measure. One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm. Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. The report of the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published in June 2011, has not made any findings of negative health or environmental effects concerning fluoridation of water. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <P>While I have no plans at present to introduce a pilot no-fault compensation scheme for children who suffer catastrophic birth injuries, this is an area I am asking my Department to explore.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, I am advised that the Working Group on Medical Negligence and Periodic Payments, established by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Kearns, and chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke, is currently working on its report concerning the introduction of a Clinical Negligence Pre-action Protocol in Ireland, similar to that which operates in England and Wales. The purpose of introducing such a Protocol, which would have special application to cases involving catastrophic birth-related injuries, is to ensure the resolution of such cases as soon as is possible without the necessity for litigation. If adopted, this approach would save on legal costs and, importantly, preserve the patient/health care provider relationship. I understand that the introduction of such a pre-action protocol would require a statutory amendment to permit the necessary changes to the Rules of Superior Courts.</P>
        <P>The Working Group referred to above has already made recommendations regarding the introduction of legislation to facilitate courts making provision for structured settlements or &lsquo;periodic payment orders&rsquo; in circumstances where lump sums are currently awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another. These reform initiatives are ultimately a matter of responsibility for the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 567 together.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the impact the early retirement package will have on the provision of maternity services and indeed all services nationally and together with the HSE, we are committed to minimizing the impact through a range of strategies to be achieved through fast tracking new innovative and more efficient ways of using a reducing resource.  I have requested the HSE to prioritise the ongoing delivery of safe services for patients and to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to ensure the avoidance of risk in the delivery of services for patients. <Col N="563" /> The impact of the upcoming retirements requires a range of strategic national responses, together with specific local responses.</P>
        <P>Planning for the delivery of health services is undertaken within the context of the annual National Service Planning process. This process ensures that all factors, including budgets and staffing levels and any other emerging issues, including the impact of the retirements are factored into the plan for what services will be delivered within the coming year.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process, each of the HSE&rsquo;s four regions are required to develop a more detailed Regional Service Plan which translates the national goals and targets into service specific targets for the year in question. All of the regional plans are being developed on the basis of the anticipated number of staff that will be in post after the end of February. These plans are due to be finalized in early February. Managing the specific risks associated with the forthcoming retirements has been undertaken within this planning context and will form part of the soon to be published Regional Service Plans. Contingency plans are being developed to cover any gaps that may arise in staffing as a result of midwives retiring at the end of February. Many of these contingency plans are at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>The scope to replace the staff who will retire is limited. Addressing the reduction in staff numbers as a result of these retirements, as well as the wider programme of reducing public sector numbers, requires more significant productivity increases as well as organisational and work practice changes.</P>
        <P>The HSE is continuing to utilize the provisions of the Public Service Agreement 2010 to 2014 (the &ldquo;Croke Park Agreement&rdquo;) as it seeks to change staff rosters, work practices and to redeploy staff.  This will assist in minimising the service impact. Contingency plans to address the impact of the retirements also focus on the following measures:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Staff Redeployment &mdash; Staff redeployment options are being progressed across all services.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Streamlining- Some management structures and services will be amalgamated and streamlined, Cross cover arrangements will be put in place wherever possible and where clinical management numbers have been reduced. In addition revised staff rosters and skill mix options are also being utilized.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Delivering Greater Productivity through the National Clinical Programmes.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          The accelerated implementation of the national clinical programmes are key strategic supports to the risk management process which is in place around these retirements.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          The related work of the Special Delivery Unit in relation to emergency departments, surgical and outpatient waiting times and reorganisation of specialist medical services and bed utilisation, will also be critical in supporting the achievement of overall resource management in the coming year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are a number of additional allocations set out in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service plan that will assist in minimising the impact of the retirements on services, to include:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Focused Recruitment for critical posts vacated will be undertaken (within the context of the cost containment plans and budgets for each service).</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          Agency staff may be used where there is a critical requirement. Any reliance on agency staff will be in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s objective to reduce overall agency costs by 50% in 2012.</P>
        <Col N="564" />
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="mdash66" />
          
          The National Service plan in 2012 also makes provision for some conversion of agency costs into whole time equivalent staff which will be explored in limited circumstances where local budgets allow.</P>

        <P>The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 in 2012.</P>
        <P>The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to submit, as a matter of urgency, its assessment of the likely impact of retirements to the end of February, to identify particular pressure points and to develop <Col N="565" />appropriate measures to deal with significant departures in a given service or area.  I also intend to review the Service Plan once the full impact of the staff leaving at the end of the 29 February &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; is known.</P>
        <P>The reduction in staffing increases the need for reform, including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, as well as redeployment.  The HSE National Service Plan includes a commitment to addressing these issues within the context of the Public Service Agreement.  It also commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources, including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters (especially of nursing and medical staff).</P>
        <P>While a significant number of doctors, nurses and other professional and support staff are due to retire by the end of February, there is no scope for widespread rehiring of staff.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy in relation to services in County Louth, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&rsquo;s mental health services.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes based on an early intervention and a recovery approach.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care specifically for people with mental health problems.  Some provision will also be made to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>Details of how this funding will be apportioned are set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2012 which was approved by the Minister in accordance with the Health Act 2004.</P>

        <P>General Practitioners (GPs) who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  For instance, in circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) diagnose a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.   The HSE points out that, in many GP surgeries, it is the practice nurse who takes blood samples and that it significantly subsidises the cost of employing practice nurses.</P>
        <P>At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in this regard.  I would encourage patients to follow up with the HSE if they believe they are being wrongly charged for services by their GP and the matter will be fully investigated by the Executive.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE&rsquo;s Consumer Affairs Service.  In a number of cases to-date, the GP has reimbursed their patients following receipt of correspondence from the HSE.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>The health sector is facing significant funding challenges this year because of the economic crisis and the need to put public finances on a sustainable basis.  </P>
        <P>However as Minister for Health I am determined that the impact on services must be minimised by relentless performance management, by best practice and by reform in how services are delivered. This will apply in all settings and services and for those delivering those services.</P>
        <P>Towards the end of 2011 Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (OLOL) in Drogheda was identified as one of eight hospitals that required very high support by the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in relation to trolley waits.  Based on proposals received from the hospital I agreed that additional funding would be provided, on a strictly once off basis, to help reduce ED waiting times over November and December 2011.   The funding was to provide for initiatives which would help address issues such as delayed discharges which have a significant impact on the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys.  This was done on the basis that the hospital/HSE would continue any measures necessary to alleviate trolley waits in January.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;725,000 was approved in respect of Our Lady of Lourdes to address trolley waits at the hospital and to implement the various initiatives that had been identified as being key to alleviating the conditions in the emergency department at the hospital over the period.</P>
        <P>These measures included:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Extending the Medical Assessment Unit service opening hours in OLOL.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Opening additional beds in OLOL.</P>
        <Col N="572" />
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Various measures for early assisted discharge for medically fit patients including privately provided interim care, the provision of home IVs, and additional aids and appliances.</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Assisted discharge packages and extension of community rehabilitation team.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition the initiative included the temporary provision of interim/stepdown beds in Louth County Hospital. This involved a medical ward at Louth County Hospital being opened on a temporary basis to cater for clinically discharged patients from Our Lady of Lourdes.  Over the Christmas period, due to the number of patients going home for short periods, this and other wards were reconfigured to ensure the best use of resources. Since then due to a reduction in the number of clinically discharged patients requiring this service, and the unavailability of agency staff the temporary beds concerned have not reopened.</P>
        <P>Over &euro;4.8m was made available to 16 hospitals throughout the country for specific planned outcomes. The SDU established a process of collecting numbers waiting on trolleys in each Hospital ED on a daily basis at three specific times and rating each hospital as Green, Amber or Red.  To date, the initiative has worked well nationally with trolley numbers significantly down on the same period last year. The systems remains in a state of high alert to ensure that overall capacity,that is both surgical and medical capacity is carefully managed.  The SDU Liaison Officer is continuing to work with Our Lady of Lourdes on these issues.</P>
        <P>I would also like to advise the Deputy that OLOL was successful in achieving the objective of having no one waiting over 12 months for inpatient or day case surgery by December 31st 2011.  Forty one hospitals reached this target with only two hospitals not achieving it.  This work will continue in 2012 to both maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time and to further reduce waiting times by the end of 2012.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>No retired staff have been rehired by my Department since I became Minister for Health.</P>
        <P>It was a specific condition of the 2010 Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) scheme that persons availing of the scheme would not be eligible for re-employment in the public health sector <b>or</b> in the wider public service <b>or</b> in a body wholly or mainly funded from public moneys. The same prohibition on re-employment applied under the Voluntary Redundancy (VR) scheme also, except that the prohibition will be for a period of seven years, after which time any re-employment will require the approval of the Minister for Finance (now the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform). These provisions also apply in the case of re-engagement on a contract for service.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the form of acceptance, public service employers must inquire of relevant future job applicants if they have availed of the terms of either of these schemes and adhere to the conditions outlined above.</P>
        <P>In relation to a person who retired upon reaching retirement age, or retired early preserving pension benefits, there are no restrictions upon them applying for a position through normal recruitment/selection procedures.  There are, however, provisions in most public service pension schemes to ensure that the combined earnings (pension plus pay) of a retired public servant who takes up public service employment, does not exceed the remuneration which they would have received had they remained in the former employment.  This is known as abatement of pension.</P>
        <P>Information relating to any rehiring of former public servants by the health service in 2011 will not be available until late February/early March and will be supplied direct to the Deputy (by the HSE) as soon as it is available.</P>
        <P>The information concerning the State agencies under the aegis of my Department is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the reasons that persons who contracted hepatitis from contaminated products after 2007 do not qualify for the supports made available, despite the fact that they continue to suffer with ongoing illness while many other persons tested negative yet are also excluded form the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt>

        <P>I presume that  the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the women who received Anti-D in the periods 1977-1979 and also 1991-1994, when some batches of these blood products were contaminated, but who have tested negative for the Hepatitis C virus.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Amendment Act (No. 15 of 1996) the Health Amendment Act (HAA) Card is given to men, women and children who contracted Hepatitis C from the administration within the State of blood or blood products.  The HAA Card gives entitlements to additional <Col N="576" />health and social services, on more flexible terms and conditions than the medical card.  The HAA Card and the entitlements under it are for the lifetime of the cardholder.</P>
        <P>The entitlement of an individual to a Health Amendment (HAA) Card and services under the Health (Amendment) Act, l996 rests with the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive.  The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the definition of eligibility in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received by the Tribunal after the specified date of 20 June, 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of persons who made an application before that date, the Chief Executive Officer is still obliged to be satisfied that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C.  In that regard, the Chief Executive also takes account of any relevant decision of the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, on the basis that the Tribunal arrives at its decisions after careful consideration of available evidence and expert testimony.</P>
        <P>A great deal of consideration has been given to the issue of women who have neither tested positive for Hepatitis C, nor had a positive Tribunal decision in their favour.  While a number of these women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C have had, and may continue to have, a variety of symptoms, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression, are common conditions that occur in the general population. It is estimated that up to 16,000 women were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C.</P>
        <P>Taking account of international practice and the rationale which led to the clarification of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal eligibility requirements in 2006, while I am sympathetic to the women in question, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are fair and reasonable.</P>

        <P>The Government is committed to a reduction in public service numbers to 282,500 by 2015.  This represents a reduction of 37,500, or 12% of staff, compared to 2008 levels.  The health service must make an appropriate contribution to this reduction.  The National Service Plan 2012 sets out the level of reduction required in the current year. The Plan provides for all possible steps to minimise the effect of staffing reductions on services. These include pursuing to the maximum the flexibility and reform agenda provided for in the Public Service Agreement. In particular, it is essential that we bring about change in relation to rostering (especially of nursing and medical staff), skill-mix, a reduction in the use of agency staff and the continued implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s clinical programmes.</P>
        <P>The current Employment Control Framework for the health sector gives the HSE some flexibility in relation to filling posts in order to protect frontline services in so far as possible while still achieving the required targets. In addition, the Public Service Agreement allows the HSE to redeploy staff based on service need. Nevertheless, the overall target reduction in numbers must be met, which will undoubtedly pose a significant challenge.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform public procurement.  In addition, the recently published Public Service Reform Plan addresses reform of public procurement processes, reducing costs, addressing duplication and eliminating waste.   </P>
        <P>HSE procurement includes all of the activities involved between the identification of a requirement for goods or services through to acquisition.   The Executive has introduced a Single National Procurement Operating Model to support and deliver procurement. This integrated model has:</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Been a key enabler in maximising purchasing power in the market place and achieving best value for money;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Facilitated more efficient operations in terms of standardised processes and reduced duplication of effort, thereby reducing the time and effort spent on transactional processing;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Improved business intelligence and reporting: Improving quality and timeliness of information, thus placing greater emphasis on reporting and business decision support;</P>
        <P LI="1">

          Improved compliance and control: Greater transparency in the use of public funds, leading to better value for money;</P>
        <P LI="1">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          Introduced management of stock at point of use &mdash; this is where procurement staff have become involved in management of stock, for example, at ward level. As part of the consolidation exercise procurement staff will be available and trained to manage stock at point of use on behalf of our customer base.  The Point of Use concept  is now being aggressively progressed.  During 2011, it has been rolled out in a number of high tech clinical areas resulting in:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">
          <Miles com="bull66" />
          
          30% stock reduction (approx).</P>
        <P LI="3">
          <Miles com="bull66" />

          A Framework Agreement in relation to Managed Services for Aids and Appliances is now in place.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition the HSE works closely with the National Procurement Services and the Steering Group for Reform to progress Value for Money Initiatives across the Public Sector.   During 2011 HSE Procurement achieved savings in excess of &euro;74m.  Efficiencies and value delivered across HSE Procurement were against a backdrop of a 4.6% decrease in staffing levels.</P>
        <P>In respect of purchases under the value of &euro;20,000, the threshold laid down within the Financial Regulations apply, that is, three quotations would be sought from the supply base to ensure value is being achieved in respect of these purchases.</P>

        <P>The HSE continues to engage with suppliers to ensure they understand how to do business with HSE and to ensure that HSE maximises competition available.  During 2011 in excess of 500 engagements took place and in addition there were also a number of high level engagements.</P>
        <P>I expect that the Executive will continue with its efforts to achieve value for money and the generation of savings during 2012.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>This Government is committed to introducing a better and more efficient health system, a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.  The development of primary care services is an essential component of the health service reform process.  In a developed primary care system, up to 95 per cent of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting. </P>
        <P>Primary Care Teams are being developed, which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  Additional services such as Speech and Language Therapy may be provided on a sessional basis.  There are currently 425 Primary Care Teams in place, albeit at varying stages of development.  The HSE has committed in its Service Plan to having 489 operational teams in place by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Each Primary Care Team will be supported by a wider range of professionals, including pharmacists, dieticians, psychologists and chiropodists who will form a Health and Social Care Network.  The vast majority of specialist based services will be organised at this level, e.g. Mental Health Community Team, Child Protection, etc.</P>
        <P>Primary Care Teams will also create an environment which enables, structured approaches to chronic disease management, enhanced multi-disciplinary team working, improved diagnostic capabilities in Primary Care and the integration of services between primary and secondary care.  The HSE Service Plan also commits the HSE to commencing a national roll out of chronic disease management for diabetes during 2012 and that it will also progress preparations for the roll out of similar initiatives in relation to other chronic diseases, including stroke, asthma and heart failure.</P>
        <P>A key commitment in the Programme for Government and a fundamental element in the health reform process involves universal primary care with removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals. Access to primary care without fees will be extended on a phased basis over the life of this Government.  Initially, free GP cover will be extended to persons in receipt of drugs and medicines under the Long-Term Illness Scheme. Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  It is expected that the new arrangements will be in place by this Summer.  I have established the Universal <Col N="581" />Primary Care Project Team, which has been tasked with working through the issues relating to this commitment.  The Project Team held its first meeting on 24 January.</P>
        <P>A further element of the reform process will see the appointment of a number of directors at national level within the HSE, one of which will have responsibility for Primary Care.  This will reflect the need for greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services; and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.</P>
        <P>I will also ensure that a ring-fenced primary care budget is put in place.  This will facilitate people in receiving a comprehensive health service in the community, which will in turn facilitate earlier identification of conditions and will give people a much better chance of recovery.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for in-patient or day case surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <P>The Government has decided, on foot of my recommendations, that the VHI should make an application for authorisation by the Central Bank, subject to further Government decisions to be made relating to capitalisation, once the level of its capital shortfall is clarified.  The VHI has been working for some time in preparation for this.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Commission took a case against the State regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which had exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last.  VHI&rsquo;s regulatory status is bound up in a range of issues relating to the private health insurance market which I have been addressing over the past number of months.  In order to be considered for authorisation by the Central Bank, VHI will need to present a sustainable business plan.  Due to the current imbalance of the community rated private health insurance market, where the vast majority of claims are paid out by the VHI, the market requires an effective scheme of risk equalisation to address that imbalance.  Work is ongoing in my Department to legislate for such an effective, robust and permanent scheme in the coming months, following the Government&rsquo;s recent agreement to my proposals in that regard.  The new scheme will need to be cleared at EU level in relation to State Aid rules.  In the meantime, on foot of recommendations of the Health Insurance Authority following its analysis of the market, the level of age-related tax credits payable in 2012 in respect of customers over the age of 60 has been significantly increased.</P>
        <P>Following the Court of Justice judgment, the Government made decisions on how best to address the Court&rsquo;s findings.  The Governments plans and a realistic timetable were outlined to the European Commission on 9 December last.  Resolution of the issues will involve a number of steps.  The timescale for some of these steps is outside of the State&rsquo;s control and will depend on the time it takes for decisions to be made by the European Commission itself regarding State Aid issues, as well as by the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>Once it is clear, following the analysis of the Central Bank and the European Commission, what additional capital the VHI would require in order to secure authorisation and to satisfy any State Aid implications which may arise, the Government will consider the matter and make further decisions in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is clear that all of these actions must be undertaken in an orderly and efficient manner but that this will take time.  The timescale outlined to the European Commission is intended to allow for these issues to be addressed in such an orderly and efficient way.  Officials from my Department remain in contact with the European Commission on an ongoing basis and will work to satisfy the Commission&rsquo;s concerns and to advance the resolution of the regulatory status of the VHI as quickly as possible.</P>

        <P>I recently announced the agreement reached with the country&rsquo;s main health insurers to establish a Health Insurance Consultative Forum to tackle issues of mutual concern.  The purpose of this Forum is twofold.  </P>
        <P>Firstly, the Forum will provide the opportunity for participating parties to examine how costs in the health insurance sector can be reduced and how savings can be achieved in terms of services provided by both public and private hospitals.  Secondly, the Forum will also facilitate participating parties to consider certain issues related to the implementation of Universal Health Insurance (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.  The Forum will allow the insurance companies consult with my Department on many significant changes on the road to the full implementation of UHI.</P>
        <P>Details on the membership and terms of reference for the Forum are currently being considered and I will announce these in due course.</P>

        <P>The Government is committed to fundamental reform of the health system.  This will see the delivery of a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which will ensure equal access to care based on need, not income.  The universal health insurance system will be based on the principle of social solidarity.  Every citizen will have a choice of insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.  </P>
        <P>Key features of the reform programme which will underpin the introduction of universal health insurance include:</P>

        <P>Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants. </P>
        <P>As the Regulations were drafted in 1996, they require updating in terms of the monetary amounts and some medical and surgical practices specified therein. The consumer price index, health cost inflation for hospital services and hospital charges have all increased significantly from that time. In addition, there have been significant changes in some medical and surgical practices in the last number of years.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the Minimum Benefit Regulations need to be reviewed in order to reflect changes in medical practice as well as changes to the costs of health services. It is intended that the current regulations will be examined over the coming months as part of the overall strategy to address issues in the private health insurance market, leading in to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.</P>

        <P>The General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme allows GMS patients (medical card and GP visit card holders) to choose their GP from a list of locally based contracted doctors, or GMS patients may be assigned to a GP contractor&rsquo;s panel in certain circumstances specified in the contract.  The <Col N="586" />purpose of a GMS patient either choosing or being assigned to one GP is to ensure continuity of care.</P>
        <P>The GMS contract also provides that a patient who is a &ldquo;temporary resident&rdquo; in another area of the State may obtain a service from an available GMS contractor holder in that area in an emergency.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 2,600 GPs in active practice, of which almost 2,300 hold a contract with the HSE for the provision of services under the GMS Scheme to medical card and GP visit card patients.The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support provides for the introduction of legislation to remove restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients under the GMS Scheme.The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill, which has just passed through the D&aacute;il and is due in the Seanad in early February, will eliminate current restrictions on fully qualified and trained GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the GMS contract and will empower the Minister for Health to set entry terms based on public health and public interest considerations.This legislation will result in medical card and GP visit card patients having a greater choice of GPs under the GMS Scheme.It will also help to ensure that private patients of new GP contract holders who qualify for a medical card or GP visit card will not have to change their GP.</P>

        <P>At the request of my colleague, Dr James Reilly, Minister for Health, the HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.

Preparations for implementation are continuing to ensure that every element of the screening programme is in place and fully quality assured before the programme is introduced.</P>
        <P>The initial 15 colonoscopy units selected as candidate screening colonoscopy units for the programme must meet accreditation requirements, as determined by the NCSS Quality Assurance Committee, to achieve confirmed status as screening colonoscopy units.

        <P>Roscommon is one of 36 hospitals providing endoscopy services. It therefore provides colonoscopy and other screening endoscopy services for patients referred by their GPs for these screening services.</P>

        <P>I propose to answer Questions 654 and 672 together.</P>
        <P>I presented proposals for &ldquo;The Gathering 2013&rdquo; at last October&rsquo;s 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the lead agency for the implementation of The Gathering initiative while Tourism Ireland Limited will have specific responsibility for promoting &ldquo;The Gathering 2013&rdquo; in overseas markets.  The event is intended to be the biggest tourism initiative ever staged in Ireland and will consist of a year-long programme of festivals, events and other gatherings in every region of the country, all of which will aim to attract overseas visitors.</P>
        <P>As outlined at the Global Irish Economic Forum, the initiative is being overseen by a small, tightly-focused Project Board.  This project board brings together representatives of the tourism bodies and my Department and includes other members with relevant expertise who are contributing on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.  The Chair of the Board is Ann Riordan (formerly Chair of Tourism Ireland and of Dublin Tourism, as well as previously working as Country Manager for Microsoft in Ireland) and the Board will oversee planning and delivery of the Gathering, supported by a small executive team drawn mainly from the tourism agencies alongside graduates under the JobBridge programme.</P>
        <P>They will be supported by a Council of Champions, which will act as a forum to engage the wider community at home and abroad to provide support.  Tim O&rsquo;Connor, former Secretary-General to the President, will act as Chair of the Council of Champions and he is also a member of the Project Board.  The Project Board is currently finalising the Business Plan for &ldquo;The Gathering 2013&rdquo; which will detail the scope of the event and the necessary resources to implement it.</P>

        <P>I have examined the correspondence provided by the Deputy.  The correspondent also wrote to me directly last year on this matter.  I consider it essential that a good communications process is in place between the Road Safety Authority and the Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) in relation to the operation of Essential Driver Training (EDT).  I have expressed that view to both the RSA and representatives of the ADIs. </P>
        <P>It is my understanding that the RSA established a Stakeholders Forum for regular engagement between the RSA and ADIs, and that the ADIs representatives are elected on a regional basis.  In addition, the RSA has informed me that it also use emails, SMS texts, newsletters and its website as mechanisms for keeping ADIs informed of developments.  I understand that the Forum has since discussed improvements to communications between the RSA and ADIs, and that new measures at local level are now in place.  The RSA has assured me that they will keep the operation of the Forum and all aspects of its communications strategy open to review and will take appropriate action where necessary.  The next election to membership of the Forum is in October 2012.</P>
        <P>In relation to the specific question of the introduction of Essential Driver Training, I understand that the RSA engaged in a discussion and information process with ADIs during the lead-in.  I consider that the structures exist for good communication between the RSA and ADIs, and that there would seem to be a willingness by the RSA to adapt these structures as necessary.</P>

        <P>The current expenditure for regional and local roads will be reduced significantly over the next few years.  Cuts of the magnitude proposed necessitated that some very good and worthwhile projects be curtailed. </P>
        <P>In making adjustments to the regional and local roads budget the primary aim has been, as far as is possible, to protect previous investment in the road network and use the  available funding to maintain and restore public roads, including those in rural areas.  Given that priority it is not possible to assist with any works on non-public roads. </P>
        <P>While the importance of this scheme to rural communities and in assisting local development projects on non-public accommodation roads is acknowledged, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.</P>
        <P>However, the scheme has been suspended and not abolished. If and when the financial position of the State improves, it will be possible to re-open this scheme.  In the interim, it is open to local authorities to continue to operate the scheme or a similar scheme from their own resources and I am sure they will do if they consider it to be a good use of limited resources.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The information requested by the Deputy regarding appointments to State Boards is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Since my Department advertised new procedures for appointments to State boards on Friday 8th April 2011, all appointments from that date have followed these pro<Col N="594" />cedures.  All Chairpersons whom I have appointed, with the exception of Mr. Tom Wall, have appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>I appointed Mr. Wall as Chairperson of the RPA on an interim basis until 18 April 2012 pending the merger of the RPA and the National Roads Authority. Given the short nature of his appointment, it was not considered necessary for him to appear before the Committee.  The Chairperson for the merged body will be designated in advance of the completion of the merger and will appear before the Committee prior to his/her appointment.</P>

Five of these were Radio Officers to fill essential frontline vacancies in the Coast Guard until such time as recruitment processes for replacements could be completed.  One Aeronautical Engineer was rehired for the Air Accident Investigation Unit.  A retired official was contracted to carry out a specific evaluation exercise.  Where retired civil servants are re-engaged, pension abatement applies.</P>

        <P>The current expenditure for regional and local roads will be reduced significantly over the next few years.  Cuts of the magnitude proposed necessitated that some very good and worthwhile projects be curtailed <Col N="596" />including those normally carried out under the Local Improvements Scheme, for which funding has been suspended.  </P>
        
        <P>In making adjustments to the regional and local roads budget the primary aim has been, as far as is possible, to protect previous investment in the road network and use the  available funding to maintain and restore public roads, including those in rural areas.  Given that priority it is not possible to assist with any works on non-public roads. </P>
        <P>While the importance of this scheme to rural communities and in assisting local development projects on non-public accommodation roads is acknowledged, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance a matter for the relevant landowner. </P>
        <P>However, the scheme has been suspended and not abolished. If and when the financial position of the State improves, it will be possible to re-open this scheme.  In the interim, it is open to local authorities to continue to operate the scheme or a similar scheme from their own resources and I am sure they will do if they consider it to be a good use of limited resources.</P>

        <P>In 2005, the Protocol of 1997 to MARPOL, providing for the prevention of air pollution from ships, known as MARPOL Annex VI, entered into force.  The provisions of this Protocol were implemented in full through the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006.  MARPOL Annex VI provides, <i>inter alia</i>  , sulphur content limits for fuel used in shipping, in recognition of the fact that sulphur emissions into the air significantly damage both human health (mainly through causing respiratory problems and cardiac ill-health) and the environment (e.g. through acidification on land). Shipping now represents a disproportionate source of such emissions and its emissions are anticipated to exceed those of land based sources in the future. Passenger ships in the EU operate mostly in ports or close to coastal areas and their impacts on human health are significant, hence the need to address this source of pollution.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns of the shipping industry, particularly in relation to potential fuel cost increases and its implications for connectivity and ferry operations in the Irish Sea.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2008, an amendment to MARPOL Annex VI regulations, introduces lower sulphur limits in fuel from 3.5% to 0.1% in sea areas designated Emission Control Areas (ECA&rsquo;s) from 1 January 2015. However, as the seas around Ireland have not been designated an ECA these lower limits do not currently apply to Irish passenger ships operating in the Irish Sea. ECAs are designated by agreement of the parties to the IMO. Within the EU, the only ECAs are the North Sea and the Baltic. Currently, Ireland has no plans or evidence to support the introduction of an ECA in the Irish Sea by 2015. MARPOL Annex VI also reduces the sulphur content in fuels for global shipping (outside ECAs) from 3.5% to 0.5% in 2020.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, under EU legislation passenger ships must use fuel with a sulphur content of 1.5% or lower. This includes passenger ships operating in the Irish Sea. In July 2011 the European Commission introduced a proposal to revise Directive1999/32/EC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. The proposal seeks to lower sulphur content in fuel from 1.5% for passenger ships to 0.1% in 2020, but some Member States are seeking an earlier date of 2015. Ireland supports the 2020 date. Several Member States, especially those whose waters are already designated ECA&rsquo;s, are seeking to have all the waters of the EU designated as a ECA and that lower limits of 0.1% apply to passenger ships from 2015.  Ireland has not and is not supporting this position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Officials from my Department are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) to represent Ireland&rsquo;s national <Col N="599" />position at EU level where my Department has highlighted the concerns of the shipping industry. Discussions are continuing at EU working party level on this matter.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</askee>
        <Quest> the EU Council of Ministers on which he sits; the number of meetings of that Council that have been held between 2007 and 2011; the number of those meetings that he attended; the number that were attended by the relevant Minister of State; the number that were attended by an Irish official; and if he will provide the names of those who attended in tabular form. </Quest>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
        <P>Within my remit, there are three Council formations of relevance: Transport, Telecoms and Energy (TTE) Council; Competitiveness Council (which deals with tourism-related issues from time to time); and Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYCS) Council.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the TTE Council is concerned, I have attended all 4 Transport Councils since I became Minister in March 2011. Details of attendance of my predecessors at Transport Councils are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the Competitiveness Council is concerned, my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton, T.D., represents Ireland at the Competitiveness Council and there have been no significant issues relating to tourism at this Council since I took office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Insofar as the EYCS Council is concerned, Minister of State Michael Ring T.D. has delegated responsibility in relation to EU matters relating to Sport and he has attended one of the two Council meetings scheduled since he took office. He was unable to attend the Council meeting in May 2011 owing to diary commitments associated with the visit of HM Queen Elizabeth II. Sport has only become a formal part of this Council since the Lisbon Treaty came into force and as such there were only two Council meetings of Sports Ministers in 2010, neither of which was attended by an Irish Minister.</P>

        <P>Essential Driver Training (EDT), which I introduced last April, requires learner car drivers to undertake a course of compulsory lessons before taking the driving test.  EDT is one of nine components in the development of a Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) system for Ireland.  Taken together, these components will contribute significantly to the quality of driving on our roads, and so to road safety.</P>
        <P>The development of detailed proposals for the GDL was undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), and the process included extensive consultation during 2009.  EDT was one of the specific proposals to be developed following this exercise. </P>
        <P>I understand from the RSA that it engaged extensively with Approved Driving Instructors during the development process for the EDT programme itself.</P>
