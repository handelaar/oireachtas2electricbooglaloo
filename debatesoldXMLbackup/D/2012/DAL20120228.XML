      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
        <P>The latest information from across the public service indicates that 7,464 people have applied to retire in the first two months of the year.  The sectorial breakdown of applications is health, 2,567; education, 2,058; Civil Service, 1,236; local authority, 931; defence, 362; and Garda, 310.  This gives a total of 7,464.</P>
        <P>When public service salaries were reduced in 2010, it was agreed by the then Government that persons retiring during a transitional, or grace, period would have their retirement benefits calculated on the basis of the previous payscale levels before the salary cut.  That grace period will expire on 29 February 2012 in accordance with the law.  Public service managers have known about the grace period for the past 18 months and have therefore had a long time to plan accordingly.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Government has ensured that transition teams have been put in place in each of the sectors to deal with the specific short-term challenges arising from the ending of the grace period and to manage the process in their respective sectors.  These teams are drawn from the existing workforce planning groups that have been in place for many months.</P>
        <P>The transition teams have reported on their plans to manage the reduction in staff numbers arising from retirements to end-February and I have brought these proposals to Government.  Based on the information received from the transition teams, I am satisfied that due consideration has been given by each of the sectors to the impact of the staffing reductions and the most appropriate and expeditious ways of managing the changes.  The departures represent less than 3% of staff serving in the public service.  Therefore, it would be unduly alarmist to categorise the exit as a &ldquo;wave&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>As they have the most current information on service provision at a local level, each sectoral transition team has been directed to actively communicate with the public via whichever means appropriate in order to allay concerns with regard to critical front-line service delivery.  Public concerns about service levels should be addressed proactively and the public should be kept informed of business continuity arrangements that are being put in place.  In the case of the Civil Service, material from the transition team process is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  For information on the wider public service, I would advise Members of the House to look at individual departmental websites.</P>
        <P>Beyond the February 2012 grace period deadline, the strategic workforce planning groups in each sector will continue to ensure that sectoral employers develop plans to deal on an ongoing basis with the operational and strategic consequences of the changes and to keep the public informed step by step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue.  The Minister gave a general outline of the numbers leaving but he did not give any commitments in practice on the ground in terms of front line services.  He has said that 2,567 people are leaving the health service in this eight week period, coupled with 1,800 who left immediately before Christmas.  The 4,300 staff leaving the health service will cause problems on the front line, especially nursing grades.  Every time we have spoken on this topic we speak about nursing grades.  I believe Ministers are asking the Minister for concessions on Revenue staff and other staff.  There should be a concession on a significant redeployment of nursing grade staff.  This morning on the radio we heard that circulars have been sent to nursing unions suggesting a change from the 12-hour shift to a six-hour shift basis.  If that is emerging in the 24 hours prior to people retiring, how can the Minister possibly expect proper arrangements to be put in place?</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify the position on staff in the Department of Social Protection?  Given that 246 staff are leaving, will the Minister ensure there will not be a further increase in delays in terms of processing means-tested payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance and that arrangements will be in place for the appeals office with the line Minister, as some appeals are running over 12 months at the moment in cases where there is an oral hearing?</P>
        <P>I am aware the Cabinet again discussed filling key vacancies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In my constituency the chief superintendent has retired and two superintendents have retired in County Laois but there has not been any information about replacing them.  Will the Minister give a commitment before this week is out on the filling of those posts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of questions were asked.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s general concern on the matter.  The exit at the end of this month is of the order of 3% of the public service.  It is one of which we have had much notice and a lot of strategic planning has been ongoing.  I cannot guarantee that there will not be a glitch because it will be the area in which we least expected a problem to arise.  However, I do expect managers at local level to address problems as they arise and to solve them.</P>
        <P>In terms of the specific points made, as the Deputy is aware, some nursing grades are not subject to the moratorium and they can be replaced immediately.  Some &euro;16 million is available to the HSE to fill critical grades.  As all consultant posts are outside the embargo, they can be filled.</P>
        <P>We need to examine different ways of delivering services.  The process of downsizing the public service is being done in tandem with delivering services differently.  The Deputy mentioned the Garda.  Garda rosters have been in place since the 1970s, yet people have been trying to change them to put the maximum number of garda&iacute; on the beat at the points and times they are most needed and the least number at the points and times they are least needed.  This level of flexibility has not existed to date, but it will from 1 April.  Across the public service, this level of flexibility is being found.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection has a large volume of staff.  Indeed, its staff levels have increased, given the influx of community welfare officers and the F&Aacute;S cohort.  Some of the latter went to the Department of Education and Skills.  There will be redeployment, as there has been already.  All of the issues in question will be addressed.</P>
        <P>In the past fortnight, the Government approved 32 &mdash; I am going from memory &mdash; senior Garda appointments.  We are reviewing staffing requirements on a case by case basis.  Perhaps we can now consider what the best management structures for the public service are, including agencies and the Garda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is 3% of the entirety of the public service.  The Minister referred to the extent of the planning done to date and the advance notice given in respect of the incentivised retirement package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not incentivised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, actually.  One would not ordinarily see this type of exodus from the service without a clear incentive being in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not had sight of the individual sectoral reports that the Minister stated were on each Department&rsquo;s website, but I have with me the Civil Service sectoral plan.  The contingency plans are contained in an appendix to the document, which can <Col N="4"/>be found on the Minister&rsquo;s departmental website.  What is striking is the fact that the appendix is scant on detail.  It repeatedly makes assertions that redeployment will be the first port of call, but that the Government will be seeking additional sanctioned posts.  The appendix does not supply numbers in that regard.  Commitments on protecting front line services are made.  The Courts Service has helpfully stated that it hopes to keep the courts operational, yet it is losing nearly 60 personnel.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence of the type of detailed, robust planning that the Minister claims has been under way for some time.  Will he give the House a stronger sense of the planning in respect of the Courts Service and our health services?  Some 500 mental health nurses are due to exit the system.  Money has been ring-fenced for 400 new personnel, but that will leave us 100 short.  This is the mathematics of it.  There comes a point at which one cannot do more with less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the last question first.  The mathematics of it is that we are downsizing.  It is a falsehood to claim that, after reducing the full quantum, one must add everyone back again.  The idea is to do things better and more efficiently and to change work practices.  This is the maths of it from the Government&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>We have been involved in planning this process for each sector for months.  For example, the Minister for Education and Skills laid out his plans in the House months ago and I have repeatedly heard spokespersons from the HSE outlining its detailed plans right down to hospital health care level.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to advance notice.  I sought three months notice from everyone who wanted to avail of it.  People were not required to do so, but many did, which gave us a good idea of most of the numbers leaving so we could account for them.  The Deputy is wrong, as she knows, in regard to incentivised schemes.  This is simply the playing out of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, which came into force in 2010.  That Act provided for a grace period in which people could avail of their pre-cut retirement conditions, in other words, calculate their lump sums and pension rights based on their old salary levels.  The Government is not providing an incentive.  These are people who are approaching retirement and the previous D&aacute;il enacted legislation to allow them to hold on to their pre-cut pensions and lump sums if they retired by a certain deadline.  That deadline has now arrived and we are going to deal with the matter.  They are not being incentivised by design nor are they part of a programme of targeting individual areas.  The next phase of downsizing will certainly be targeted.</P>
        <P>On the specific points raised by the Deputy regarding the Civil Service, the information is on the website.  Local managers in Departments and offices are individually reporting to my Department and they have not signalled difficulties in respect of Civil Service provisions.  It is important that local managers are allowed to manage.  I do not sit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform individually controlling and managing every local office of the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that his workforce planning groups have been in operation for quite some time but when the Taoiseach indicated there was a need to appoint transition teams and drew staff from the planning groups for this purpose, he must not have been satisfied with them.  Will the Minister explain why it was necessary to change the processes applying to the workforce planning groups?</P>
        <P>He used a new phrase when he referred to the next phase of downsizing for the public service.  He might like to elaborate on his comment because we have just completed the volun<Col N="5"/>tary retirement scheme.  He said it will be targeted.  Will he confirm that it will not include a compulsory element?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be news to virtually all the retiring public servants that the incentivised exit mechanism was not in fact an incentive but we will agree to differ on the semantics of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that the objective is to downsize further.  I ask him to explain what he means by that.  I presume he is envisaging something that falls within the parameters of the Croke Park agreement.  He might enlighten us in this regard.  He also says the objective is to act more effectively and efficiently but his record to date has been purely about reducing headcount via an incentivised scheme for people to exit the service early.  Nothing in the master plan or the planning, scant as it is, addresses the question of improving excellence in service provision or efficiency.  The Minister is engaged in a crude cull.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That was more a speech than a question but I will deal with the two points raised.  On Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s questions, the workforce planning teams became transition teams and were augmented&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Same thing, new title.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was the critical final phase when the numbers were clear.  As the Taoiseach rightly felt, we needed an even more proactive engagement and the workforce planning teams that had been established in every sector became transition teams and brought in additional expertise to ensure, as best we could, everything was running smoothly.  We may face problems but I hope we do not because we have done everything that is humanly possible.</P>
        <P>In regard to downsizing, we have set targets for reducing public sector numbers between now and 2015.  It will be done within the umbrella of the Croke Park agreement, which means there will be no compulsory redundancies.</P>
        <P>Deputy McDonald accused me of being fixated with numbers.  I am fixated with two things, namely, restoring the economic sovereignty of our State, which is a job I have been given, and reforming the public service.  That is why we have a Department dedicated to both economic management and political and Civil Service reform.  We will do both and are in the process of doing both.  In the first year we have achieved a remarkable amount.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Clare Daly</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the breadth and timescale of his plans to privatise State assets; if discussions have taken place with the trade unions whose members&rsquo; jobs will be affected; and if he or any other Department have estimated the amount of job losses that will arise from the sale of these assets.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[11409/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My announcement last week contained the details of the breadth and timescale of the Government&rsquo;s plans to dispose of certain non-strategic State assets.  We have agreed with the troika on the sale of assets up to a value of &euro;3 billion based on the guiding principles that there will be no fire sales, integral transmission and distribution systems will be retained in State ownership and full value will be derived for the State.  The assets to be sold will be Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy business, but not including its gas transmission and distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors, which will remain in State ownership; and some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity.  Consideration will also be given to the sale <Col N="6"/>of some assets of Coillte, but not its land holdings, and the sale of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus when market conditions are favourable and an acceptable price can be achieved.</P>
        <P>In the case of the energy State companies, meetings take place between the Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources and union representatives from time to time.  However, no meeting has been held since the Government decision was announced last Thursday.  Job losses are not, as the Deputy&rsquo;s question suggests, an inevitable outcome of this process.  Apart from the receipts from the sale of assets that the Government will retain for reinvestment in the economy, the sale of certain business units of State companies offers the prospect of access to significant new capital to grow these businesses, which might not have otherwise have been available to them, given the current position in capital markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>This question was tabled before the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last week, but I am still none the wiser.  It is regrettable that the announcement was made in the media and not in the House, which would have allowed us to debate some of these issues.  The Minister says he has not spoken to union representatives but the question of job losses is critical.  The Minister has attempted to dress up what is in essence a selling off of valuable State assets in order to pay a debt as something that will somehow create jobs.  That does not add up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How does the Minister intend to achieve what has never been done in the privatisations that have already taken place?  Eircom&rsquo;s workforce has decreased from 14,000 to 7,000 and is targeted to fall to 5,000.  Aer Lingus&rsquo;s workforce has been reduced from 7,500 to 3,500.  How will the Minister accomplish the miracle of a privatisation that does not involve job losses?  Where is this factored in his decisions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the announcement as soon as I could after the Cabinet made its decisions.  I readily agreed to have an early debate in the House.  I very much welcome an open debate on all these matters and I believe one is scheduled for next week.  I entirely agree with the Deputy on learning from the past.  The method of sale of Eircom was not in the public interest because it sold off a strategic asset into the private sector and then it was asset stripped in many ways.  That is why we are not selling off the strategic assets.  We are holding on to the distribution of gas and electricity, and the interconnectors.  That core is important.  However, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann may have, for example, bought a particular wind farm.  While the Deputy might believe that is a strategic asset, I do not.  Some are of the view that everything owned by the State is a strategic asset but that is not how we should operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is dressing this up as a job-creation measure.  However, apart from the job losses which inevitably flow from a privatisation &mdash; there has never been one that did not involve job losses &mdash; how does the Minister answer organisations such as the Woodland League, which would argue that a country such as Switzerland which is half the size of Ireland has twice the area of forest?  While we employ 11,000 in forestry, it employs 120,000 people in that area.  What does the Minister say to the idea that our State assets could be used on valuable indigenous industry job creation programmes that the Minister is forfeiting by his short-term measures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  She is simply wrong on the forestry side.  We have an ambitious forestry programme.  We will be growing more trees.  We are suggesting that we sell off some of the crop.  Trees will grow again and the idea is that one harvests trees and sells them but one keeps the land.  The suggestion is like suggesting to a farmer that he should not sell the crop.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>Deputy Daly referred to downsizing and losing jobs at Aer Lingus.  Every airline has lost jobs during the past decade.  I do not imagine the Deputy is suggesting we should hold on to State companies as employment agencies to keep non-commercial numbers.  The company must operate in the commercial reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>They are outsourced to other private companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has twice mentioned that I am dressing up the pro-jobs issue.  This is a pro-jobs issue.  After long-term negotiations we have changed the view of the troika to allow one third of the total assets to be used to create new jobs.  This is a significant advance in an economy starved of capital for productive purposes.</P>

        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will provide an estimate on a company by company basis of the protocols from the sale of State assets in order that the &euro;3 billion target will be raised; the timetable he envisages for completion of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will understand that I do not propose to indicate to the market how much I expect to raise from the sale of the individual assets in the programme of State asset disposals that I announced.  However, I assure the House that the sales will be transacted via an open, transparent and competitive process.</P>
        <P>On foot of my announcement, work is progressing on plans for the disposals I have outlined.  All of the relevant Departments will participate, overseen by my Department and with the assistance of NewERA entity created by this Government.  The objective is to identify by the end of next month any remaining policy, regulatory, legislative or financial issues that may need to be addressed prior to individual disposals.  Great care will be taken at all times to ensure any decisions are in the national interest and represent good value for the taxpayer.  It is intended that any issues arising will be addressed by the end of this year to facilitate the commencement of sales next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise the Minister has stated in his reply that he cannot give details of the projected sales on a company by company basis.  The Minister claims he cannot put this information in the public arena for commercial sensitivity purposes.  Does the Minister know?  Does he have an estimate on a company by company basis?  Has the Government discussed the estimate on a company by company basis?  Has the Department in conjunction primarily with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources agreed on the basis for it?  Who came up with the estimates on a company by company basis?  The Government cannot have put out a magic figure of &euro;3 billion without knowing approximately where it would come from.</P>
        <P>What professional advisers have worked with the Departments on this matter?  What tendering process took place and when was it advertised?  How much were they paid?  Will these people have an interest in advising potential purchasers later on when they make bids for some of these assets in terms of the methods of sale?  The Minister has given no indication of whether it will be a sale of shares, as happened in other companies, whether it will be a trade sale or whether the Department will invite submissions from interested parties and perhaps invite a limited tender.  Will the Minister explain the process?  Presuming the Minister has professional advisers, has he locked into this process that they must not be in a position to advise any potential purchasers in due course?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The Deputy does not expect me to quantify the value I expect from each item or company we put up for sale.  However, I <Col N="8"/>wish to give as much detail as I can to the Deputy.  Subsequent to the decision made by the Government last September we set up two parallel processes.  The first was to establish what regulatory and other difficulties were presented by the decision made originally on a minority shareholding sale in a vertically integrated ESB.  That process was carried out by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The parallel process involved the valuation of other State companies.  This was carried out by the NewERA entity, drawing on the expertise of the NewERA entity along with the National Treasury Management Agency.  They have put a tentative value on them.  It cannot be all that completely precise until we test the markets.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to a tendering process.  We have not held a tendering process.  Therefore, we do not know the true value.  However, I would expect to get a very good price for the State for the energy component of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE.  The idea, and this is what attracted the troika and helped us in our negotiations, is that this will contribute in two ways to our economic growth.  Not only will we get one third of the proceeds to invest in the productive sector of the economy, but it will also create competition within the energy market, because BGE is the nucleus of an alternative player that will be a competitor for a vertically integrated ESB which will remain a State company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that information.  He has confirmed that he has received no external professional advice with regard to how he came up with the figure of &euro;3 billion, but said it was proposed by the NTMA in NewERA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, in NewERA and they would have had expertise with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps if the Minister is not in a position to provide the information today, he will send the information on to us regarding the level of expertise the particular staff in NewERA have on estimating value of companies where privatisation the selling off of strategic State assets is planned.  The Minister says the sale of Aer Lingus is not the sale of a strategic asset nor is the sale of forestry, but some people would disagree.  Who in the NTMA who was involved in the decision process had experience &mdash; perhaps from another country &mdash; of making these decisions or was it that it was just a group of public servants, which those in the NTMA are, coming up with a figure and presenting that figure to the Minister?  There appears to be no independent verification of any of the figures by anybody outside of officials employed by the Government.  That is not a sufficient basis on which to proceed and I would like to see some verification or benchmark as to whether this is a realistic figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is quite disparaging of the qualities available to the NTMA.  Based on the amount of money we are paying those working in the NTMA, I sincerely hope they are not run of the mill civil servants.  They are individuals who are highly qualified for treasury management, to run our national debt process and to involve themselves in a range of the strategic funding issues that affect the State and they are well placed to look at these matters and get expert advice on them.  I am confident of that.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked how we determined what was strategic.  The NTMA did not do that, the Government did and that is laid out in the plans we have made.  The Deputy asked who decided Aer Lingus was not a strategic asset.  The problem is the Deputy&rsquo;s party sold off 75% of Aer Lingus.  The remaining 25% is not a strategic holding.  We do not have any leverage on the slots in Heathrow or anything else.  Fianna F&aacute;il sold that, unfortunately.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will provide a full list of all payments and allowances paid to members of the Government; the changes, if any, he plans to make to these payments and allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[11411/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government decided on taking office in March 2011 to reduce the salaries of An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers with immediate effect.  The reductions were implemented on a voluntary basis pending the passage of the necessary legislation giving statutory effect to the reductions.  Section 6(c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 provides the legislative basis for the pay reductions from 1 January 2012. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The gross annual salaries now applicable to An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers amount to &euro;200,000, &euro;184,405 and &euro;169,275, respectively.  The gross salaries indicated are inclusive of the pay element for a Deputy amounting to &euro;92,672.  The effect of these reductions is that the gross annual salary of An Taoiseach has been reduced by nearly 30% since December 2009, and that of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers by nearly 25% over the same period.</P>
        <P>Since 1 May 2011, Cabinet Ministers with the exception of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality now use their own cars on official business.  All Ministers are now paid for official mileage up to 96,540 kilometres or 60,000 miles per annum.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on the same basis since 1984.  Ministers, including Ministers of State, may appoint two civilian drivers, the salaries for whom are paid by the Minister&rsquo;s respective Department.  At the time the change was made, it was estimated the savings to be achieved by Cabinet Ministers using their cars would be approximately &euro;4 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>Ministers do not receive overnight payments while in Dublin.  Ministers on overnight business away from their home or headquarters may claim the vouched cost of a hotel room, including tax and up to 15% in respect of any service charge.  They may also claim an overnight subsistence allowance of &euro;72.66 which is half the civil service Class A overnight rate of &euro;108.99, increased by one third.  Slightly higher rates apply in the case of travel to the USA and Canada.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>As with all Members of the Oireachtas, Ministers may receive the public representation allowance element of the parliamentary standard allowance.  Under the public representational allowance, Ministers may claim an unvouched amount of &euro;12,000 per annum or a fully vouched amount up to &euro;20,000 per annum.  The purposes for which this allowance may be used includes expenses related to constituency offices, home telephones, newspaper advertising, distribution of leaflets, newsletters, conferences and other matters related to their duties as a public representative.  From 1 February, additional secretarial support as well as public relations, certain information technology and training services are included within the scope of this allowance.  The overall cap remains unchanged.  Since the commencement of the parliamentary standard allowance, Ministers&rsquo; Departments are responsible for paying the cost of telephones in Ministers&rsquo; constituency offices.</P>
        <P>While it is not possible for me orally to go through a full list of the headings under which costs incurred are recouped by Ministers, I am arranging for the material to be made available to the Deputy directly.  The Government has introduced a range of changes to the regime of payments and allowances paid to Government Ministers which has resulted in significant finan<Col N="10"/>cial savings to the Exchequer.  It is my intention to continue to ensure that the greatest value for money can be achieved in relation to payments and expenses of this nature on an ongoing basis consistent with ensuring maximum efficiency and output from officeholders and their offices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister had my full attention.  I am sorry that he was cut short.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a rule of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  I was introducing a note of levity, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I would like to focus on one or two specific matters.  What, if anything, does the Minister propose to do about the laundry tax deduction allowance of &euro;3,500 that is available to Ministers from outside Dublin who stay in hotels?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister comment on the dual abode allowance, which is offered to Ministers who maintain second residences in addition to their primary residences and who represent constituencies outside Dublin?  The allowance makes it possible for such Ministers to make a claim to the Revenue Commissioners for a tax deduction which can amount to &euro;6,500 per annum.  Such expenses and perks cannot be justified at any time and are particularly unjustifiable in the current climate.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the issue of mileage and the use by Ministers of their own cars.  Can I ask him to address the recent controversy involving his colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn?  The controversy suggested that there is some difficulty in measuring the number of kilometres covered by Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to respond to the three specific points that have rightly been made by the Deputy.  I will not bring in extraneous matters or claim other things.  I heard about the laundry issue on the radio.  I had never heard of it before then.  Nobody in the Cabinet had ever heard of it.  I cannot find anybody who has ever claimed it, or even heard of it.  I have no idea where it came from.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it exist?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, as far as I am aware.  It is not on any list that I have.  I have no idea where it came from.  The day it came up, I specifically asked whether anybody had ever claimed it, or heard of it.  Nobody in the Cabinet of this Government had heard of it or claimed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>So it does not exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am concerned, it does not exist.  It is one of these interesting things that make for a good headline.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the dual abode allowance.  Her colleagues who come from outside Dublin claim an overnight allowance.  Ministers are not entitled to that.  When our colleagues who are Ministers and Ministers of State come to Leinster House they pay their hotel bills out of their own salaries.  There is a dual abode allowance for those who actually have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no longer an overnight allowance for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="11"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not go there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should correct what he has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an overnight allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is factored into the allowances that are paid.  That is why there is a requirement to be in attendance for a fixed number of days each year.  It is understood as being factored in.  No such allowance is available to members of the Government.  A dual abode allowance, which is a tax concession, is available to Ministers.  I assure the House that it does not come close to covering the cost of staying overnight.  I am willing to debate this matter because it needs to be addressed in a much fairer way.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s final question related to mileage.  When we came into office, we said we would abolish State cars, etc.  In the last D&aacute;il, the cost of State cars was &euro;280,000 per annum per Minister.  The cost of the new regime we have introduced is less than &euro;100,000 per annum per Minister.  We have reduced it by more than 60%, which is a very credible performance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>My question on that final point related to the measurement of the travel in question, which was the source of the controversy.  The Minister might come back to that.  It is curious that the Minister has said he had not heard of this laundry allowance.  His colleagues were similarly unenlightened.  It does exist.  I strongly suggest that it should be abolished forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can consider it abolished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think a long review is needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I had never heard of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been cited in response to parliamentary questions.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that point.</P>
        <P>The Minister dodged the question on the dual abode allowance by referring to overnight rates.  This allowance allows for a Revenue write-off in respect of a percentage of the interest paid on the purchase of a second property or vouched elements in respect of the maintenance and so on, of a second property.  There is a world of difference between public moneys legitimately covering accommodation in a hotel or a bed and breakfast or whatever, as against public moneys being a contribution to the purchase of a second residence or, for that matter, the maintenance and upkeep of that second residence.  I put it to the Minister once more that this dual abode allowance is yet another of those that should be abolished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that in my own case, the dual abode allowance does not cover a fraction of the cost of my accommodation in Dublin.  I am not complaining about this fact.  If I were entitled to claim as a Deputy I would be able to cover the costs.  I would be very happy to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister could swap places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;take the Deputy&rsquo;s allowance instead.  I will happily abolish the dual abode allowance.</P><Col N="12"/>
        <P>With regard to the issue of laundry as raised by the Deputy, I cannot find the reference but if the Deputy can provide me with same, I would like to hear it or see it.  I suggest she sends me the details.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>Following my announcement of the programme of State asset disposals last week, work is progressing on plans for the disposals.  All of the relevant Departments will participate, overseen by my Department and with the assistance of NewERA.  The objective is to identify by the end of March any remaining policy, regulatory, legislative and-or financial issues that may need to be addressed prior to disposal.  Great care will be taken at all times to ensure any decisions are in the national interest and represent value for the Exchequer.  It is intended that any issues arising will be addressed by the end of 2012 in order to facilitate transactions commencing in 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to Question No. 82.  I asked how the Minister intends to proceed with regard to the sale of State assets.  Has he an open mind with regard to the public placing of shares, the placement of shares with certain financial institutions, an invitation to expressions of interest and the sale of assets to the known businesses in the trade?  Has he asked the NTMA to draw up a list of power companies who will be invited to bid?  I understand a number of sharks are out there &mdash; the term used by Bord G&aacute;is Energy &mdash; who want to take over that business.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to explain the process for the sale of the assets.  I do not mean to say I agree with a selling process but I wish to hear the Minister&rsquo;s intentions as to the process he intends to follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed analytical work commenced immediately following the Government decision with regard to Bord G&aacute;is Energy, the ESB and the Coillte proposal, which is being considered.  The process will examine the regulatory and legislative difficulties, the best placement procedures and how to obtain best value.  These matters are currently under consideration.  I am required by the Government decision to revert to the Government by the end of March to address those issues and to set out how we intend to proceed.</P>
        <P>As for the other decision, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is looking at those generating assets within the ESB which are non-strategic and which can also be available for sale.  The idea is to sell Bord G&aacute;is Energy with some ESB power generating in a bundle or sell some of the generating capacity of the ESB separately in order to have a significant nucleus of energy generating capacity that would be competitive and offer best value <Col N="13"/>to ensure that the cost of energy is as competitive as possible.  There is a double value.  First, we will try to get a maximum price and, second, we want to get a strategic change so we will have real dynamic competition within the energy sector in the interests of business and the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the people in NewERA and the NTMA factoring in the issue of pension fund deficits in these organisations and whether there will be an employee share option scheme, as happened in some previous privatisations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Fleming is probably aware, there is an ESOP scheme already in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  A little over 3% of the company is owned by the employees and that will be part of the things which will be addressed now because, as Deputy Fleming knows, the company is well on the way to being disaggregated into the transmission and the generating elements of it.  The transmission elements of it, including the gas interconnectors and so on, will remain in State ownership.  What is proposed to be sold is the generating capacity of it, which is not strategic.  If we can have a significant new player in the Irish market, it will be in the interests of the consumers and industry generally.  The other point Deputy Fleming made about pension funds and deficits is a factor which is being taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of both the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the workforce holds shares so, with that in mind, I was curious to hear the Minister had not spoken to the trade unions.  He might do that with some urgency because the employees will have a view on all of this.</P>
        <P>The Minister repeatedly made a claim today that the sell-off of these assets is somehow a pathway to enhanced competitiveness and reduced prices.  I am sure he is as aware as I am that the history of deregulation of the energy sector in this small island has never resulted in a dip in prices.  In fact, we moved rather spectacularly from having very low energy prices to now having among the highest across Europe.  It probably makes a good sound bite for the Minister in selling this fire sale but I do not think it is an argument he can substantiate.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he will raise &euro;3 billion.  Notwithstanding giving us figures down to the cent, he must have some sense of the individual value of these assets.  I put it to him that there is a reason these assets are attractive to put on the market and bidders will be interested in them.  It is because they generate very significant revenue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very hard to take lectures about sound bites from Deputy McDonald.  She is the master.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that as it is intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I say that as a compliment.  She used four sound bites in the question, including representing it all as a fire sale when not only the decision but the memorandum of understanding with the troika makes it crystal clear there will not be a fire sale.  If we do not get a fair price for these, we will not sell them.  It is as simple as that, so that will ensure there will not be.</P>
        <P>I refer to the other point Deputy McDonald made and all these things one cannot let go, because she throws these things in as almost the truth, and this is the notion that this is deregulation.  It is anything but deregulation of the energy market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="14"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to achieve real and better competition in the energy market.</P>
        <P>I refer to the notion that it is somehow a bad thing to get a good price for them and that we will get a good price for them because they are valuable assets.  Of course, we want to get the best price because we need to pay down some of the State&rsquo;s debt.  That is not a bad thing of itself, that is, to take some of the terrible burden of debt off the Irish taxpayer.  We  also want to get some access to money to invest in the productive economy.  We have got a very good deal where one third of the total asset sales can be used for that purpose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister told us there will not be a fire sale.  He said he will get full value for the State.  Would he agree that is not likely to happen in the next two or three years given that the price of everything has gone so low?  It beggars belief for him to think he can get real value for this in the next two or three years.  Will there be a detailed cost benefit analysis to weigh selling State assets against the long-term costs to the economy, society and the environment?  That would be interesting.</P>
        <P>The Minister said there is no great strategic value to the State&rsquo;s holding of 25% but we must remember that the staff hold 15% and, combined, at 40% it is the largest stake by far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The question asked about the criteria used by the Minister in proceeding with the sell-off.  Why did he think it unnecessary to examine fully each State asset in terms of the social, economic and environmental value?  I refer in particular to public forests, which could be managed in a way that is of enormous benefit to citizens in this country.  I ask the Minister to comment on why we have 11,000 people employed in forestry when a country half our size, Switzerland, has 120,000 people employed in forestry.  Why is he not analysing our State assets in this way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is worthy of a long debate and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine would be delighted to have it.  The percentage of land under forest in Switzerland is of a different magnitude to the percentage under forest in Ireland, if the Deputy had not noticed.  We need more forestry and this Government has given clear attention to it in the programme for Government.  Managing forests means harvesting the crop in the public interest.  There is a difference in the decision.  We will consider the Coillte proposal because other proposals have been made for the use of the forest.  The Minister is examining these and we will make the best strategic decision for the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The questions of Deputy Wallace are like saying that we should ignore the current economic crisis.  We must map our way out of it with every tool available.  It has long been said that austerity alone is not a strategy, a criticism with which I agree.  It must be part of the strategy because the only people who will give us money have attached conditions to the money.  That is why we must achieve the deficit reduction target.  There is no gainsaying that and anyone who understands economics understands that.  We must also have a growth strategy and utilising some of the assets to invest in the productive economy is part of that strategy.  There are other elements, such as the development of the NewERA entity and the strategic investment fund, to which we have committed &euro;250 million from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  We will leverage that to &euro;1 billion for investment in job creation and we also want to use the residual part of the NPRF.  I had a discussion on the use of other pension funds.  We want to release that because of the &euro;70 billion in pension funds, only 2% is used in the productive economy.  There will be a range of initiatives to leverage further investment for a growth strategy to mirror the strategy of balancing books.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the steps he is taking to address the summer flooding in the Shannon callows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[10587/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy has, on a regular basis, raised the matter of management of the River Shannon catchment, which includes the Shannon callows area and that extensive responses have been provided.  The information I am happy to provide remains much the same as that provided previously.  In addition, a full corpus of updated information on both the national and Shannon catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programmes is available on the respective websites.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the assessment and management of flood risk on the Shannon catchment comes within the CFRAM programme, the national programme covering all national river catchments.  The national programme represents a major investment of several tens of millions of euro by the State in a comprehensive study of flood risk, which will produce robust, evidence-based and extensive management plans to drive the management of flood risk across the country.  This is a comprehensive undertaking and a significant part of the OPW&rsquo;s resources are being dedicated to ensuring its completion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the scale and nature of the programme over a four year lifecycle, up to the end of 2015, the Deputy will appreciate that clear direction as to improvements in the management of the River Shannon catchment and mitigation of localised flooding risk in areas like the callows will not emerge until the programme has reached its conclusion.  The Government is determined to ensure that a comprehensive CFRAM programme will form the core of a properly informed and managed approach to addressing areas of flood risk in the coming decades.  This approach will allow us to go beyond the reactive deployment of resources where OPW generally intervenes with capital works projects after significant flood events to a more anticipatory stance whereby evidence-based and prioritised interventions can be programmed in advance of and in prevention of future flood events.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The implementation body established under the public service agreement 2010-14 is charged with driving the implementation of the agreement to maximum effect.  The body also undertakes an annual review of the sustainable savings generated from the implementation of the agreement.  The first review by the implementation body was published in June 2011. </P>
        <P>The implementation body has no role in the review of pay rates in the public service, which is a matter reserved to me as Minister, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, as amended.  That Act, which imposed a progressive pay reduction on all public servants ranging from 5% to 30% with effect from 1 January 2010, provided that before 30 June 2011 and every year after that the Minister shall carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the Act and lay a written report of the findings resulting <Col N="16"/>from the review before each House of the Oireachtas.  In the public service agreement, the Government agreed that the statutory review under the Act would take account of the sustainable savings generated from the implementation of the agreement.  In the event of sufficient savings being identified in the 2011 review by the implementation body, it was agreed that priority would be given in any review of pay to public servants with annual pay rates of &euro;35,000 or less.</P>
        <P>In line with the requirements under the 2009 Act, I completed a review of its operation in June 2011.  The report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 June 2011 and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The report concluded that, having regard to the overall economic conditions, national competitiveness and Exchequer commitments in respect of public service pay, the measures put in place by the Act continue to be required.  This remains the position pending a further statutory review of the Act in June next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if the answer to the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  My question was to review very high pay in the public sector.  I had in mind the 7,000 people who earn in excess of &euro;100,000.  In the same context, it is useful to note that 10% of families in receipt of family income supplement, the lowest paid workers in the State, are public sector workers.  The Minister has identified a mechanism by which such review of very high pay could be undertaken.  Will the Minister give us a clear &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer on the review?</P>
        <P>In response to an earlier question, the Minister set out the extravagant levels of pay of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers.  Those payments cannot be justified.  A small section of workers, some 7,000 in the public sector, are vastly overpaid.  Will the Minister review that matter and correct it under emergency legislation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it clear that this is the first Government ever to take serious proactive action to deal with hope in the public service.  We reduced pay by between 5% and 30%.  A 30% reduction was taken by the Taoiseach.  That should be acknowledged.  I also placed a pay ceiling on the public service so that no one in the Civil Service or public service should be paid more than &euro;200,000.  That has been largely implemented except where contractual obligations precluded us from implementing it.  In those cases, I sought a voluntary reduction.  In the semi-State sector, we introduced a ceiling of &euro;250,000 and when considering that multiples of that sum were paid up to last year, the Deputy should acknowledge the remarkable achievements of the Government in reducing public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I take it the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No matter how far we go, it is never enough for Deputy McDonald.  We must ensure that we have quality people in the public service and a variety of skills.  The Deputy has no doubt read the Nyberg report on the operation of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>One of the deficiencies identified was that there were not enough experts and economists to operate a very complicated banking system.  The Government and I are very pro-public service and want people of the highest calibre available.  We do not want to pay rates to buy in from the private sector the skills the Government requires.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 10% of them are on family income supplement.  The Minister is protecting people on outrageous salaries.  The answer is clearly &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I assumed Other Questions was finished.  I can only read from the response of the Minister that he is quite happy for a significant number of public servants to be so poorly paid that the State has to supplement their income with family income supplement, while giving us codswallop about expertise and skills to explain salaries he knows no sane person could justify.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy at least to acknowledge what we have done to date.  For the first time we have put in a ceiling of &euro;200,000.  The Taoiseach is receiving 30% less in pay than his predecessor.  We have reformed the expenses and car transport systems and introduced new pay ceilings across the public service of &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000.</P>
        <P>The pressure will be whether in the commercial semi-State sector we will get people of sufficient calibre to run the very companies we have been asking questions about.  They will be important in driving our economic development.  In terms of ensuring we have people of the highest calibre and ability working in the public sector, the Government will ensure that arrives.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made a valid point on ensuring that everybody is paid a fair wage in this economy.  That is why one of the first things we did was to restore the minimum wage, something the Deputy said was impossible.  It was achieved in the first couple of months of this Government.  As our economy recovers, we will try to ensure everybody has a projection of increased income.  I hope we can do that on the basis of fairness to shrink the gap between those earning most and those earning least in our economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will make an announcement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be an opportunity to respond?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform the House that the Irish people will be asked for their authorisation, in a referendum, to ratify the European stability treaty, the so-called fiscal compact treaty.  I strongly believe it is very much in Ireland&rsquo;s national interest that this treaty be approved, as doing so will build on the steady progress the country has made in the past 12 months.  That progress has seen international and investor confidence in Ireland rising, leading to many new investments in our country, investments that are creating new jobs for our people.  I want that flow of investment to continue and expand.</P>
        <P>Ratification of this treaty will be another important step in the rebuilding of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and our international reputation.  It will give the Irish people the opportunity to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to membership of the euro, which remains a fundamental pillar of our economic and jobs strategy.  More binding and enforceable fiscal rules as a result of ratification will be good for Ireland and the wider eurozone, and will cement growing international confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.</P>
        <P>Long before any discussions of a new set of housekeeping rules for the eurozone, the new Government had committed itself to legislate for equally challenging domestic deficit and debt rules.  In this referendum, the Irish people can confirm our commitment to responsible budgeting and, in doing so, ensure that the reckless economic mismanagement that drove our country to the brink of bankruptcy will not be repeated by any future Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="18"/>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Putting in place this credible commitment to responsible budgeting will be key to keeping interest rates low and unlocking credit availability for investment and job creation.  Lower interest rates also mean more resources for the provision of essential public services.  The creation of stronger budgetary rules is an essential element of the steps that are needed to ensure stability, confidence and growth here in Ireland and in the eurozone.</P>
        <P>Throughout the process leading to this new treaty, the Government has consistently said that the final text would be referred to the Attorney General for her advice as to whether a referendum was required to ratify it in Ireland.  At this morning&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting, the Attorney General conveyed her formal advice that, as this treaty is a unique instrument, outside the European Union treaty architecture, on balance, a referendum is required to ratify it.</P>
        <P>On foot of this advice, the Government has decided to hold a referendum on this issue in which the people of Ireland will be asked to give their authorisation for the ratification of this treaty.  On Friday, along with other heads of government, I intend to sign this treaty in Brussels.  In the coming weeks, the Government will finalise the arrangements and process leading to this referendum, including the establishment of a referendum commission to ensure adequate and full public information, a referendum Bill which will be debated in the Oireachtas and draft legislation to provide for the implementation of the treaty&rsquo;s provisions will be published.</P>
        <P>I am very confident that when the importance and merits of this treaty are communicated to the Irish people, they will endorse it emphatically by voting Yes to continued economic stability and recovery.  I look forward to that debate, one which I believe will produce a result that will be seen in the future as an historic milestone in Ireland&rsquo;s economic comeback and keep Ireland central to the European process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Today the Attorney General has advised the Government that it is best for Ireland to have a referendum in order to ratify the European stability treaty.  On foot of that advice, and in line with our public commitment, the Government has decided to consult the people by referendum and seek approval for the treaty.  In the weeks ahead there will be ample opportunity for debating the detail of the treaty provisions.  In the end, this will come down to a vote for economic stability and economic recovery.</P>
        <P>When this Government was elected a year ago Ireland was in the depths of a political, economic and financial crisis.  In the past 12 months the situation has been transformed through the hard work and sacrifice of the Irish people.  We have re-established financial and political stability and are working all-out to achieve economic recovery.  It has been a difficult path for all of us but as a country we have made important progress.</P>
        <P>Our cost of borrowing has fallen, we have substantially re-negotiated the EU-IMF programme, our reputation internationally has been transformed and money and jobs are coming back into the country.  Once again we are seeing international companies investing and creating jobs in Ireland.  Just yesterday we saw the benefits of the renewed confidence in the country being translated into 200 more jobs in Cork, which in turn followed from an announcement of 1,000 jobs in Dundalk.  These announcements were made possible by the turnaround that has been achieved in Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and a renewed sense of financial and economic stability.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a small and extremely open economy.  Our living standards and capacity to create jobs depends on our ability to trade and attract investment.  For that to happen and for economic recovery to be possible, we need stability in Ireland and in Europe, the kind of stability that gives investors and families reasonable certainty about what the future holds.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>Until we achieve that certainty at home and in Europe, confidence will not fully return to the domestic Irish economy and our recovery will be delayed.  We need a thriving and prosperous European economy that has moved beyond the current crisis.  That is the purpose of this treaty.  It is part of a package of measures being put in place in Europe to stabilise the situation in the eurozone.  As I have said, that is vital to our national interests.</P>
        <P>The treaty is an important part of that package because it provides assurance that the kinds of problems that have emerged in Greece cannot happen again.  Ratifying the treaty will also provide Ireland with access to emergency funds in the future, if we need them, through the new European stability mechanism.  Our intention is to emerge from the EU-IMF programme without having to resort to the ESM, but the facility is an important backstop that will further enhance international confidence in Ireland.</P>
        <P>After years of crisis and sacrifice the Irish people now have the basis on which to build a sustainable economic recovery.  We now have an opportunity to go beyond the casino capitalism that brought us to this point and build sustainable prosperity based on our capacity to sell goods and services abroad, attract investment and rebuild confidence in the domestic economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>It comes down to what is best to attract investment to Ireland in order to create the jobs we need, what will make existing jobs more secure and what will help a young couple to have confidence to buy a house, a person who has an idea and the necessary drive to start a business and families to plan and save for their children&rsquo;s future.</P>
        <P>As I stated last December, if we must have another referendum in this country, so be it.  If that is what we must do to save our currency and restore our economy to be able, as a sovereign nation, to borrow again on the financial markets and ensure that no future Government can ever again bring us to such a sorry state, I am confident the Irish will do what is necessary.  Endorsing the treaty will be another important milestone for Ireland in our road to recovery.  In the weeks ahead, as the Government puts in place the necessary measures for a referendum, that is the case we will make to the people. I am confident they will respond by saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the treaty.</P>

	<P>I believed the Deputy wanted a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision.  It is the right one and it should not have required a legal opinion.  It is a very important treaty and the people have a right to decide.  I asked over two weeks ago at the Institute of International and European Affairs how we could honestly expect people to be happy if they are told a treaty is important enough to save the euro but not important enough for them to have a say.  I warmly welcome the referendum.  I have argued consistently, particularly arising from my experiences of the second Lisbon treaty referendum and directing the campaign, that the people need to be engaged.  We need to take the people with us on our journey in respect of the European Union, not just on the treaty under discussion.</P>
        <P>I respectfully suggest to the Government side that it may very well need the support of quite a number of us on this side to have the treaty passed and that there should be less of the partisan commentary.  This would be appropriate given the gravity of the issues before us.  The crucial issue, based on experience of the Lisbon treaty, is the necessity to engage with people on this issue.  I am clear where my party and I stand; we will be supporting the ratification of the treaty.  We welcome the fact that it is going before the people.  We predict another treaty down the line that will have to be put to the people given the issues that have yet to be grasped by our European leadership.</P>
        <P>We have been very critical of the manner in which the Government has engaged with the D&aacute;il on this issue over the past six to nine months.  I asked that a sub-committee of the D&aacute;il be established to deal with the lead-up to the treaty negotiations so Members would have an opportunity to inform themselves of the detail of the treaty, the issues to be discussed.  Regrettably, that did not happen.  Before Christmas, I asked for meetings with the Taoiseach to discuss the Government&rsquo;s position in advance of the summit before Christmas, again so the Opposition would be apprised of the issues covered by the treaty and the negotiating stance of the Government.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that, unfortunately, we cannot approach Europe or every European treaty on the basis that we are scared about what may emerge or have to be put to the people, or that we want to do everything possible to prevent a referendum, as a German Minister stated here last week when he confirmed a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Arthur Beesley that every <Col N="21"/>effort was made to avoid a constitutional change.  That is regrettable and is not the way to approach these issues.</P>
        <P>It is very clear that this treaty is very important to Ireland&rsquo;s economic future and also to the broader circumstances across Europe.  We have said the treaty is reasonable but it is not, by any means, the answer to the eurozone crisis.  Far more substantive issues must be dealt with, such as broadening the mandate of the European Central Bank and developing a broader fiscal union involving genuine transfers from stronger states to others, if we are to maintain equilibrium in our monetary union.  We must learn the lessons from the flawed design of the euro, which have come to pass in what has been labelled as &ldquo;the great recession&rdquo;, the worst in 80 years.  We must take all that on board, and the only way we can do so is through more fundamental change.  That said, this is a reasonable treaty.  I accept what the T&aacute;naiste is saying about access to the ESM and the content of an appendix to a treaty.</P>
        <P>In essence, if we want to get back into the marketplace we want the ESM as a backstop to ensure we can keep our education and welfare systems running along with the various other services provided through current expenditure.  We will support the ratification of the treaty and will be proposing a series of additional measures for the legislation that appears before us.  The referendum will only pass if we present it to the people as part of a series of measures required to return Europe to jobs and growth.  It cannot be presented as the only major reform on the agenda.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&aacute;iteas seo.  T&aacute;im an-s&aacute;sta gur th&aacute;inig an Taoiseach agus an T&aacute;naiste go dt&iacute; an D&aacute;il agus go ndearna siad an r&aacute;iteas anseo.  Is maith an rud &eacute; sin.  T&aacute;im ag &eacute;ir&iacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n d&oacute;chasach go mb&iacute;onn siad ag &eacute;isteacht liomsa agus le Sinn F&eacute;in uaireanta. Ar an &aacute;bhar sin, I welcome the announcement and the fact that the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have come to the Chamber to make it.  That is unusual but it gives us hope that the Government occasionally listens to Sinn F&eacute;in on these matters.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the announcement, I believe it marks another failure by the Government.  It tried to avoid a referendum, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged, but it is good that there will now be one because the people will now have a say.  Since the first drafts of the treaty were leaked to the public &mdash; last December, I believe &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in has argued there is a democratic imperative to have a referendum.  I am glad there is a clear legal case.  The value of a referendum is primarily that the people will have their say on a matter of profound and long-lasting importance.</P>
        <P>The question is whether the Government will accept the outcome.  Are we to have the usual rerun or replay?  Will the Government phrase the question in such a way as to allow the people to have an informed debate as opposed to being subject to the bullying tactics used in the past?  If the Government has identified the phrasing, will it remind me of what it is?  It is equally important that the campaign be informed and informative and that the details of the treaty and its implications for the people of this State and the island be discussed fully and debated.</P>
        <P>We welcome the announcement.  Let us be clear, however, that the treaty is an austerity treaty that will not help to regenerate the economy.  On the contrary, it will condemn the people, particularly those on lower and middle incomes, to endure the Government&rsquo;s terrible policy of austerity.  It is little wonder that Fianna F&aacute;il supports this.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and Fine Gael formed a consensus for cuts and we will see that replayed again.  The Taoiseach has declared he wants to be able to take economic power back into this State &mdash; that is, whatever little economic power remains &mdash; yet here he is in a treaty taking what limited fiscal power is in the Oireachtas and giving it to unelected, undemocratic officials in Brussels.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>Let us have a good, informed debate.  Let us also ensure that the citizenry who have now had their rights restored to them &mdash; something which this Government tried to avoid &mdash; will be able to take a decision which binds the Government so it cannot ignore their wishes.  Sinn F&eacute;in is clearly against this treaty from what we have heard of it.  We wait to see the question that will be put.  We are against austerity and do not think it is fair, right or proper that working people should have to pay the penalty of bad Government, or that this has to happen in order to pay off the Government&rsquo;s cronies in the ciorcal &oacute;rga &mdash; the big bankers, bondholders and all the rest.</P>

When the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s predecessors were in the Chair, whenever issues like this arose, it was recognised that for certain purposes parties in opposition &mdash; under Standing Orders, this means parties of two Deputies or more &mdash; are also given the right to make a short intervention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no precedent for this.  In fact, I have taken it upon myself to create a precedent, given the seriousness of the situation, to allow spokespersons from the three groups.  I was told that the Technical Group has nominated Deputy Shane Ross.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is correct.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Technical Group, all of it, I wish to welcome the fact that we are having a referendum on this treaty.  I only regret that it was not called without having to go to the Attorney General.  What happened in this case was that the Government was against holding a referendum, as enunciated by the Minister for Transport earlier, because it would apparently involve a lot of extraneous issues and it would be difficult to have a referendum on this issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome this because it gives us and the people an opportunity to debate wider issues than just this one, which will come into it.  It is a pity that the Government did not, first of all, voluntarily go down this road.  When it came into power it should also have held a referendum on the EU-IMF deal.</P>

	<P>That will be part of this debate whether the Government likes it or not.  What will arise in this debate will be the promissory notes and the debt.  Those two issues will be the most important ones.  Government Ministers will have to face the fact that the people did not like that initial deal and, as a result, they will not particularly like this deal either.  This deal is an extension of the last one.</P>

	<P>As Deputy Adams said, this is a fiscal union pact on austerity.  It is a pact which has not been a product of Irish input, but one that is dictated by Germans, French and others.  It is a realistic reflection of where power lies in Europe.  Let there be no doubt whatsoever that this is not an end in itself.  In this pact we will see the forerunner of further fiscal union down the road, which we will not like and will not accept.  It would be utterly wrong for anyone here to think that this is some sort of an isolated treaty.  After this will come tighter fiscal union, greater sacrifice of our independence and further attempts to increase our corporation profits tax.  This is a road which we should not wish to go down.  The Government should ask the people to pass this, but promise them that if they do so the debt will be reduced.</P>

        <P>To return to domestic matters, I know we are at the first anniversary of the Government and so forth, but last week I was in the north west and met many people there.  I was struck that, a year after the general election, people were still talking about broken promises that were made in respect of that area.  The Taoiseach may recall that during the election campaign the Labour Party promised that Sligo would become the ninth centre of excellence, while Fine Gael promised to return cancer services, which had been removed, to Galway.  The current Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, went so far as to promise it within the first 100 days of office and said he would resign from Fine Gael if that did not happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Donegal, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, visited Lifford and &mdash; as he did in many areas across the country at that time &mdash; gave categorical assurances that the 20-bed unit would &ldquo;under no circumstances be closed&rdquo;.  He said its proximity to the Border was one of the main reasons.</P>
        <P>Even though HIQA&rsquo;s report stated Lifford provides excellent care, the Government is announcing, one year on, that Lifford is to be closed along with approximately another 800 community nursing beds across the country.  Both Fine Gael and Labour promised more home care packages with additional funding to community care.  Fine Gael went further to state home care packages would be applied fairly and consistently across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>One year later, 1,000 people will have their home helps removed.  People across the north west are angry and annoyed at the fact there has been no attempt at all to fulfil the commitments that were solemnly given by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party and his partners in Government, the Labour Party, to establish the ninth centre of excellence for cancer care in the north west.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if this commitment and that made on Lifford hospital will be fulfilled?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="25"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I meet people from the north west regularly.  They are consistent on a strong programme of issues that should be addressed in the north west which have been neglected for many years.  Both parties in Government have particular views about several locations around the country.  The programme for Government is very clear about the introduction of universal health insurance at the end of the Government&rsquo;s term of office, the provision of primary care centres and teams, the development of strong community care protection and the provision of special facilities in particular locations.  The Government is working on this programme.</P>
        <P>The question of the provision of adequate health facilities in every hospital is always under consideration.  The relevant medical teams which are looking at the future role of and the expansion of services in smaller local hospitals are in the process of completing their review.  The future of those particular groupings of hospitals will be a matter for public consultation.</P>
        <P>The review of the groupings of larger hospitals with smaller ones is also under way by the medical and clinical teams.  When that is finalised, it will become a matter for public discussion and a decision by the Government.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin&rsquo;s question about the long programme of issues in the north west is one with which I am intimately acquainted.  One can go to many other places and hear equally strong views about issues too.  Suffice it to say, the Government&rsquo;s intention is to implement its programme for Government regarding health services.  It is a challenging way forward in changing the structure and decision process that will lead to best care and attention for patients which should be central to every health programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a long list.  I suggest the term &ldquo;intimate acquaintance&rdquo; is the wrong one for the definition of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s relationship with the issues in Donegal.  It is getting hostile in terms of people&rsquo;s sense of grievance about a breach of promise.  It is specifically around cancer care and the commitments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, the T&aacute;naiste and the Fine Gael Party to establish a centre of excellence in cancer care in the north west.  There was a solemn commitment given.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to uphold that promise?  Will the Government establish a centre of excellence in cancer care in the north west?  Yes or no?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health was in the north west for the past two days.  He met with a range of personnel from the medical profession from a number of centres in the region.  As I said, the Government is intent in implementing its programme for Government.  The programme is clear in the sectors I have already outlined for Deputy Martin.</P>
        <P>The Government is now having the response from the clinical and medical teams with full co-operation and flexibility as it makes arrangements to deal with the transition of a significant number of persons who are leaving the health service as a result of the new pension arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach did not answer my straightforward question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Next week, the Government will be in office for a year.  Before the last election, Fine Gael rightly railed against what it described as &ldquo;professional advisers, <Col N="26"/>accountants, lawyers [and] other consultants linked [with the] National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the bailed-out banks, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach and Fine Gael correctly identified an obvious conflict of interest then.  One year later, however, this network remains in place.  Indeed, many of the senior figures in NAMA were also senior members of the banking, financial and property sectors which caused the crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An aonta&iacute;onn an Taoiseach liom go bhfuil coimhlint leasa aige i dtaobh na ruda&iacute; seo ar fad?  C&aacute; bhfuil an tr&eacute;dhearcacht ar sheas s&eacute; leis chomh l&aacute;idir sin i rith an tochgh&aacute;in.  Bh&iacute;odh s&eacute; ag tabhairt amach ansin, ach anois is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an ciorcal &oacute;rga f&oacute;s faoi chosaint aige.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag cosaint na saibhir in ionad na boicht.</P>
        <P>Some 16 firms were selected by the agency to advise it on loan sales in Europe and the USA.  NAMA has confirmed to me that some of its senior management have links with these 16 firms.  Does the Taoiseach believe there is sufficient transparency to avoid conflicts of interest in the sale of these assets which he identified?  We are talking about billions of euro worth of assets that are being sold by NAMA.  The D&aacute;il and the public deserve to know how much taxpayers&rsquo; money NAMA has paid for the properties it controls.  A year ago, the Taoiseach promised transparency and that &ldquo;details of all non-performing loans acquired by NAMA will be available for scrutiny on a public register, including the names of the creditors, the price paid by the taxpayer for the loans and the actions taken by NAMA to recover the loans&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Taoiseach not delivered on this promise?  Why does NAMA remain cloaked in secrecy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; a fhios agam go maith c&eacute;ard at&aacute; an Teachta ag r&aacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or gur labhair m&eacute; amach faoi strucht&uacute;r NAMA le fada.  T&aacute; a fhios maith aige freisin go bhfuair an tAire Airgeadais eolas agus comhairle faoi leith &oacute; dhuine a bhfuil eolas aige faoi na nithe seo, agus gur mian leis athraithe ar strucht&uacute;ir NAMA, mar at&aacute; s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair, a thabhairt os comhair an Rialtais.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must point out the NAMA business of tendering is very transparent.  I advise Deputy Adams that if he has a case in which there is clearly a conflict of interest with NAMA, he should report it to the authorities and bring it to public attention.  He is aware of the specific legislation which set up NAMA.  He is also aware of the difficulty and the problems that were experienced by some people who wished to tender for and purchase property in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio and the link established to allow public representatives to make a connection for people who wished to do that.  If Deputy Adams has details of incidents which he considers, or has been informed of, conflicts of interest with NAMA, he should bring it to public attention.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has received some advice about the NAMA structure which he is considering.  He will bring it to the attention of the House when he has made his mind up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Taoiseach who identified the conflict of interest and I am bringing it to public attention.  That is what this question is about.  NAMA has told me some of its senior management have links with 16 of the firms the agency selected to advise it on loans sales.  That is the question.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that since its foundation, NAMA has spent &euro;27.5 million on legal fees, &euro;2.5 million on accountancy fees and projected costs for 2012 are &euro;200 million.  It is also interesting that NAMA will be advancing &euro;568 million to construction activity outside of this island.  Two thirds of its assets are in this State but 50% of its cash advances will be spent in Britain, at a <Col N="27"/>time when almost 500,000 people are on the dole and there are unfinished housing estates spread across every county.  NAMA employs 100 developers, some of whom earn as much as &euro;200,000 a year.  Is this a conflict of interest and does it provide value for money?  More importantly, is it in keeping with the commitments the Taoiseach gave to rectify the situation by establishing a public register and including the names of the creditors and the price paid by the taxpayer for the loans, in addition to the actions taken by NAMA?  The question is whether there is a public register, if the names of the creditors are on it and the amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money that is being spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said to Deputy Adams, the Minister for Finance has received some advice on the improvement in the situation in so far as NAMA is concerned.  I remind him that it is important for the construction industry that there would be some movement in the property market in this country.  I do not want a situation where because of a huge sense of fear on the one hand, as we had before the veneer of everlasting wealth occurred in the country, that somebody is not entitled to take a risk in respect of the purchase of property.  One does not want complete stagnation because that stunts the opportunity to have a thriving construction sector, which is very important both for the economy, job opportunities and trade in general.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams will recall that the Anglo Irish Bank portfolio in the United States, for instance, was moved on quickly to the prime market and resulted in an extensive sale of assets of the order of &euro;8 billion.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has made the point that it is very difficult for him to have a group that can look objectively at the issue without being in some way connected or associated with either a property or persons related to a property that are now involved in the extensive portfolio held by NAMA.  The Deputy is aware that the Minister has not been able to attend the House for personal, family reasons for some weeks.  He is anxious to improve the situation because of the necessity to have a thriving, but not reckless, construction sector.  I am sure when he decides to promote whatever changes he wishes, following the advice he has been given, he will bring it to the House.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that persons who wish to purchase property can either contact the developer or the examiner, as the case might be, or NAMA.  I listened to the chairman of NAMA speak on radio some time ago when he dealt with the question of developers who are still employed by NAMA and on NAMA&rsquo;s books because of their capacity to run some of those enterprises.  He dealt with that in some detail both at the committee and publicly afterwards.  It is an issue in terms of the way NAMA was set up.  It was given a specific remit to return value to the taxpayer.  How one gets the best result on that is what interests the Minister now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that we are going to have a referendum.  It is a good day for democracy and the people of this country.  I hope we have a fair and balanced debate in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the important issue of cuts to people with disabilities.  In recent days there has been a worsening of these cuts.  Many of them are happening behind closed doors with no real knowledge of the details and, more importantly, the hardship that is suffered by people with disabilities and their families.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the cuts to front line services for people with disabilities and is he supporting them behind closed doors?</P>
        <P>There has been a cut of 3.7% to personal assistance funding for people with a physical disability which means isolation for those people.  It is a major step backwards which will result in less choice and a loss of control.  It has all the hallmarks of putting people back into institutions.</P>
        <P>No residential funding is available for St. Michael&rsquo;s House services at a time when 330 people, 47 of whom are in extreme difficulty, are on waiting lists for residential services.  Does the <Col N="28"/>Taoiseach find that acceptable?  St. Michael&rsquo;s House has already experienced cuts of &euro;950,000 in the past seven months.  By the end of the Croke Park agreement savings of more than &euro;3 million will have been achieved by St. Michael&rsquo;s House.  It has done its bit in terms of savings but the Government wants to impose more cuts.  Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why the Government is cutting the domiciliary care allowance and the carer&rsquo;s allowance under the new buzzword, &ldquo;review&rdquo;?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government is now putting extreme pressure and hardship on families of children with disabilities and will he reverse those silent cuts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Finian McGrath is aware that there have been no cuts in headline rates of social welfare payments.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, undertook to draft the strategy on disability last November.  Her report is practically complete.  For the benefit of Deputy Adams, a great deal of ink has been put on reports previously and a lot of toner has been used.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Who is behind the cartridges?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, the Minister is in the concluding stages of presenting the strategy on disability which will point out the pathways to the future in so far as the principle of looking after persons with disabilities is concerned.  I met a number of them myself in the past two weeks.  The Minister for Social Protection introduced the partial capacity benefit in recent weeks to allow persons on disability to gain employment and to be part of the general workforce, which is in the interests of everyone with a disability.  I do not have the details of the individual cases raised by the Deputy but I suggest that, when the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, comes forward with the strategy on disability, we will have an opportunity to have a full and thorough debate on it in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said there would be no cuts.  If that is the case, why are three young mothers from Carlow taking legal proceedings against the Department of Social Protection on foot of its decision to stop the domiciliary care allowance, DCA?  Is the Taoiseach aware that Helen Fahy, Lorraine Ryan and Aimee Doogue, who are mothers of autistic children, had their DCA stopped in the past two months?  They have lost their carer&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;58 per week.  What does he say to those families in the context of there being no cuts?  One of those children has severe social impairment, challenging behaviour, speech delay, is a flight risk without constant supervision, is not toilet trained and has a significant destructive sleep pattern.  The Government is now cutting the child&rsquo;s carer&rsquo;s allowance by &euro;58 per week following a review.  Will the Government challenge those three families in the courts?  How many millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be wasted on fighting those families in the courts and attacking those people who just want a simple, decent service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Finian McGrath will be aware that the domiciliary care allowance has been in place for some years.  He is also aware that it transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection some time ago and that when that took place, review dates were set for the allowances being paid out at the time.  The domiciliary care allowance is subject to a set of conditions and they are monitored by medical assessment, not as a consequence of political policy.  The recipients of the domiciliary care allowance are entitled to avail of the appeals process but the decision was based on medical assessment as distinct from any other criterion.  That was signalled clearly when the domiciliary care allowance was transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection and <Col N="29"/>the review dates were set.  Any reductions are due to decisions made on the basis of medical assessment, not as a consequence of political policy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On foot of an invitation from Professor Klaus Schwab, I travelled to Davos, Switzerland to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, WEF, from 25 to 27 January.  The forum was attended by political and business leaders and heads of international organisations from across the globe.  I participated in a series of discussions that focused on current economic, structural and political challenges and how they might be addressed in a more proactive and integrated manner.  These issues were reflected in the overall theme of the forum &mdash; The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models.</P>
        <P>On Wednesday evening, I attended a function hosted by Professor Schwab, executive chairman of the forum, and also attended by other Heads of Government and the business council of the WEF.  The forum organises a series of formal interactive sessions for the participants.  On Thursday afternoon, I participated as a panellist in a plenary interactive session, entitled &ldquo;Rebuilding Europe&rdquo;, along with Prime Minister Katainen of Finland, President Komorowski of Poland and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.  This session, moderated by Mr. Lionel Barber, editor of the <i>Financial Times</i>, focused on the future of Europe and principally on measures to address financial instability within the eurozone area.  The following day, I participated in a private discussion session on the prevailing global themes for 2012, including the fallout from the Arab spring revolutions of 2011, turbulence in the Middle East, global financial issues and employment, job creation and social stability.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>While I was at the forum, I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt of Denmark and later with Prime Minister Katainen of Finland.  We discussed the current situation in the eurozone and progress in the negotiations towards the new intergovernmental treaty.  I explained the issues that remained of particular importance to Ireland, including in respect of our bank-related debt.  We discussed the growth agenda and I stressed the need to focus on growth and jobs.  I briefed the Prime Ministers on the successful outcome of Ireland&rsquo;s recent EU-IMF quarterly review.  I congratulated Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt on her Government&rsquo;s successful start to the Danish Presidency of the European Union and I said that I looked forward to working with her and her Government over the next five months.  I also updated both Prime Ministers on Ireland&rsquo;s current chairmanship of the OSCE.</P>
        <P>On Thursday evening, I addressed a dinner organised by IDA Ireland and attended by senior executives of major international companies.  I took the opportunity to convey the message that, as a result of the necessary economic adjustments we had made, Ireland was significantly more competitive as a location for doing business.  I noted, for example, that the World Bank rated Ireland as providing the most supportive business environment in the euro area in 2011, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook awarded us three firsts for 2011 &mdash; for corporate tax regime, business legislation for foreign investors and the availability of skilled labour.  I conveyed the same positive messages about Ireland in a series of bilateral meetings with chief executives and other leaders of major multinational firms over the course of my time at the forum.  The IDA event and these bilateral events were very useful opportunities for me to convey strong messages about the attraction of Ireland as a location for foreign investment, research and development and export-oriented operations.</P>
        <P>The World Economic Forum provides an exceptional opportunity to interact with key opinion formers in the business world and I made every effort to take full advantage of it.  I also met with President Martelly of Haiti at his request.  He was on his way to Ireland for a private visit after the forum.  I expressed our continued solidarity with the people of Haiti following the devastating earthquake of 2010 and noted the assistance that had been given by Ireland and the international community towards the recovery programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He has been attending Davos for years and speaking at similar high-level events.  It was the first time that a Taoiseach made comments that reverberated significantly and somewhat negatively at home.  The main theme of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s public comments was that Ireland was doing better because of the 2011 budget against which he voted.  That was fair enough.  However, the main news at home was his unguarded comments regarding the Irish people.  His press people were industrious afterwards in trying to clean up after his comments, but the bottom line is that he claimed it was the fault of people who had gone mad with greed.  No doubt he will have prepared significant remarks.  There has been an attempt to spin the issue with the usual political attacks, but let us put all of that aside for a moment.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he might have gone too far in his comments?  If he does not withdraw them, he must accept that he made one statement in his pre-budget television speech and stated the exact opposite in the Swiss mountains.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was actually my first time to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos.  I found the whole thing very interesting in the sense that it was a gathering of quite influential world leaders in business and politics.  Those who have been attending it for quite a number of years may know of the opportunities that exist for meetings on a one-to-one basis, of which I had a number.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>When I spoke at the panel discussion with the President of Poland, the Prime Minister of Denmark and the Prime Minister of Finland, I set in context what had happened to our country.  It was not so much that the words used were associated with greed.  I made the point that the amount of reckless lending that had gone on and the sort of system that applied &mdash; the more one loaned, the more one got in terms of remuneration and compensation &mdash; led to a point where the situation transformed into one in which property prices and lending policy became reckless.  The result was that, when the bottom fell out of it, it devastated many people.</P>
        <P>I would not say that it was the people from the Government who were very active here.  There were some people on the Deputy&rsquo;s own side who were equally active.  In that sense, I set out for an international audience the background to the situation that applied in this country in so far as the property bubble and property collapse were concerned.  From this point of view, it was important to set that in context.</P>
        <P>Ireland was always a model for other countries in terms of the judicious use of European funding and how to grow an economy.  Obviously, that element of our economy was being driven by taxes from the property market.  When that collapsed, it caused and is causing serious distress for a number of people because of the banking situation and the mortgage distress in which they find themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

	<P>I will revert to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I read the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Davos comments very carefully.  Does he agree that he should apologise to the Irish people?  It was not an awkwardly phrased sentence that meant something else.  He stated that people simply went mad borrowing and the extent of personal wealth created on credit was done between people and the banks, a system that spawned greed to the point where it went out of control.  Does he accept that no one could have interpreted these comments as doing anything other than applying to a substantial number of people and that they were made in an indiscriminate fashion?  Does he not accept that he should at least clarify, if not apologise, to the suffering people of this country for heaping that insult on them on top of what they are undergoing as a result of the crash?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach not realise that, even more recklessly, for him to use words like those is to give justification to the European political establishment to insist that the Irish people pay tens of billions of euro to cover the bad gambling debts of European and other bankers?  The Taoiseach gave the impression that the people were the ones who went mad and, therefore, it was moral that they should pay.  Does he not understand how reckless these remarks were?  Why did the Taoiseach not use the opportunity in front of the world&rsquo;s media to tell the truth?</P>
        <P>The first debate at the World Economic Forum asked whether 20th century capitalism is failing 21st century society.  The Taoiseach attended the forum alongside billionaire speculators from Goldman Sachs and the rest of the people whose greed over 20 years of unrestrained profiteering and speculation in the financial markets caused the global financial collapse.  Why did he not use the opportunity to attack that system and those individuals for their responsibility for a crisis that has caused endless suffering around the world, and even more so in our country?  Does he agree that he lost a great opportunity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No, I do not.  I made my point already.  Perhaps the Deputy does not move out of Dublin as often as he should because if he did so he would be aware that thousands of people came home from work in the evening to find letters from their banks approving loans of &euro;10,000, &euro;15,000 or &euro;50,000 and asking them to come in and collect the money.  Perhaps he <Col N="32"/>is not aware of people who bought not one or two but 10 or 12 apartments over their mobile telephones at the height of the rush of property acquisitions.  Perhaps he is not aware of the consequences in terms of ghost estates and other symbols around the country.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Deputy is speaking from his own narrow focus but I used the limited time available to me to speak with at least seven or eight chief executive officers of international businesses, some whose companies are located here and others who have since decided to propose further investments in this country or are considering investing.  This is a matter of jobs, confidence, hope and opportunities for the future.  I used these face-to-face meetings to express the view that the Government is making serious decisions in the interest of the country.  What we offer as a package in terms of tax, technology, talent and track record is second to none.  Evidence of this can be found in the continuous stream of decisions to invest in this country, including one last week relating to a firm that employs 1,400 people in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.  That is what we need for the future and it is where the future lies.  This is why it was important to speak directly to these individuals when I had an opportunity to express confidence in the facilities and packages that Ireland offers in respect of investments from which jobs can be attracted and developed.</P>
        <P>I could not meet everybody who was in Davos because it was attended by several thousand people from all over the world, but I met a significant number of influential individuals, both politicians and business people.  These business people include some who were happy with the investments they have made in Ireland and who continue to espouse that cause strongly and publicly in the world&rsquo;s media, and others who are considering serious and substantial investments in our country.  I am sure the Deputy supports that work and will also support the investment and jobs that result from it.  Although I had not previously visited Davos, I realised there are strong reasons for taking the opportunity to meet face to face with serious investors and serious players.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Opposition will be third time lucky in giving the Taoiseach an opportunity to clarify his remarks and set the record straight.  I regularly travel out of Dublin. I will visit Castlebar next Friday morning to launch a defending rural Ireland campaign.  If the Taoiseach is available he will be welcome to listen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Where are you launching that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the exact venue but I will send the details to the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy not know Castlebar?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Castlebar well but not the particular venue.  I understand it will not be a big venue.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that people went mad borrowing in a system that spawned greed, went out of control and led to the crash.  The people were at fault.  He and I recognise that there were people who bought a number of apartments but the people who were most offended by his remarks are those who borrowed money to buy a home.  They did not go mad.  They borrowed not out of greed but to provide a home for their families.  Many of them were cajoled to borrow large sums of money to buy homes during boom times.  The prices of these homes had been driven through the roof because the policies of successive governments encouraged property speculation.  The only reason I raise this issue is because the Taoiseach said in his state of the State address that the people were not at fault.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="33"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>In Davos he said that people went mad borrowing.  I do not want to be provocative but the Taoiseach should acknowledge that the people did not cause this crisis.  He knows that and he has said as much on numerous occasions.  All of us say things that are inappropriate or do not properly summarise our thoughts at any given moment.  We all have slips of the tongue.  My concern is that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s failure to clarify his remarks means that he meant them.  This may be an insight into his belief that the Irish people, or at least the people of this State, had a collective burst of madness and were fickle and gullible.  It was not the gombeen men and the greedy bankers and developers who were at fault, it was the ordinary people for being so immature.  I respectfully ask the Taoiseach to set the record straight by making it clear that he does not believe ordinary people caused this crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly do not, and I said clearly in my state of the nation address that the people were not responsible.  The people were the victims.  I never said that all of the people went mad borrowing.  I made the point against the background of explaining matters to an international audience.  When I see the letters that were sent to students to offer large overdrafts or the incentives given to persuade people to take out loans on their houses to spend &euro;100,000 on furniture, &euro;50,000 to tarmacadam the drive and another &euro;50,000 for the BMW, I am reminded that people were the victims of an incentivised scheme which spawned a sense of greed among those in higher echelons.  The more they lent, the more they got.  The implications of that are still being felt by responsible people in the banking system, who are also the victims of public retribution because of the sins of others and the policies that were in place.  Deputy Adams quoted me accurately on this occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I always do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I stand over what I said in my state of the nation address in terms of the people not being responsible.  Many people became victims of an incentivised scheme where they were seduced into borrowing easy money on the assumption that it could all be paid back.  The difficulties in repaying the money were created when the bottom fell out of the construction industry because the economy was being driven by a Government that relied on taxes coming from property.  That was unsustainable and now we know.  This Government has had to make the decisions that will rectify that situation and I am glad to say the country is headed in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I met the CEO of Citibank&rsquo;s operations in Europe, the chief executive of Liberty Global, the chief operating officer of Facebook, the chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange, the chief executive of the EMC corporation, the chief executive of Adobe Systems and the chief executive of Medtronic among a number of other serious business people.  These companies employ thousands of people in Ireland and the satisfaction they get from the talent and productivity of their workforce, as well as the reputation of each individual workforce as part of the country&rsquo;s brand, is very high.  A number of those and others consider investing in Ireland.  At the IDA Ireland function I attended there were half a dozen or a dozen people who had no association with Ireland but are now being followed up with in respect of what we offer in terms of talent and a package in regard to tax, technology and a track record.  I hope that brings about job opportunities for young people in a range of areas in the future.  Please God it will.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Constitution has today forced the Taoiseach and his Government to hold a referendum on the brutal austerity agenda that it and our EU-IMF overlords have been inflicting on the people.  That has happened despite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That has happened despite his best efforts behind the backs of the people to avoid a referendum.  The question relating to Davos is whether the stock in trade of the Government is being two-faced and duplicitous when it comes to saying one thing to the people here and saying quite different things when talking to the high and mighty in Davos or in the European Union.  On the one hand the Taoiseach told the people here he did not blame them and that they were not responsible for the economic crisis.  Then he told people in Davos &mdash; in many cases precisely the people who helped cause the economic crisis and were guilty of all the greed he mentioned &mdash; that people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that some people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that a few super-rich people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that the cronies of Fianna F&aacute;il went mad borrowing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He said that people went mad borrowing.  Is there not a consistency in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s behaviour which is that he says one thing to people abroad and a different thing to people here, whether it is on trying to avoid a referendum on the austerity treaty or on whom to put the blame for the current economic crisis?  Was it not a treacherous thing to say given that on that particular day an all-party delegation, including members of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party, the Labour Party, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Independents, made the case to the Bundestag finance committee that ordinary people in this country were not responsible for the economic crisis and that there should be debt relief?  On that very same day the Taoiseach made a statement to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;gang in Davos blaming ordinary people, fundamentally undermining our case to get a write-down on the debt that has been unloaded on the backs of ordinary people because of the gambling and speculating of international financial institutions and bankers in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That cuts no ice here.  Some of these international audiences are not aware of the history of the historic party of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was important to explain the context in which this property collapse took place.  If the Deputy reads his English, he will notice I did not say &ldquo;all of the people&rdquo; were responsible.  In fact in my state of the nation address I said that the people were not responsible.  I have pointed out to Deputies Martin and Adams how the incentivised scheme in banking regimes fired out money left, right and centre without it even being requested.  Of course the Deputy does not want to accept that.  On the panel discussions in which he has participated he has failed pathetically to explain what he is on about except that he keeps coming up with the recurring words of &ldquo;austerity&rdquo;, &ldquo;hardship&rdquo;, &ldquo;overlord&rdquo; and others.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They know how these problems were caused and know what it takes to sort them out and are prepared to do that.  If Deputy Boyd Barrett were speaking to any of those serious businesspeople considering investing in our country, I wonder what he would say to them.  Would he say &ldquo;Take up your bed and walk&rdquo;?  That seems to be what he seems to say here consistently.  I cannot recall him making one constructive suggestion about employment in his constituency or in any other constituency.</P>

	<P>We have spent 26 minutes on the subject of Davos.  It is up to the Deputies if they want to continue.  There are other questions to be answered.  I call Deputy Martin if he has a genuine supplementary question &mdash; no statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question which I signalled.  I acknowledge that Davos represents a very important networking event.  I had the privilege of attending it and I know that some of the events there broaden the mind and broaden the horizons if one is prepared to be open and listen to what people have to say.  It is a good networking event with people who can create many jobs in the country.</P>
        <P>There is a big debate globally on whether capitalism is in crisis and whether the financial model that has governed in recent decades is in crisis.  The <i>Financial Times</i> has been running a series for some time on the topic.  There was considerable debate at Davos on the big issues.  The origins of this crisis, which has been called the great recession, are much more profound than people sometimes care to admit in the domestic political arena for obvious political reasons.  Mistakes were made here and I have acknowledged those and so on.  However, the fundamentals of the crisis go back some time, particularly to the establishment of the euro and the flawed nature of the euro design.  There were also the events after 11 September 2001 in the US and what the Federal Reserve did.  Essentially in the developed economies across the world cheap money became available, which fuelled bubbles across Europe.</P>
        <P>At Davos, with the exception of Chancellor Merkel and a handful of other European leaders, everybody agreed that Europe had not adequately addressed the economic crisis and particularly the eurozone crisis.  That was the general consensus external to Europe and in many European areas as well.  Economists, journalists, business executives and world leaders at Davos all said that the core flaws in the eurozone have not been addressed and there is a great threat to the international economy as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that such a consensus emerged from the discussions at Davos?  If he listened to those, are they reflected in any of the Government&rsquo;s policies, particularly in the context of the fiscal treaty?</P>

	<P>I was not able to attend many of those discussions which took place in break-out rooms.  I participated in a panel discussion about the European issue with the Prime Minister of Finland and a representative of the Polish Presidency.  I attended a lunch where people were allocated indiscriminate tables where there was a discussion on the issues of the Middle East, including north Africa, Iran and Iraq, the global perspective on the emergence of new economies in the Far East, South Africa and Brazil, and the implications for other countries.  The rest of the time was taken up with face-to-face meetings with individuals.  I did not have an opportunity to sit in as a member of the group in those general discussions that took place in particular rooms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is perfectly clear in what the Deputy says that the financial crisis had its roots in the millions of sub-prime mortgages in the United States, the application of light-touch regulation and how rating agencies allocated a number of these financial instruments and continued to allocate them very high star ratings and then it collapsed.  As the Deputy is aware, billions of dollars worth of those found their way into the European system and the domino effect played its part here.  The conclusions of Davos for me were certainly in the context of the connections it was possible for Ireland to make.  I genuinely believe that a range of those people look at our country now in a different way than they did previously.  They see the results and they know that a solid start has been made although there is a long way to go.  It was important that I had the opportunity as Taoiseach to talk to some of those people face to face.  I am unsure whether I will be invited back again.  I made the point to the professor that I found the exercise very interesting and fruitful.  This has grown over 20 years from a small gathering in the beginning until it exploded into something of a world forum.  Following the Global Irish Economic Forum last October there is a suggestion that Ireland should host a Davos-type conference for those involved in creativity in the theatre, acting and so on in 2014.  This could have implications for the good of the country as well.  That is where it was.  I did not have the chance to sit in at the general discussions, except for the panel discussion and the discussion in respect of the world economic situation, which I was happy to participate in and outline our view at as a member of the eurozone.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will report on the costs of the communications section in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>The cost for the communications unit in 2011 was &euro;221,340 with &euro;98,579 being a direct cost to my Department and the balance being paid by three other Departments.  The cost for 2011 represents a reduction of 9% on the 2010 cost, a reduction of 16% on the 2009 cost and a reduction of 36% on the 2008 cost.  This has been achieved through greater efficiency in the operation of the unit and the application of Government policy on reducing staff numbers.</P>
        <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments.  It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments.  In this way Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>

	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for the answer.  How many people work in the communications unit in total, including the Government information service, the website <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i>, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s press office, speechwriters and so on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The editor of <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> is an assistant principal officer in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Two editorial assistants work on the site as well.  One is an <Col N="37"/>executive officer recently recruited following an interdepartmental competition.  The second is a journalism graduate currently employed on a contract basis.  My Department recently advertised this post through the Public Appointments Service on <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>.  Following interviews, the position will be filled at executive officer level with a starting salary of &euro;27,000.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Economic Management Council has met eight times so far this year, most recently on Tuesday, 14 February.  Since the Economic Management Council has the status of a Cabinet committee, the confidentiality of discussions at the management council are protected by the Constitution.  In line with long-standing practice, it is not appropriate to answer questions about proceedings at the council and the agendas of future meetings.</P>
        <P>Members of the council met with representatives of the three largest banks last Tuesday, 21 February to discuss a range of issues of concern, including small and medium enterprise lending.  This follows up on a similar meeting held on 9 November last.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet committee on climate change and the green economy has met twice in the past year, on 30 June and 20 December 2011.  I expect this committee to meet on a regular basis as we develop policies to meet our challenging emissions reductions targets for the period to 2020.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a problem with the way these questions are grouped.  I asked three questions.  I am particularly interested in trying to get some sense of the meeting between the Economic Management Council and the senior executives of the banks, particularly relating to the issues of citizens on variable rate mortgages who are in deep economic distress at present.  Last week the chief executive of the Bank of Ireland was quoted as saying that it might further increase interest rates to protect the bank from the impact of the Government&rsquo;s new personal insolvency legislation.  The Taoiseach did not answer that question.  He made no reference to the banks in his answer.  The families in mortgage distress are looking to the Taoiseach to <Col N="39"/>ensure the banks reach sustainable agreements with them.  Will the Taoiseach take up this and give us an answer on it?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said that the council has the same status as a Cabinet sub-committee and that under the Constitution it is not appropriate to give details of its meetings.  Surely that is simply an excuse.  Is the Taoiseach suggesting he could be jailed or that it would be a constitutional offence?  Is the Taoiseach a member of a slightly constitutional party?  It strikes me that the information should be available in the interests of transparency.  The Taoiseach has said many times during a long career in the House before he became Taoiseach that he wanted transparency and sought to reform politics.  However, we are trying to get some details from him and he maintains that he cannot tell us anything.</P>
        <P>My first question was about the banks.  The Taoiseach is aware of how many people are in mortgage distress.  Did the Taoiseach raise this with the banks?  Was the Taoiseach successful in getting them to reach sustainable agreements with struggling mortgage holders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is important to distinguish between a meeting of the Economic Management Council, EMC, and a meeting between the council and a group or organisation.  The EMC is a sub-committee of the Cabinet.  Essentially, its purpose is to deal with issues that will, if approved at the EMC, go on to be raised at Cabinet and dealt with in the same way as other issues brought to a Cabinet meeting.  The EMC has met the banks on two occasions.  The first meeting was on 9 November.  The other meeting took place last week on 21 February.  Meetings took place separately with Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  The issues raised included SME credit, mortgage credit, mortgage arrears strategies and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The kind of issues that were raised concerned how banks are ensuring the targets they have set out will be met and practical initiatives to assist SMEs access credit.  As the Deputy knows, both pillar banks said they intend to lend &euro;3.5 billion in new lending this year.  The meetings were very constructive and there is a realisation that banks must get back into the business of explaining to people that they are open for business.  I had the opportunity of launching a small enterprise yesterday in the west, which had secured a loan from Allied Irish Banks.  That enterprise is taking on 15 new employees and hopes to grow the business over the next period.  The issue of SME credit was also raised and the willingness of the banks to implement and support the Government&rsquo;s initiatives set out in the action plan, for instance, the micro-finance agency, a partial loan-credit guarantee and access to the credit review office, which has done a remarkable job.  In that context, the Minister of State and the person with responsibility for the banking sector in the Department of Finance were in Cork yesterday and are in Waterford today talking to businesses and banks about that access.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Adams raised the issue of mortgage credit and asked how banks are ensuring that credit is available to support the Government&rsquo;s important budget initiative.  We asked what checks and balances are there to ensure the conditions that apply to mortgages are fair and balanced and not unduly restrictive, whether banks are monitoring the different outcomes between regions and the movement of houses in the north west or the west, the south west or the south east as against the Dublin area.  They have all that evidence and we are eager that they will support the mortgage interest relief initiative.  With regard to mortgage arrears strategies, the banks are setting out to deal with issues on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the Keane report, personal insolvency and how best to implement a strategy of dealing with individual cases where circumstances are always different.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that came to light is that there is a significant number of small and medium enterprises where the principal person is working hard at driving the business but when the accountants do the books at the end of the tax year, there is often no projection for cash flow for the period ahead.  Clearly, in the past when businesses approached banks seeking loans, the <Col N="40"/>approach was based on property assets and the like and money was made available on that basis.  However, valuations are much lower now and that no longer applies.  Where no cash flow projections are available, this makes it difficult for banks to lend in the circumstances.  Therefore, where this applies within the small and medium enterprise sector, it must be rectified so that when people look for loans and opportunities the application will be turned around quickly.</P>
        <P>We asked questions about what leverage and authority local bank managers have and what was the level of the loans with which they could deal and whether they could deal with unstructured loans of up to &euro;50,000.  We asked what the position was in respect of bigger loans and whether they had to revert along the line and how fast applications could be turned around.  They pointed out there was a single application form and that they were interested in getting out among the community again to talk about the capacity of the banks to lend and the availability of moneys.</P>
        <P>We also discussed the question of the quite substantial deposits flowing back into banks, which are a signal and sign of confidence returning.  The meetings were, in that sense, constructive.  The point was made that the boards have changed, personnel have changed and banks are anxious to get back into the business of being available to the people to lend under proper conditions and to have a thriving banking system and economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the manner in which the Taoiseach responded, I may have stumbled upon a way to get him to answer the question I asked.  I asked him about families in mortgage distress and he responded about credit for small and medium businesses.  Perhaps if I had asked him about credit for small and medium businesses, he would have answered my question about families in mortgage distress.</P>
        <P>I accept the point the Taoiseach made about the small and medium business sector and the need for credit for that sector.  The theory now is that the people now own the banks.  This cost &euro;60 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The Central Bank revealed that 107,708 mortgage holders were in serious distress at the end of 2011.  This means that 92 families fell into mortgage distress every day towards the end of 2011.  In other words, almost 100 families fell into mortgage distress every day from September to December 2011.  My question is straightforward. Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the need for the banks to reach sustainable agreements with these struggling mortgage holders?  Either he did or did not.  If he did, what was the banks&rsquo; response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course we raised the question of distressed mortgages with each of the three banks.  They have set out their strategies, which are parallel to the decisions taken by Government but these strategies will have to be discussed individually because the circumstances of each case are always different.  I pointed out to them that as part of the measures taken in budget 2012, mortgage interest relief was increased to a 30% threshold for first-time buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008.  This was a core commitment in the programme for Government.  I also pointed out the additional measures that exist to assist people in difficulty with meeting their mortgage repayments.  In the majority of cases, there is no intention of doing anything other than bringing about a solution whereby people can continue to live in their homes.  There are a very small number of hopeless cases in the context of being able to achieve a resolution.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware the banks have been recapitalised so as to be able to meet the circumstances that will apply in a number of distressed mortgage cases and they are aware of that.  The revised code of conduct in respect of mortgage arrears came into effect on 1 January 2011, <Col N="41"/>just over a year ago.  Compliance with that code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank and I raised questions with regard to implementation of the code.  With effect from 30 June 2012, lenders must have the required systems in place and must have the trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the code.  As the Deputy is aware, the code sets out the framework with which lenders must deal with regard to borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears.</P>
        <P>We also discussed the implementation of the Keane report, which made ten recommendations.  The Personal Insolvency Bill, which is complex legislation, is currently going through the Oireachtas.  We are also dealing with non-recourse to judicial decisions.  I hope that the parallel steps being taken by the banks, the implementation of the Keane report and the consequences of the Personal Insolvency Bill will bring about a sense of relief for many mortgage holders with difficulties.  The over-riding intention is to bring about a solution for those people so that they will not lose their homes, will receive some relief in terms of repayments and come to an agreement between themselves and the lender as to how best to achieve this.</P>
        <P>I expect to have discussions with the banks again in a couple of months so as to review progress both in respect of lending figures and with how they are getting on with the extent of arrears and distressed mortgage holders they have on their books.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I submitted two questions, one on the economic management council and the other on the issue of climate change and the green economy.  However, that second question has somehow got mixed up with the four questions on the economic management council.</P>
        <P>The people are very angry about the banks.  In particular, given the recapitalisation, the people are angry the banks are not doing what the Government and others have said the banks will do or should be doing.  I have made the point previously that there is a disconnection between the articulation of issues here and what is happening on the ground.  People we meet on the streets and at our clinics say that what is going on is crazy.  The situation in relation to mortgage interest arrears is getting worse.  There has been no alleviation of the stress people are under.  If anything, the strain is getting worse.  There is no sense that the banks are responding in the spirit of the recapitalisation agenda.  The entire approach to saving the banks was predicated on ensuring they would be in a position to meet the needs of the economy and the people.  That is particularly true of the mortgage arrears issue.  I remind the House that issues of mortgage difficulty and impairment were taken on board when the banks were recapitalised.</P>
        <P>I heard what the Taoiseach had to say about micro-enterprises.  People who have been in business for a long time are still contacting me to say their companies have been denied working capital.  Many jobs are riding on the sustainability of the companies in question.  I am talking about small businesses that have had good experiences in the past and business people who have not done anything untoward or been in any great difficulties.  They are now finding it hard to access money, however.  Regardless of all the big documents and action plans for jobs, the fastest way to create jobs is to provide for a meaningful system of access to credit for people and micro-enterprises.  Mortgage arrears issues also need to be dealt with comprehensively and decisively because they are having a detrimental impact on families and households.  This problem is acting as a drag on the economy by dampening consumer demand and sentiment.  People are not prepared to spend money in the absence of clarity on mortgage arrears issues.  I ask the Government to take on board the proposals we have made in that regard.  The decisions of the debt settlement office should be binding on the banks.  We can no longer let the banks make decisions on what they will and will not agree to.  They are not responding to the sentiments that are being articulated here and across the country.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="42"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely upfront here.  Umpteen cases of people who cannot access credit &mdash; they have been turned down by their banks &mdash; have been brought to my attention.  When they are asked about making an appeal to the Credit Review Office, some of them say they do not want to get into a bad situation with the local bank manager with whom they are dealing.  When one talks to the banks, one is told that some businesses come in without a projection of what their cash flow might be.  Previously, one could be sure that the banks would give it out against the property.  It is fair to say this is a central issue in this regard.  Small businesses around the country are willing to borrow for employment and export purposes.  Enterprise Ireland is pushing very hard for new entrepreneurs, new innovators and new developers to get into business.  Such people require financing.  Yesterday, for the first time in a while, I spoke to a bank manager who had given a loan to a small business.  The business in question is taking on 15 new employees and hopes to expand further in the coming period.  It is important for that manager and his colleagues in the bank to be able to say publicly that they believe in a business and are prepared to lend money to it.  That will reassure anyone who is listening that the bank is open for business and offering packages to those who are interested.</P>
        <P>I am not a proponent of the banks.  I have had strong differences of opinion with them.  As Deputy Martin is well aware, we need a banking system that actually works.  Bank managers should be authorised to do the job they are supposed to do, in conjunction with business people.  They need to manage mortgage distress and arrears and facilitate business opportunities.  If we do not have thriving small and medium sized enterprises, we will never have the kind of country that Deputy Martin and I know we can have.  The banks have told us at the economic management council that their own credit and micro-finance operations are proceeding in parallel with what the Government is doing.  They are engaging in discussions with people who have distressed mortgages, in line with the Keane report and in the context of the personal insolvency proposals.</P>
        <P>The meeting I have mentioned was constructive.  Representatives of a number of banks from various parts of the country gave evidence to the effect that there are signs that things are beginning to move in some sectors.  There is a very long way to go.  I have heard reports that suggest the housing floor has not yet been reached.  People will wait for a further period to see what happens.  In the recent past, I have met a number of solicitors who have finalised transactions regarding the sale of houses.  I hope the banks will be willing to come back in again in a couple of months to review the progress that is being made.  I hope the House will have made further progress with the implementation of the Keane report and the personal insolvency legislation.  We want the banks to sit down with people who have mortgage arrears to decide how to work this out.  The banks are aware that they have been recapitalised to deal with significant numbers of such cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It may be politically expedient in the short term to put them to one side.  I do not get any sense that the Government is engaging with the fundamental energy and climate change challenges that will face this country and the world as a whole in the years ahead.  The fact the Cabinet sub-committee has met on just two occasions is a manifestation of the Government&rsquo;s inertia on these issues.  It is failing to engage with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is directly responsible for the issue of climate change.  The Minister announced last November, in conjunction with the publication of a review of national climate change policy, that an independent study would be carried out by the secretariat to the National Economic and Social Council.  The study will inform policy development in this regard.  On 23 January last, following engagement with the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Minister published a work programme setting out the steps and milestones for the development of national climate policy legislation.  That work programme covers the next 18 months.  A process of public consultation will take place in the first half of 2012.  The initial report of the NESC secretariat on potential climate policies and measures will be completed by the end of June and published in the second half of the year.  The heads of a climate Bill will be developed and, following Government approval, will be considered by the joint committee by the end of 2012.  The 2012 final report of the NESC secretariat will be considered by the committee in the first half of 2013.  The work programme we have set out contains a number of milestones.  We hope that process will conclude with the heads of the Bill having been considered by the committee by this time next year.</P>

	<P>What role, if any, will the economic management council have in the implementation of the jobs programme that was announced by the Government recently?  Will it have an overseeing role?  Will various agencies of the State have to answer to it?  How will the economic management council supervise the achievement of the target of creating 100,000 net jobs by 2015?  As that has not been clarified, I ask the Taoiseach to do so now.  What is the Government&rsquo;s estimate of the number of jobs that will be lost in the meantime?  If the Government has a net estimate for job creation, such a figure must be known to it as well.  Everybody considers that in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The lips of the Minister for Education and Skills have not ceased to move since we started Question Time.  That leads me to believe he might be playing the role of a political ventriloquist today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to proceed.  We are over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be so impolite to say what that might make the Taoiseach.  Many people consider that several billion euro of the bailout money to the banks was related to difficulties with household mortgages which the banks have not reflected in their policy of writing down debt.  Is this the Taoiseach&rsquo;s understanding?  Surely the alternative to having unfortunate people dragging mountains of debt around, with the accompanying stress and with unsustainable mortgage repayments, is that the mortgages should be written down to the current level of value of the house and in this way get rid of that overhang and allow people to spend their money in the real economy which would help to create jobs.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="44"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins is actually putting forward a proposition which is unusual for him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not unusual at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank him.  As regards the mortgages situation, I have responded to questions from Deputy Martin and Deputy Adams.  I refer to the range of issues in the Keane report, the consequences of the passage of the personal insolvency Bill through the parliamentary process and the fact that the banks have been recapitalised and, in a number of cases, they have the opportunity to write down mortgages by sitting down with each individual client borrower.  The difference is between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  However, having had discussions with the banks, I hope they will move on and make a real impression by releasing that pressure valve which exists in the case of so many people.</P>
        <P>In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the jobs action programme, this is being overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach along with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Assistance in this work has been provided by two experts who have joined the Department of the Taoiseach from Forf&aacute;s for the work of monitoring and overseeing the programme.  The Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will publish a report on the implementation of the action plan and the matters being dealt with.  The agencies associated with individual Ministers and their Departments will respond by 9 March 2012 to a letter they will receive from the Department of the Taoiseach on this matter.  The first quarter of the year will see a range of initiatives being implemented.  I am launching an initiative next week entitled Succeeding in Ireland.  This will provide an opportunity for the diaspora in America or Australia or wherever to be associated with the opportunity to recommend propositions for job opportunities.  On each of those occasions I expect the quarterly published report can be debated in the House so that Deputies can give their views on whether the initiatives are bearing any fruit and whether the programme is up to date.  I intend to see that the programme is implemented and Secretaries General, Ministers and the chief executives of the agencies involved will all receive this in writing and will be given the timelines within which they must respond.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is much appreciated.  I have a question about promised legislation on the fiscal treaty.  Given the earlier announcement about a referendum, I ask the Taoiseach to outline to the House whether he intends to establish a forum within the House to discuss this matter in greater detail.  When will the Referendum Commission be appointed?  When is the fiscal responsibility Bill to be published?  I ask for the timeline for the appointment of the Referendum Commission, the publication of the legislation and the holding of the referendum.  Will a significant public information campaign be organised on the content of the treaty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin will recall that on my return from the EU Council meeting where the text of the treaty was agreed, I advised the Cabinet the following morning and the T&aacute;naiste wrote to the Attorney General.  It was made clear on many occasions that arising from the legal advice of the Attorney General the Government would act appropriately.  Just this morning the Attorney General advised the Cabinet of her view that, on balance, a referendum would be necessary in order to ratify the treaty.  For that reason, the Government made that decision just this morning.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I confirm that work on the fiscal responsibility Bill has been advanced in the past number of weeks and it will be produced in this session.  I expect to have some further information tomorrow when the House discusses the statements on the pre-European Council.  The Government will be required to produce a referendum Bill in advance of a referendum, to appoint a Referendum Commission, and to put in train the processes necessary to lead to the question to be asked in the referendum.  The House will have the opportunity to debate the matter thoroughly and comprehensively so that people will be properly informed.  The referendum will be a brilliant opportunity for Irish people to look to the future of the country, of our people and our place in the European process and an opportunity to consolidate confidence and investment in jobs as a consequence.  The Government did not consider the timeline today but we will decide over the next period how best to deal with it.  The work on the fiscal responsiblity Bill is advanced and it will be dealt with this session.  I will give more details tomorrow about the process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach consider a special sub-committee of the Committee on European Affairs to consider the treaty and the referendum Bill?  There is a need for detailed all-party discussion with a view to getting a grip on the treaty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I am raising proposed legislation to which I will refer when I finish my sentence.  Arising from the fact that expert opinion seems to have prevailed heretofore and notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in regard to the reorganisation of the HSE, is it possible to introduce the health information Bill as a matter of some urgency to enable all Members of the national Parliament to debate this issue?</P>
        <P>Arising also from an issue which received considerable publicity in recent times where a successful insurance claim was made against the victim of a crime which, to my mind, creates a serious problem for our society, could the criminal justice (victims rights) Bill be introduced in the House to ensure the majority of the Members of the House of Parliament have an opportunity to speak on this issue on behalf of those who are victims?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy a date in respect of the second Bill.  I do not have any difficulty with the Chief Whip making arrangements for a discussion here on the question of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The Government considered it this morning and will reflect on its determination to see that this flag-ship project is built.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government made a deliberate and conscious decision to build a national children&rsquo;s hospital <Col N="49"/>and has in place a funding model to fund it.   The Government is very anxious to pursue and implement its decision.  The health information Bill will be introduced in mid-2012.</P>

	<P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about two proposed Bills.  Is there a provision in the proposed social welfare and pensions Bill to cover self-employed people who have become unemployed and who find themselves with no entitlements and with obstacles in their way to up-skilling for future employment?</P>
        <P>I asked the following question some time ago but is there a definite date for the National Vetting Bureau Bill?  It is supposed to be taken in this session but is there a definite date because it is causing difficulties for people in part-time employment and students in employment who change employment at short notice and, therefore, must begin the whole process again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of self-employed people is one which the Minister for Social Protection is considering.  It is not possible for me to give the Deputy an answer in respect of the content of the Bill but it is an issue for consideration by the Minister.  In respect of the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the necessity for up-skilling, this is the central point of the pathways to work scheme which was launched last week by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Education and Skills and I.</P>
        <P>The National Vetting Bureau Bill is an issue of some concern.  I am aware of a number of cases where similar things to which the Deputy referred have happened.  I do not have a date for it but I will get the Minister to respond in detail to him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>On 22 February, I raised the issue of pro-eating disorder websites at a briefing on eating disorders by Bodywhys that coincided with eating disorder awareness week.  These websites define and promote anorexia and bulimia as conscious choices and a lifestyle.  They are called pro-ana and pro-mia websites and exploit the vulnerability of people whose ability to reason logically is impaired.  Sites often contain sections such as thinspiration, with inspiring text and photos of very thin celebrities or manipulated photographs.  A tips and tricks section offers information on the calorie values of certain foodstuffs and drugs, as well as suggestions to mask dieting behaviour and the anorexic body shape.</P>
        <P>A study published online in the European Eating Disorder Review in January 2009 was based on research on school students in Belgium.  Some 12.6% of girls and 5.9% of boys aged 13, 15 and 17 had access to pro-anorexic websites.  Visiting such sites was associated with a higher drive for thinness and higher levels of perfectionism.  No such figures are available for Ireland but, based on the number of people who have contacted me as a Deputy, ex-school principal and teacher, I have no doubt that the figures are just as depressing for Ireland.  Bodywhys points to the dangers of the websites, such as that they are potential triggers into an unhealthy, destructive lifestyle, that people can get competitive about how thin they are, and that an unwell person can see weight loss control as an achievement whereas it is a reflection of obsessive and potentially deadly behaviour.  These sites can encourage and maintain the disorder.  They can be salacious, sensationalist and disrespectful of the dignity of people affected by eating disorders.  They also show a lack of respect for professionals, clinicians and researchers who devote their time to the study and treatment of eating disorders and related problems.</P>
        <P>America, France and the UK have made efforts to block access to such websites but have not been successful.  It is important that Ireland also investigates ways to protect our young and vulnerable people and learns from actions taken by other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor for raising this important issue and I share her concerns.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for mental health issues.  The Internet is an international and worldwide phenomenon.  It has no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  Therefore, efforts to combat harmful material and activities on it can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems and differing societal norms.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>In this instance, many of the pro-eating disorder websites which the Deputy refers to may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they are subject to the US jurisdiction, the free speech provisions of the US Constitution apply and the action that could be taken against them here is limited.  While acknowledging these difficulties, there is a self-regulatory framework in place for Internet service providers in Ireland.  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland code of practice and ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material online.</P>
        <P>Although treatment services was not the primary issue raised, a special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided for mental health in budget 2012 in line with the programme for Government commitments, part of which will support the treatment of eating disorders.  The &euro;35 million funding will primarily be used to strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services.  Over 400 additional staff will be recruited to support initiatives under this package.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with the scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes currently being developed.  Three areas will be prioritised this year, one of which will be the treatment and care of patients with eating disorders.</P>
        <P>HSE services for people with eating disorders are embedded in the community mental health service and with primary care.  Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to the primary care practitioner with complications of their condition and early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.  The HSE has developed a mental health in primary care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners with Dublin City University with a view to enhancing the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses, including eating disorders, within the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>The HSE also provides funding to Bodywhys, the national voluntary organisation supporting those with eating disorders to which Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor referred.  Bodywhys provides a range of support services for people affected including specific services for families and friends.  Bodywhys also works closely with the health promotion units throughout the HSE.  I can assure the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, that the management and care of eating disorders and mental health services generally will continue to be a priority for this Government.  I will pass on the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the Internet and access to information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am heartened to hear the response of the Minister of State.  I am very concerned about the number of parents in my constituency who contacted me about these websites.  I looked at them for research purposes and I was shocked by the images of thin people proffered as thinspiration.  There is also the promotion of a bracelet project, where pro-mia or bulimic sufferers, are advised to wear blue beaded bracelets around their right wrists and pro-ana or anorexic girls are encouraged to wear red beaded bracelets around their left wrists, which allows children to identify other followers and foster a sense of community.  We can be cocooned in the House and not realise what is going on with our vulnerable young people.  Another website has a list of the thin commandments, containing instructions for sufferers such as &ldquo;if you aren&rsquo;t thin, you aren&rsquo;t attractive&rdquo;, &ldquo;what the scale says is the most important thing&rdquo; and &ldquo;being thin and not eating are signs of true willpower and success&rdquo;.  These websites are promoting unhealthy and dangerous diseases as lifestyle choices.  As a Government, I am glad we are exploring ways of protecting our vulnerable people and I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that Internet service providers of Ireland have a code of practice. <Col N="53"/> I call on the Internet service providers to look at the websites mentioned and ensure minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints.</P>

By raising the matter, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor has done a service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, I am sorry that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not present because he will be taking the decision on the Providence Resources foreshore licence.  My appeal is to him in the first instance but also to the Government more generally to reject the Providence Resources foreshore licence application to drill for oil or gas in Dublin Bay.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that those who are concerned or opposed to the drilling live in Dalkey and the immediate vicinity of the proposed drilling.  I want to emphasise that this is an issue for the whole of Dublin Bay and has wider national ramifications in terms of environmental, public consultation and planning issues, as well as the management of this country&rsquo;s natural resources.</P>
        <P>The proposed drilling is to take place 6 km off Dalkey.  Even Providence Resources admits there would be potential for oil spills.  The Government has to understand if there was an oil spill that close to the coast the whole of Dublin Bay would be contaminated within hours.  There would simply be no way to prevent the oil coming ashore.  As I understand it, it will not be the responsibility of Providence Resources to prevent that happening, rather it would be the Irish Coast Guard.  We would have no chance of stopping major contamination of the entirety of Dublin Bay, given the proximity of such oil drilling if the project goes into production as an oil well.</P>
        <P>That is a risk too far for Dublin Bay.  Any economic advantages that we might hope to derive from producing oil or gas would be completely outweighed by the environmental damage that would be done to one of the most important natural amenities in this country and the most important natural amenity in Dublin.  It could ruin tourism, the marine environment, our beaches and our natural heritage and do all sorts of damage which makes the risk too great to take.</P>
        <P>One might consider taking that risk if there was some significant economic advantage.  I would not take the risk, but some people who are desperate, given the current economic climate, might think it is a risk worth taking if the State got something back in terms of jobs and revenue.  Such is the licensing arrangement in this country that we will get virtually nothing back.</P>
        <P>The company is allowed to write off 25 years of previous losses and capital costs before tax kicks in on any profits it would make.  Given the fact that Providence Resources is partnered by an Malaysian multinational, there would also be the opportunity of transfer pricing of costs incurred elsewhere in the multinational which means that virtually nothing would come back <Col N="54"/>to the State.  The only beneficiaries would be Providence Resources and a Malaysian multinational.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, there is simply no case whatsoever for allowing drilling close to the coastline in Dublin Bay.  In Norway, no oil drilling takes place closer than 25 km to the coast.  Wherever there is oil drilling, there is a public inquiry.  The Government is refusing to grant a public inquiry on this licence.  In Norway, the state gets 70% of the profits and revenues from oil production, while we will get next to nothing.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to take risks with Dublin Bay, reject the foreshore license application and, at an absolute minimum, give us a public inquiry before any decision is made to grant such a licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  He was not able to be here to reply to the debate.  I will convey the views of the Deputy, of which he is aware, to him.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter for debate.</P>
        <P>Primary policy responsibility for the exploitation of offshore natural resources, including the tax regime applicable to such projects, is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Such projects are subject to a number of statutory consents under the Gas Acts and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act.  Projects involving works within the 12 nautical mile outer limit of the foreshore are also subject to consent under the Foreshore Acts.</P>
        <P>The Department received an application from Providence Resources for a foreshore licence in respect of site investigations and the drilling of an exploratory well off Dalkey.  I am advised that this is the first such application under foreshore legislation for this type of project.  Notice of the application was published in the press on 5 January 2012.  The notice provided details of how the application and accompanying information could be inspected and the means by which the public were invited to make submissions on the proposal.</P>
        <P>The application and supporting information were available for inspection in hard copy at two Garda stations and are available electronically on the websites of the Department and the project proponent.  The closing date for the receipt of submissions by the Department was 2 February 2012.  In the order of 700 individual submissions, of which 350 are duplicates, and 4,100 submissions of the same online petition were received by the Department during the public consultation period.  All submissions received have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website and have been forwarded to the applicant inviting its response to the issues raised.</P>
        <P>The licence application will be the subject of an environmental assessment by the scientific and technical advisers on the marine licence vetting committee.  Their assessment will involve a detailed examination of the application, related information and issues raised in submissions received from the public and prescribed bodies, and the applicant&rsquo;s responses to those issues.  I expect the environmental assessment will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, potential impacts on European sites, sensitive species, other legitimate uses within the area the subject of the application and navigation issues.</P>
        <P>A determination will be made on the application in due course, taking account of the recommendations of the marine licence vetting committee and the Department.  Should the project progress to commercial exploitation, it would be the subject of further formal applications for consents from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in the first instance, and then An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning Acts, and a full lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts, all of which will require the submission of an environmental impact statement and environmental impact assessments by the relevant consent authorities.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="55"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all too late.  Now is the time to act.  If Providence Resources discovers oil or gas in any significant quantities it is unprecedented for any company in that situation not to be allowed to go into production.  In reality, this matter will be decided on this application. Normally such applications are not allowed. </P>
        <P>Countries like Norway, where best practice is followed, simply do not allow drilling for oil or gas close to coastlines.  The public consultation process that went into this application was pathetic.  Providence Resources must have had years to prepare its application.  The public only found out about it because local residents groups in Dalkey, Protect Our Coast and Save Our Seafront, rang the alarm bells and public meetings were called at very short notice to inform people they needed to make submissions.</P>
        <P>It was only in the immediate area of Dalkey and D&uacute;n Laoghaire that people had time to do that.  People in Sandymount, Ringsend, Clontarf, Fairview and Greystones were not informed of the application even though they would be directly affected if there were any damaging environmental consequences.  For that reason, there should be a proper public inquiry so that every stakeholder and resident in the Dublin Bay area is given an opportunity to have his or her say.</P>
        <P>Best international practice is that one does not allow drilling so close to the coast.  There is always a public inquiry, drilling takes place at safe distances out at sea and the state gets a proper share of the revenues.  None of those criteria is in place.  Therefore, there is no reason to take this risk or allow the licence to proceed.  I appeal to the Government to reject the foreshore licences, establish rules that will safeguard our environment and have proper public consultation and management of natural resources in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State responsible for housing, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, for attending.  The revelation last week that there are serious fire safety problems at Belmayne, Dublin 13, was absolutely shocking to residents of the estate and to people across the whole Dublin north fringe in Dublin North-East.  After the Priory Hall disaster, it is truly incredible that another problem of fire safety has arisen close-by in Belmayne.  In other areas of the north fringe, residents already faced the ongoing challenges of dealing with pyrite remediation and the Priory Hall issue.  They now face another appalling set of circumstances.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>I was first informed by the voluntary housing body Cl&uacute;id that at least 225 homes in the area are affected by the fire safety problem.  Some media reports state up to 300 homes are affected.  Could the Minister of State clarify this?  Does she know how many homes will have to be evacuated while repairs are being carried out?  How long will it take?  How will residents be rehoused and compensated while their homes are subject to remediation work?</P>
        <P>The first priority is to resolve the matter for Belmayne residents and to ensure the fire safety features in all homes on the estate and the whole north fringe are of the highest possible standard and subject to remediation.  Serious questions need to be asked yet again about the planning and fire safety regulatory authorities and how this situation could possibly have occurred yet again in the north fringe.  Residents feel the Department, Dublin City Council and the developer, builder and management company &mdash; Kitara Limited, LM Developments and Stanley Holdings &mdash; have kept them in the dark and let them down very badly in respect of the way in which this matter has come to public attention.  It has been reported, for example, that fire-stopping features in the homes involved are defective because of a small gap having been left in the plasterboard dry lining.  This would allow smoke and fire through if a fire were to take place.</P>
        <P>I contacted the fire chief, the Dublin City Council housing manager, Mr. Brady, the city manager, Mr. Tierney, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, last week and asked a number of questions that I would like the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, to answer this afternoon.  I want to know whether the fire brigade invigilated the estate and when the fire safety certificates were issued, and whether the fire brigade raised any concerns regarding the timber frame construction of apartments and homes.  A very unusual method of construction was used in a significant part of Belmayne.  Most important, did the fire brigade ask about fire safety standards when the city manager, Mr. John Tierney, recently purchased 45 units, which are managed for the local authority by Cl&uacute;id?  Can the Department, Dublin City Council and the fire brigade confirm that constituents are not in immediate danger?  Can an urgent repair programme be carried out without the evacuation of all the affected homes?  What urgent action will the fire authority and Dublin City Council take to ensure the safety of my constituents?</P>
        <P>The executive manager of the fire brigade told me that, in early 2011, investigations were carried out in Belmayne estate by the fire brigade following complaints by three residents.  The investigation concluded that Dublin Fire Brigade is not recommending any further action in relation to the Belmayne development, yet we heard one of the householders concerned complain bitterly on the Joe Duffy show last week that this issue was not followed up at the time.  I hope the Minister of State will answer these questions.</P>
        <P>It was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> this Sunday that, in 2006, inspections of Priory Hall estate were carried out by officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and that a departmental inspector subsequently raised fire safety and building control concerns, including the absence of fire collars on pipes and poor and inadequate insulation.  This was in addition to a health and safety investigation in 2006 which closed down the Priory Hall estate as it was being built.  Ms Sin&eacute;ad Power, one of the outstanding leaders of the Priory Hall residents and a constituent of mine, asked me today whether the Department knew about fire safety defects in 2006 and whether her life and those of all her neighbours were put at risk by the Department for the past five years.  Will the Minister of State respond to these allegations regarding the continuing Priory Hall debacle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  I may not be able to answer all the questions today but I will certainly revert to the Deputy on those I am unable to answer in so far as that is possible.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>I understand that Dublin City Council, through Dublin Fire Brigade, was notified by the developer of a construction defect in some properties at the Belmayne housing complex on 19 January 2012.  The developer, acting responsibly in consultation with his fire engineer, consulted the local authority and undertook to carry out remedial works to all affected properties.  The fire officer carried out an inspection and determined that remedial action was necessary and timely.  Having regard to a number of alternative fire safety controls within the complex which are all functioning and subject to a regular maintenance programme, the fire officer was satisfied that evacuation was not called for.  Further inspections were carried out by the fire office on a number of vacant units after which the fire officer was satisfied the remedial works proposed will remedy the defect.  Remedial works have already begun, and are likely to take up to one week for each affected apartment.</P>
        <P>Clearly this is a stressful and distressing situation for the residents concerned.  Residents will be offered alternative accommodation in Belmayne or nearby for the few days while the repairs are being carried out on their apartments, to minimise the inconvenience to them caused by dust and noise.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council and the fire consultants for the developer have agreed on the necessary remedial works.  These will involve inserting fire-proof board to seal a 75 mm gap in the voids above ceilings and the removal of service ducts to be rebuilt with full fire-proofing construction.  A project manager has been assigned to oversee the works with the assistance of two superintendent inspectors, clerks of works. Works on all the affected apartments are expected to be completed within three months.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the building regulations is first and foremost the responsibility of the building owner and developer.  Enforcement is a matter for the local building control officer in whose functional area the relevant building is situated.  Neither the Minister nor the Department has any direct role in enforcement.</P>
        <P>The responsible parties in this case are facing up to their obligations in carrying out remediation works and bearing that cost together with the costs of relocating residents.  This is clearly not a similar situation to that in Priory Hall.</P>
        <P>With regard to Priory Hall, the legal proceedings are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.  In particular, the appeal by Dublin City Council against the court order to pay the costs associated with providing alternative accommodation for the residents will be heard by the Supreme Court on 24 April 2012.</P>
        <P>The overriding priority in relation to Priory Hall is to facilitate the return by residents to their homes as early as possible.  In this respect, it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its power to achieve this objective.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council on the evolving circumstances at Belmayne and Priory Hall.</P>
        <P>We all share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the effect on the residents in both estates.  I hope the people of Belmayne will be reassured that they will have to leave their homes only for a relatively short period.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  She and the Labour Party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who met residents of Priory Hall, are partly responsible for trying to unwind the terrible circumstances, particularly for the 48 families of owner-occupiers.  Have any proposals been brought to the Cabinet&rsquo;s economic management committee regarding the relevant financial institutions and the mortgage difficulties of Priory Hall owner-occupiers?</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>The Minister of State did not address the question I asked on the tranche of perhaps 90 homes bought relatively recently in Belmayne by the city manager and Cl&uacute;id.  Were they invigilated by the fire safety authority and Dublin city council specifically before they were purchased?</P>
        <P>The north fringe has the potential to be a wonderful new urban district.  People often reflect on the fact that this huge territory, an urban district the size of Tralee or Waterford, was to be built over a few years and was to have a very high population density, with 30,000 or 40,000 people.  Grave mistakes were made there, particularly by the last city manger, Mr. John Fitzgerald.  With all those difficulties, the north fringe now stands on a precipice.  It is up to the Minister of State to try to lead the way to ensure the estate turns out to be beneficial.</P>
        <P>I have called endlessly, under the legislation of 2004, for a commission of inquiry into all aspects of the planning and development of the north fringe.  Looking back at the record of the past five years, since the Pyrite scandal broke in 2007, a short sharp investigation is needed.  We have an organisation in Dublin city, which I proposed, called the North Fringe Forum.  The area is not a strategic development zone but would the Minister of State consider making the north fringe an SDZ to give it a statutory basis?  Would she also consider appointing directly from the Department some sort of executive manager, overseer, czar or gauleiter?  He or she could be put in charge of remedying the difficulties we now have in the north fringe.  He or she could be in charge of the local area plans to try to get this project back on the rails.  Otherwise, this has the potential to be one of the biggest disasters in the history of Irish planning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I may not have the answers to all of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions and, if not, I can revert to him later.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with a number of legacy issues concerning things that were not done properly in the past.  We must learn from them for the future and ensure that we put proper systems in place so they cannot possibly recur.  We are working on that and will put such systems in place.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, I am determined to do that.  We will certainly examine the Deputy&rsquo;s general suggestions on the north fringe because, as a local representative in the area, he is more familiar with the situation than I am.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked me about the number of people affected as well as whether inspections were undertaken prior to taking over certain properties.  I do not have a direct answer on inspections but I know that about 300 dwellings, which is approximately 25% of the units at Belmayne, are affected by the immediate problem.  They include private residents as well as local authority and voluntary housing body tenants.  Therefore, a number of different types of residents are affected.</P>
        <P>As regards Priory Hall, I have been in touch with the Dublin city manager, as has the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  There are ongoing discussions, as the Deputy is aware.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the House personally and I know he has made a significant effort to be here.</P>
        <P>It has been decided that bills of under two units per day, which I understand from the ESB is equivalent to having a fridge freezer on all the time, or using a cooking plate for 20 minutes, or having four 60W bulbs on for three hours, will be charged at a higher standing charge.  This is focused at vacant dwellings and holiday homes that are vacant for most of the year.  At first glance, one might say &ldquo;Fair enough, if you can afford to have a vacant home&rdquo;, but there are many reasons why houses are vacant and why somebody may wish to leave a fridge freezer on.  People may have had to go away to get work, for example.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not as if there was not an alternative to what is being proposed.  I understand the ESB is stating that the saving would be &euro;8.5 million for 170,000 customers.  It is hard to see how that saving would be made, but it is what the ESB states.  That means there is a saving of &euro;50 per customer per annum.  In some case, however, that can rise to an extra charge of &euro;150 per customer.  What justification did the ESB give for this?  It said it is more expensive to read meters, in addition to which the company must send out bills and administer customer services.  It seems rather strange, however, that there would be customer services for vacant houses.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will take up this matter with the ESB and tell the company that if houses are vacant for large parts of the year, customers could perhaps agree to be billed once or twice a year.  In that way savings could be made with fewer meter readings and bills, and all the other excuses the ESB is using for this charge.  What is the point in sending out a bill for less than two units a day?</P>
        <P>The Minister should tell the ESB that there is another way of solving this problem, which is very simple.  People with properties lying vacant for extended periods should notify the ESB so that the meter will not be read and they will not get a bi-monthly bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for making an effort to be here.  The ESB is increasing the standing charge for customers who use less than two units of electricity per day.  According to the ESB&rsquo;s own figures, this will amount to &euro;9.45 in a two-month bill or &euro;56 over an entire year&rsquo;s billing period.  It mainly concerns vacant dwellings, including holiday homes.  One unit of electricity amounts to using an electric shower for ten minutes, operating a washing machine for 90 minutes, or watching a 28-inch television for nine hours.  Most of us use 14 units of electricity per day and will thankfully be exempt from the standing charge.</P>
        <P>To be fair, the Minister has said that people in receipt of a free electricity allowance will be exempt, as will those on an ESB household budget plan or with pay-as-you-go meters.  It is also important to exempt elderly people who may have vacated their dwellings to live in nursing homes, may be ill in hospital or may be living with a son or daughter.</P>
        <P>I am amused by the ESB stating the standing charge is for administrative costs because the company has changed its meter-reading process, certainly in Cork city.  The ESB is increasingly moving away from meter reading, so I would like to hear an explanation for that.  The ESB should clearly set out which customers will be affected by this increase.  I hope the Minister will agree that we must protect low-income households from this increase, and the elderly in particular.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s role is crucial in this matter.  The ESB must answer to its shareholders and explain this decision fully.  If we look closely at those who should be offered exemptions from this increase, I think we will find that the net will get bigger.</P>

	<P>He is in training.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Buttimer to the fact that responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory body.</P>
        <P>The residential electricity market has changed dramatically over the past two years with the introduction of competition.  Suppliers are required to respond to competitive pressure while at the same time maintaining a balance between business viability and customers&rsquo; needs.  Prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated since April 2011.  Price setting by electricity suppliers, including Electric Ireland, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.</P>
        <P>The regulator was established in 1999 to regulate the electricity sector in Ireland.  In 2002, its remit was extended to cover the natural gas market.  The regulator is independent of all operators in the market and acts in the best interest of energy customers in Ireland by working to ensure that consumers benefit from regulation and the introduction of competition in energy markets.</P>
        <P>An electricity supplier can increase or decrease the rates charged to customers in line with what has been signed up to in the contract.  This may include increasing or decreasing the unit rate, the standing charge, or any additional charges on bills.</P>
        <P>Deregulation enables business and domestic customers to engage proactively with suppliers and seek better value offers from them and-or switch to other suppliers with lower prices.  Since deregulation, Ireland has had some of the highest switching rates in Europe.  Switching to an alternative supplier can deliver immediate benefits to consumers.  The process is quick, easy and capable of delivering real savings to every household and business.</P>
        <P>The background to this particular matter is that Electric Ireland, the ESB&rsquo;s customer supply business, introduced a low-user standing charge on 1 February 2012.  The charge applies to that minority of customers who use an average of two units, 2kW, or less per day in any billing period, which is typically 61 days.  Standing charges will be increased by 15.5 cent, including VAT, per day or &euro;9.45, including VAT, per two-monthly bill.  Based on analysis of last year&rsquo;s consumption, Electric Ireland estimates between 130,000 to 175,000 customers, 10% to 13% of its existing customer base, may be affected.  The increased standing charge will not apply to customers who receive a free electricity allowance or those on household budget plans and pay-as-you-go meters.</P>
        <P>I would have been very concerned if it were the case that low-income households and vulnerable customers were to be affected by the standing charge increase.  I can tell Deputy Buttimer I have been assured by Electric Ireland that such customers will not be affected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  His response was balanced and beautifully delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea of a low-usage Electric Ireland customer changing to a new supplier is not a runner.  Is the Minister willing to suggest to the ESB that there are many other ways of saving the same amount of money without pegging it on the customer?  The simplest answers to this problem are to cut down on administration and get the customers in question to accept electronic billing.  There is no point in reading a meter that has no charges on it.  The ESB has known for years which low-use customers, such as those with holiday homes, are <Col N="61"/>involved because it has an averaging system to anticipate usage.  This charge and the reasons given by the ESB for it are unjustified.  Will the Minister ask the ESB to examine alternative ways to make savings which, with the co-operation of the customer, would cut down on administrative and meter-reading costs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and his commitment that low-income households and vulnerable customers would not be affected.  The ESB is trying to cod us all.  It is discouraging energy efficiency as this charge will penalise low energy usage which is contrary to the policy pursued by the Government and everyone else.</P>
        <P>There is a need to monitor the effect of the low-usage charge.  I hope the Minister, with the ESB, will assess who the charge affects and review the category of users who have exemptions with the need to re-examine this decision in the next several months.  I believe the ESB has changed its meter-reading process &mdash; it certainly has in Cork city &mdash; and is not reading them as often as it claims.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in his reply that low-income households and vulnerable customers would not be affected.  I hope the ESB will review this charge.</P>

	<P>I was merely explaining the background of the impact of deregulation to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, which he understands well.

I want to assure Deputy Buttimer that this is the information I have.</P>
        <P>If Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct that his is a more common sense approach to invigilating this and his billing system would make more sense, I am more than happy to bring it to the attention of the ESB.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Deputy Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to put on the record the enormous boost received by various community organisations in Longford and Westmeath as a result of dormant accounts funding.  While I realise the levels of new measures and programmes for disbursement from the fund are likely to remain low given current budgetary constraints, I believe it is important to highlight the importance of funding for community organisations such as RAPID.</P>
        <P>RAPID is aimed at improving the quality of life and the opportunities available to residents of communities in cities and towns and reduce the deprivations faced by residents of disadvantaged communities.  I take this opportunity to thank the RAPID co-ordinators in Westmeath and Westmeath County Council who have done tremendous work in this area.</P>
        <P>RAPID operates across the themes of community safety, anti-social behaviour, health, family support, environmental issues, youth, education, training and employment.  It has benefited the estates of Grange, Farran Raith&iacute;n, D&rsquo;Alton Park, Ennell and Michael&rsquo;s Park in Mullingar, as well as seven estates in Athlone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Groups such as the Mullingar Youth Cafe continue to look for funding through the dormant accounts fund.  Midlands Regional Youth Service is the lead agency supporting this project and the young people of Mullingar are working very hard for the progression of the cafe.  While five areas were identified under the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2009, Mullingar included, no actual moneys were provided in 2011.  Will the Minister do all he can to get resources for these projects?  I hope he will see a way to invest some of the funds into the original 46 RAPID areas as there has been no investment since 2008.  A sum of &euro;100,000 would go a long way in Athlone.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of this legislation is to reunite account holders and policy holders with their funds in credit institutions and insurance undertakings.  It further provides for a scheme of disbursement for charitable purposes or purposes of societal and community benefit of funds that are not likely to be reclaimed.</P>
        <P>I am confident that under the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, this objective will remain unchanged.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on his work.  I hope communities across the country will benefit from the money that will be forthcoming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on bringing it to us.  The Bill is another example of the reform being proposed by the coalition Government.  In his trend of reform, the Minister has already merged local authorities.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has merged VECs.  It is fulfilling the commitment in the programme for Government to make a substantial cut to the number of State bodies and companies.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy McGuinness, is present.  He will very much welcome the attempt to make Government smaller, more accountable and make it deliver to people.  That should be at the heart of Government.  It should not be about the creation of fiefdoms.  Deputy McGuinness was a long-time opponent of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, when he was in the House.  The model he employed could bear with close scrutiny.  It would make a great PhD study of how not to do business.  He made Government bigger and it became uncontrollable and unaccountable. <Col N="63"/> Fiefdoms and slush funds were created and money was poured out to keep everyone happy.  The fabric of society plummeted in the past 14 years.</P>
        <P>In our election manifesto we committed to cutting the number of quangos, regulators and inspectorates, and to end the confusion, wasteful mismanagement and fragmentation in the delivery of services.  Those of us involved in national politics with a local authority background fully understand that people and the delivery of service to them must be at the core of what we do.  I love the Irish phrase &ldquo;an gn&aacute;th duine&rdquo;.  That is what they are.  That is who depends on the service of Government.</P>
        <P>Deputy McFadden is correct.  RAPID was a very good proposal that brought enhanced benefit to communities.  The great phrase &ldquo;enhancement of the public realm&rdquo; became a reality for communities.  In Cork city we have a very good RAPID co-ordinator.  She does great work.  She is accountable.  She attends meetings and she delivers.  I am afraid that we have lost accountability in the fragmentation that is now the delivery of Government in different spheres and on different levels.  From tomorrow morning I hope we will not have a lack of accountability from those who remain following the public service retirement scheme and that they will not use the excuse of the diminishing numbers to bring it about.</P>
        <P>To date, the Government has abolished more than 14 quangos, two more are in the process of being abolished and 15 more are on a list for abolition.  A total of nine quangos are being merged and there are plans to merge six more.  Three quangos are being restructured and a further ten are due to be restructured.  In 12 months the Government has started its reform process.  I welcome the changes proposed in the Bill for the amalgamation of the dormant accounts fund.  It ends one period and introduces another.  The Minister and the Department will be to the fore in terms of expenditure, which will be under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of the Bill which I very much welcome is that the role of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in the disbursement of dormant accounts funding will be also increased.  The power to annul the scheme within 21 days will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That will allow for accountability, debate, discussion and transparency.  It also involves the political responsibility lying with the Minister, which was lacking for 14 years.  Ministers could hide behind quangos and say they had no responsibility, that it was not their job.  The Minister is doing that.  It is important that we have proper oversight of decisions being taken.</P>
        <P>The Bill is another example of a reforming Government, one that understands the need for accountability, and of a Minister who is prepared to accept responsibility and accountability.  As Deputy McFadden indicated, the RAPID programme has done great work, which must be continued.  We must continue to enhance the lives of our fellow citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill purely for the removal of the board.  I was concerned about the board and its inefficiencies.  It is our policy to remove quangos and this is a good example of a bad quango.  I approve of the way the money is to be disbursed to various groups, especially those whose aim is to ease poverty and alleviate social deprivation.</P>
        <P>I wish to examine the workings of the board.  I give the Minister a word of warning.  On a number of occasions in its annual reports the board has indicated that the disbursement of money could be bureaucratic and cumbersome within the various Departments.  The Minister should take on board the point.  When he disburses funds, by whatever means he chooses, he should remove the onerous task on groups seeking funding so that it is made as easy as possible for them to draw down funding.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline reasons for my delight that the Bill has come before the D&aacute;il and for the disbandment of the board.  A comment was made by the board in its 2010 report to the effect <Col N="64"/>that there were no inspectors of financial services to ensure it was complying with the terms of the 2001 Act.  I find it strange that a board would indicate its disquiet in 2010 that from 2003 to 2010 the Minister had not appointed an inspector.  Why did the board not question the situation previously?  Surely it was the responsibility of the board to ensure all necessary measures were in place to ensure the money coming to it for disbursement did so in a proper manner.</P>
        <P>I read the reports from 2009 and 2010.  I was struck by the ability of the board to reduce its costs by 50% between the 2009 report and the 2010 report.  It is interesting to note how when someone feels threatened, one is able to reduce one&rsquo;s costs to show how viable one is at a lower cost.  I do not understand the reason that was not done previously.</P>
        <P>The funny thing about the board is that it had four auditors.  Deloitte were the main auditors.  Goodbody Economic Consultants audited the audits.  Pobal carried out the audit for the Government and the Comptroller and Auditor General also carried out an audit.  That is unreal.  The Department of Health, which has a budget of approximately &euro;19 billion, does not have as many auditors.  The cost for such audits in 2009 amounted to &euro;124,000.  I was also annoyed when I checked the website for the 2010 report, which was laid before the D&aacute;il in August 2011.  It was not there.  I often wonder about such situations.  Why did the board not lay its annual report before the public?  When I clicked on the &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement to Date&rdquo; link on the home page, the site was blocked.  I could not find out where the money was going.  When I clicked on &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund Profile&rdquo;, it was blocked as well.  I am nervous that this could be a secret organisation that is unwilling to let the public know where the money is going.</P>
        <P>For this reason among other others, I am pleased the Minister has introduced this legislation, given the valid points I have made.  With the removal of the board, the Minister will take more control of the fund.  This is the key reason that I welcome the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to get the Acting Chairman back on track.</P>

Difficult as it sometimes is for people on this side of the House to credit the other side, the Dormant Accounts Fund was one of the previous Government&rsquo;s better initiatives.  Since examples of the large amount of valuable work it has done have been cited by other Deputies, I will not repeat them.  As someone who represents a largely working class constituency, I can testify to the volume of good work done thanks to the investment of the money in the community.  Its work has always been appreciated by local organisations and projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>I have a strong opinion that the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, might take on board concerning the criteria used when deciding on the status of a bank account, insurance policy, etc.  The timeframe is 15 years.  Given what we now know, this could be reduced to ten years.  This opinion, which I have held for some time, is based on discussions that were held in the House before the Acting Chairman and I became Members.</P>
        <P>Like other Deputies, I am glad that the board will be integrated into the Department.  This is the right approach and will lead to a saving.  Although &euro;200,000 is not a substantial saving to some, it is a valuable amount in the current climate, particularly given the hardships being suffered by some projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the amending legislation.  That any future structure must be published and laid before the House is good and transparent.  I have always viewed the Dormant Accounts Fund <Col N="65"/>as being unique, in that it is the only example of wealth sharing in Ireland.  It takes from a pot of money that comes from people who, as we all know, are usually better off than others.  I hope my next comment is taken in a humorous spirit.  The fund is the only opportunity for the less well-off to benefit from those who have more.  The irony is that most of the latter are dead and do not have any say in making the contribution but the money goes where it should.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill.  For those organisations that will benefit from the fund, this is a welcome amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on and support the Bill.  I commend the Minister on restructuring the board and giving the House a greater input into how the money is spent and how it is accounted for.  That is how it should be not just in respect of this board, but in terms of most boards.  The sooner we make the House relevant to their activities, the better it is for democracy and transparency.</P>
        <P>Deputy Buttimer has left the House but I thank him for his kind remarks.  As with the Deputy, I like the concept of small government and keeping government out of small business as much as is possible or practical.  The reform to which he referred was promised in the context of the general election and is welcome.  As we get on track, we can introduce similar reforms in other Departments.  If they work in favour of the public, transparency and accountability, the sooner we introduce legislation to commence that change, the better.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Buttimer referred to the past 14 years.  It is easy for the Government to point to the various failures of that time.  There are bound to be many failures in any 14-year period.  We know what they were.  However, we need to remember the positives, for example, the RAPID programme and the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The latter was positive, in that it spent and distributed moneys to communities.  Compared with lottery grants, the smaller amounts distributed by the fund had the greater effect in local communities.</P>
        <P>The last general election and the previous local government election brought to light the devastation in communities in my constituency.  A number of housing estates had grown marginalised.  In one estate in Kilkenny, the unemployment rate was 85%.  Central to this issue is the need for good community structures.  For example, a good family resource centre can make a significant difference.  A community centre in the old sense of the term can also make a significant difference.  Many of the family resource centres established in the past 14 years have made positive contributions and have expanded the range of services they provide to their communities.  This was made possible by tapping into national lottery grants initially and, more importantly, dormant accounts.</P>
        <P>It is not always the case that these accounts have been abandoned by rich people.  They are bank accounts that can be reclaimed through this scheme at any time, yet they are important in terms of their positive impact on local communities and services.  Given the pot of money that has built up in dormant accounts over the years, it might be no harm for the Minister of State to consider the question of the corporate responsibility of large companies and, to a certain degree, the issue of philanthropy.  Although most of the financial institutions are in serious difficulty, some continue to make profits and, along with individuals, may wish to contribute to society in some way.  This is a vehicle they could consider using for their contributions.  It is well managed and its funds make a positive impact by going directly to the individuals or organisations concerned.  It would be worthwhile to involve others in contributing to the dormant accounts fund.  If we want to be all-inclusive and citizen centred, those who are well off could be given an opportunity to contribute in this way.</P>
        <P>I commend those who have served on boards over the years and I do not refer to anyone personally when I say that the number of quangos has to be dramatically reduced.  If boards <Col N="66"/>are necessary, perhaps a single board should cover a range of activities.  I am sure that can be provided for legally.  The administration of a company could be undertaken through this single board as the quangos are abolished.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have 21 days to debate proposals made by the Minister.  I welcome the political commitment to bring decision making power back to this House.</P>
        <P>I agree with other speakers that the overly bureaucratic approach taken by Pobal needs to be challenged.  Guidelines need to be set out clearly so that the staff of that agency understand not only the need to examine, scrutinise and account for money, but also the need to be less bureaucratic with organisations that deliver within the community.  The removal of the board addresses some of the problems which the McCarthy report identified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a time of limited money, we need to focus as much as possible on communities that find themselves marginalised in some way.  We speak about reskilling and preparing individuals for employment but we must support communities that have experienced unemployment for generations.  The children of some families have not seen their parents, or even grandparents, at work for many years.  The Dormant Accounts Fund has supported a number of projects which have successfully broken the cycle.  We need to recreate that success in other areas that have been badly affected.  This is the only way we can restore individuals&rsquo; dignity and pride in their communities.  It will also help them to understand the need to build up their communities for the next generation so that the devastation inflicted on housing estates throughout the country can be repaired.</P>
        <P>In the past we looked to F&Aacute;S and other agencies to create social employment but the suggestions must now come from the communities themselves.  The dormant accounts fund enables us to do that.  We will have a greater chance of success if we look to the communities for the projects they want to champion instead of taking a top-down approach.  I have seen how successful the community approach can be in the RAPID areas of Kilkenny city.  Areas that were once vandalised have been put to positive use by the community.  I am familiar with individuals who managed to turn their lives around by participating in education schemes, family resource projects and community centres and are now making a positive contribution to their communities.  The focus has to be on rebuilding communities.  Anyone who read the book, <i>Bowling Alone</i>, will realise that the processes it describes are starting to reverse because people are becoming more interested in working together to find solutions to their own problems.</P>
        <P>I also hope funding will be provided to deal with the growing problem of drug abuse.  I never thought I would see families who are well respected in my parish devastated by heroin.  Drug abuse was previously associated with the bigger cities but it can now be found in most small urban settlements.  The response over the years has not been perfect.  Aislinn, which caters for the entire country from its base in Ballyragget in County Kilkenny, runs a deficit every year.  It has been hugely successful in using an American model to help individuals break the cycle of drink and drug abuse but at the end of the year it has to raise as much as &euro;100,000 to make ends meet.  The Government needs to step in to make it possible for organisations like Aislinn to apply for money to deal with the problem of drug abuse.  They should also be given the opportunity to apply for further funding to expand their services in order to deal with the problem before it grows further.  There is no funding available at present to deal with the next phase of the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Aislinn is an example of a successful organisation which has always encountered difficulty in raising the funds it requires.  The Dormant Accounts Fund could easily be activated to fund this project and others like it.  I appeal to the Minister to include sufficient flexibility in his plan <Col N="67"/>to cater for such projects.  Aislinn has grown out of the community in response to an extremely serious problem.  Drug abuse affects not only the individual with the habit, but also the next generation, the family unit and the community.  I have seen too much of it to ignore it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another area on which we should focus relates to the community.  It relates to youth affairs generally, activity around youth, the funding for those who fall out of the system and are not in education or are only partly in education and who are looking for an alternative means of participating in society and educating themselves and having a positive role.  I have mentioned the Fr. McGrath Centre in Kilkenny on numerous occasions.  It began as a family resource centre and then delivered a number of information and communications technology projects.  It allowed younger people within that marginalised community to skill themselves for school through the homework club, etc., and to become prepared to continue in school such that the majority of those are now completing their leaving certificate examinations which never happened there before.  That only became possible through the various grants the centre received from Government and particularly the occasional grant it received from the dormant accounts fund.</P>
        <P>While I have made criticism here, the work of Pobal has been positive and proves that the dormant account scheme works.  It has a record of funding projects that continue to be successful in their communities.  The Bill will not damage that and will make it more cost effective to do business.  I hope it will make it less bureaucratic to do business with Pobal and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It will give greater participation to the House in terms of the debate.  New and better ideas may emerge in the debate we will have on the plan.  In that reforming and inclusive way the Minister might consider the different proposals coming from all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>In terms of accountability, I note the outgoing board will make its report, which will come to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I look forward to seeing that report, particularly in the light of some of the criticism I have heard in this House concerning the availability of the report itself and regarding the numerous audits that the board seems to have put itself through at some cost.</P>
        <P>The general local government fund and any funding for local government should come under the remit of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There should be one auditor and every cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money should be subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General, including local government.  The Minister should consider that reform.  The Committee of Public Accounts has asked for it and I believe it is a step that could be taken very quickly in order to restore confidence in the system generally.  It would give greater accountability across the system.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General along with the Committee of Public Accounts are central to reporting to this House.  That is another essential reform at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay compliment to Deputy McGuinness because, as always, he speaks considerable sense and I agree with much of what he said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Colleagues have reflected on something that happened earlier today when the Taoiseach made an announcement in the House about the referendum.  It is important that more such announcements are made here in the Chamber so that Deputies here get an opportunity to be the first people to debate and discuss such very important issues.  Over the years we have seen ever more power, authority and responsibility being devolved from this Chamber and from Deputies elected by the people to unelected boards which in many cases are unaccountable or hard to get to account to the House and to the democratic process.  I am not saying that is the case with this particular board, which has done considerable good work.  One of the reasons for dissolving this board is that the fund has reduced.  When the Dormant Accounts Fund was <Col N="68"/>initially established, I felt it would be time limited because the money would run out after a while, which is what is happening now.</P>
        <P>However, we need to consider other issues.  The dormant accounts legislation enabled taking money from accounts that were unused for a number of years and put it at the disposal of the State.  As colleagues have said, considerable good has come from this and many communities have benefited, continue to benefit and will benefit into the future.  However, we must not forget that this money is not owned by the State.  The money legally belongs to account holders, who have the right to claim back the money in time.  I am not sure whether they can claim a refund on any interest that might have accrued.  Perhaps when the Minister is summing up he might clarify that point.</P>
        <P>In other jurisdictions great effort is put into trying to reunite owners of property with unclaimed property.  In the United States, for instance, every state has an unclaimed property agency.  Obviously, the United States is much bigger than Ireland and has considerably more wealth.  It makes considerable efforts to reunite unclaimed property with the rightful owners.  The financial institutions here have that responsibility.  Once that money transfers to the State here, how much effort is put into informing people that they might have money, property or wealth that is legally theirs and that they are entitled to claim it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy McGuinness alluded to the need to fight poverty.  I would go further than that and, as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, one of the issues about which I am concerned is the need to fight crime and more importantly to fight the causes of crime.  That is one thing the Dormant Accounts Fund can do and does.</P>
        <P>I bring to the attention of the House another method that might not be as fruitful now as it might have been a number of years ago when I first raised it.  This is the issue of escheatment, which relates to a state taking unclaimed dividends.  A person who receives a dividend cheque of &euro;2 or &euro;3 will often not bother cashing it.  Those moneys can lie in the accounts of corporations, banks and so on and eventually be claimed back into the bank or corporation.  In other countries the principle of escheatment is quite advanced and it could be considered here also.  Now that we are discussing dormant accounts we may need to consider broadening the ways of claiming properties that are lying idle.  I mentioned dividends, but other unclaimed funds exist.  This is a well-known procedure in the United States and to a lesser extent in other countries such as Australia, India and so on.  It is taken seriously in America and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has issued guidelines to US quoted companies on it.  It appears that all states have established escheatment laws based on underlying federal statutes.  Individual states are entitled to control the escheated assets belonging to residents or former residents of a particular state.  There is also a strict fines system where companies fail to comply with their filing obligations.  The definition of escheatable property is wide and not limited to quoted companies, but it includes any category of asset where the beneficial owner has either not received the funds or not claimed them.  That issue could be examined in the broader scheme of things.</P>
        <P>I know that the Minister is interested in philanthropy.  Although philanthropy in Ireland has grown rapidly in the past decade, it is still in its infancy and it will face severe headwinds in the coming years with the situation in the economy.  As in all countries, the non-profit sector is large and growing.  One count estimates that there are 24,000 voluntary organisations in Ireland, of which more than 7,500 are registered charities.  We must examine the charities sector as well.  I am keen to see a regulator appointed to the charities sector, which employs 63,000 people.  Obviously, the sector here is a good deal smaller than other countries such as the United States where there are more than 1 million public charities and where three out of four people donate.  I know the Minister is interested in encouraging philanthropy to bring out the <Col N="69"/>best in people.  Deputy McGuinness referred to this earlier.  We must build capacity and increase the level of skills of those working in the sector.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  We must begin to scrutinise other boards to establish whether we can downsize or amalgamate them.  Many boards are rather large and have many members.  I question why some of them are so large.  Now is possibly the time to amalgamate some of these boards, downsize them and give them more than one function if we decide to retain them.  It is important that responsibility and accountability is devolved to the House and, in particular, to the committees of the House because this is where real accountability lies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill.  The dormant accounts board originated from the DIRT inquiry and has raised hundreds of millions of euro.  It carried out very good work.  When I was Minister we decided this was one quango too many.  The dormant accounts board was set up because the usual allegations made about slush funds and so on were being made with regard to the possibility of the Government disbursing the fund.  Several years ago, we amended the Act and transferred the giving out of the funds from the independent board to the Department.  The board was in place as a general oversight body that drew up the dormant accounts plan.  However, the actual disbursement was an issue for the Government.  It is fine to have an independent board.  My complaint at the time, which in hindsight was a wise complaint, was that it was giving out far too much in current funding.  If one gives a two year project funding, after the two years is up the project will come with the hand out looking for a further two years and a further two years again.  A problem would then arise because one creates extra liabilities on the State.  We now know the danger of creating continuing liabilities on the State.</P>
        <P>I always took the view that the vast majority of dormant accounts funding should go to capital projects.  The reason we took that function away from the board was to ensure we had control over the fundamental issue of sustainability into the long term without Exchequer funding.  The categories involved included educational disadvantage, social and economic disadvantage and disability.  By their nature, few of these projects would become self-sustaining in a business manner.  Therefore, if one ran a programme that was good, either it would be required to get more dormant accounts funding, although it was not meant to be repeat dormant accounts funding, or one would have to move on to Exchequer funding.  We know now the consequences of ever increasing commitments of Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>In the first stage the Department moved to take over the disbursement.  Several committees were formed.  Pobal vetted the projects and brought them to the committees, several of which I chaired.  We examined the proposals from Pobal at these committees.  Often, if we were unsatisfied with a proposal to fund or to refuse funding we discussed it with the agencies involved and we asked them to revisit it.  By doing so we avoided what some Deputies might have been concerned about, that is, decisions made on the back of an envelope without proper evaluation.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, leaving it to the agency and not having a committee and a political input would have thrown up significant difficulties as well.  I remember one case where a project came for a respite building.  It was a flagship project and half the money for it was to come from the community involved through flag days and genuine non-State resources.  They sought to build a respite centre for people with mental disabilities.  Pobal recommended refusal on the grounds that there was no clear demand for the respite centre stated on the application form.  The only reason it was not stated was that it was so obvious that the promoters, a well-known body involved in disability, figured they did not need to make the case too strongly.  The HSE was at the committee and its view was that it should be funded.  A reasonable suggestion was agreed to the effect that Pobal would reinvestigate whether the services would be used and <Col N="70"/>whether there would be a demand for them.  They have been used since then and there is always a demand when it comes to people with disabilities.  We were providing a building that would be considerably more efficient and built to a higher standard than what was in place previously.</P>
        <P>There were few complaints during my time as Minister in terms of the process of giving out the money.  When the debate started about the quangos we decided that the oversight should be in this House, just as Deputy Stanton has suggested.  I am not in favour of the idea we sometimes throw out among each other that the last people we trust are each other.  That has done no one on any side of the House any service.  It is easy to check every step that every Minister carries out in the disbursement of money through the freedom of information process.  If one believes it is unfair, there are many committees for oversight.</P>
        <P>Over the years all of us have gone to Ministers on the other side of the House to speak for a good project.  When I was a Minister, if anyone came to me on that basis, I would have taken it into account.  If something was recommended for refusal, I would sometimes check with the local Deputies whether they thought it was a right or wrong decision.  We bring a knowledge which is incomparable because we are all on the ground.  This is especially the case if we are willing to be somewhat interparty about these issues in our consultations to reinforce whether we are making the right decisions.</P>
        <P>The board has been magnificent.  It has done its job thoroughly with great efficiency and at very low cost.  I would particularly like to thank Mr. Michael Morley, the chairman of the board, who has been one of the best chairpersons of any State board.  He brought to the board a wealth of skill and knowledge about money from his professional life, but also brought a wealth of knowledge about the community sector because of his involvement in the community.  It was difficult to get somebody skilled in both of those spheres.  The rest of the board also put in significant time.</P>
        <P>At a time people were complaining about there being 400 quangos and despite the fact nobody could complain about the work of the board, it was our view that the board was superfluous to need and that there was no need for a statutory board to do the work that remained, because the plan was simple and focused.  Another factor is that the amount of money coming in now is much less than previously.  I understand that last year some &euro;38 million came in and that half of that is going out again.  Therefore, the account has approximately &euro;20 million a year to disburse.</P>
        <P>This leads to the next issue with which we must deal, and I hope the Minister will arrange for this to be taken on board in an amendment.  I was working on this issue when I was Minister.  I recall the first time I went over to the Department of Finance.  Money was going out, but money was coming in from a non-Exchequer source in accrual at the bottom of the Estimates.  Therefore, there was no net expenditure.  I asked whether we could increase the spend and was told we could not, because all of the dormant account money was considered a liability.  This is farcical, considering that in ten years of getting in this money, the outgoing has never exceeded what comes into the account.  It is farcical that all of the money coming into the account, some of it from as far back as 1800 and something &mdash; which was unclaimed in the banks &mdash; is considered to be a liability on the State.</P>
        <P>This is ridiculous.  We suggest the State could have a windfall profit or reduction of its debt of approximately &euro;400 million tomorrow if it came to an agreement on this.  It could say that anybody who put money into a bank and suddenly remembered the money was there, was entitled to repayment, which is in fact the case, and that these people would have the first call on the money that comes in this year.  It could say that if by some freak circumstance the <Col N="71"/>amount of money being reclaimed was greater than what was coming into the account, which has never been the case, these people could have the first call on the dormant account money coming in the following year.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Stanton, I do not understand how &euro;30 million a year continues to come into the account.  I have suspicions of how these bank accounts arise, but I can dream on because I do not know for certain, since nobody showed me the bank accounts in question.  However, the money keeps rolling in.  Therefore, it seems reasonable that the State could say its liability to the big fund is wiped away, despite the fact that people are entitled to repayment of their money.  People who are due reclaims can get their money from the bank in the normal way before their accounts becomes dormant, because the bank is meant to contact people a number of times before declaring their accounts dormant.  If after their accounts are declared dormant, people suddenly remember their money, they would have first call on the money coming in from dormant accounts before it is disbursed through the dormant accounts fund.</P>
        <P>If the Minister feels this is too radical, he could provide for a reserve fund in the dormant accounts or could decide to reserve money for another five years and keep those moneys parked and frozen for possible repayment.  I do not believe anybody would ever draw from that reserve fund, but if it were a concern, the Minister could make that arrangement to be doubly sure there would not be a risk of somebody not being repaid his or her money.  The idea that all the people who ever had a dormant account would come in claiming all this money is beyond reason.  We know the banks have written off coinage and notes over the years that got lost from people&rsquo;s pockets, fell down drains or whatever and that this came as a windfall profit to the State and the Exchequer.  We know that can be done, although technically that money could be found and reclaimed.  However, everybody knows that is not going to happen, although if people find some old legal tender, they can take it to the Central Bank and get money for it.  Common sense in this regard could save the Government significant money.  Now more than ever, it would be good to free up this dormant account money so that the Department of Finance need not argue that if it gives out &euro;20 million from the dormant accounts fund this year, that is a &euro;20 million liability for the State.  If it wrote off all of the fund, apart from the incoming moneys and the money put aside as a reserve, it would still have considerable money to spend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suggest this money should be spent in two ways.  First, it should be spent on flagship projects.  Flagship projects are for educational, social and economic disadvantage and for disability, and all funding provided should be capital funding only, which was my intention when this fund was set up.  Providing money for flagship project allows the Government to provide that if a community can, for example, collect &euro;250,000 for a project, it can then apply to the dormant accounts fund for that same amount.  Whatever the community collected, it could collect the same again from the account.  We insisted that none of the funding for these flagship projects could be State funding.  In other words it could not be HSE funding or whatever or the Government would not match it.  It should be genuine private funding.</P>
        <P>We found that much of the funds raised by communities came to disability groups, who constantly collect money.  They are fantastic at collecting money and love the idea of doubling their money for a project they have in mind.  Funding for a  particular project in Limerick came from a philanthropist well known to many people.  Fantastic facilities have been built as a result of this method of fund-raising.  People collecting funds could say to the people they were asking to put money in their boxes that for every euro they succeeded in collecting, they would get another euro to back it.  That is a huge stimulus to encourage people to give.  Despite the downturn in the economy, it is extraordinary how willing people are to give money.  I heard recently about a fund-raising effort for a hospital after a young child died in Connemara.  A day was spent fund-raising with a sponsored cycle and walk and a sum of approximately &euro;30,000 <Col N="72"/>was raised.  That was raised in one day.  There are people who will give and all of us know that.  Despite hard times, these people are more than willing to give.  However, it is a real incentive to people to give if they are told the money collected will be doubled.  It would be worth the Minister&rsquo;s while to look at the list of projects that were done by this method.</P>
        <P>The Minister should focus &mdash; I would do this if I were Minister &mdash; on using dormant accounts funding every year to provide discretionary funding to the RAPID areas for small projects.  The RAPID areas are the most socially and economically deprived areas in this country and by definition fall into the category of what is eligible for dormant account funding.  I found that when I provided &euro;100,000 funding to Pobal for RAPID areas, Pobal went and decided to give that money out to small projects within these disadvantaged areas.  It might have provided funding just for a set of uniforms for a band or equipment for a sports club, but the money made a great difference to the lives of people, particularly young people on whom funding was focused.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It gave people a sense of ownership of RAPID.  There was a point in going to RAPID committee meetings because there was something to do, such as a firm decision to make.  It was not just about co-ordinating Government agencies.  By providing &euro;5,000 here or &euro;2,000 there, one could help all the small projects that find it hard to raise money in these areas.  I have noticed that something makes it easier to collect money for causes &mdash; football clubs, etc. &mdash; in rural areas of the county.  It is much harder to get financial support in deprived urban areas.  The approach we were taking was not costing us a huge amount of money.  It would be worthwhile for the Government to consider adopting this approach again.</P>
        <P>This Bill will have to be passed in order to do all of what I have said.  That is fine.  The board does not change what I am talking about.  The liability issue will have to be dealt with if it is to be possible to start giving out the money again.  In my view, it is more of a mental block than a real block.  After that has been dealt with, the Government should decide to use this funding in areas of social and economic disadvantage, rather than dispersing it in a scattergun manner throughout the country.  As we did previously, we should focus the funds mainly on the RAPID programme.  The rest of it should be allocated through another flagship scheme for capital projects.  This will suit the disability groups, in particular.  Half of the money will come from box-shaking or philanthropy and the other half will come from the dormant accounts.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  More than at any other time, we need to be creative now.  We should work together in the interests of people.  I hope the amendments we will propose will be accepted in that spirit.  If the wording of an amendment is not right on Committee Stage &mdash; it never is when one is in opposition &mdash; perhaps the Government will come forward with an equivalent amendment to deal with these issues.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Before Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v leaves the Chamber, I would like to say I agree with much of what he has said.  While we might have our differences on the disposal of effluent and sewage, I agree with almost everything he has said on this occasion.  I know he speaks with much experience in this area.  It is obvious that he enjoyed his time in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  He probably has some unfinished business in this respect.  I acknowledge the work he did on this matter when he was a Minister.  It would be for him to take a potshot for the sake of it.  I am sure he is keen to go for his spuds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The points made by Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Stanton on the role of the Oireachtas in the distribution of public funds are important.  I have said previously that we could be abolishing this country&rsquo;s quangos at a much faster rate.  We need to dissolve many quangos quickly.  We should restore to the Oireachtas the powers that were given to it when it was originally established, including the power to levy taxes and distribute funds.  It is difficult to explain the role of an elected representative to people.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was right when he suggested that Deputies on all sides of the House approach Ministers of all parties to look for the best deals they can get for their constituencies.  That is our prerogative and our entitlement.  We are put in here to get the best possible deals for our constituencies.  To that end, we approach those Ministers who have discretion over certain aspects of funding.  When a Minister reports to the House by placing on the public record a memorandum of how he or she has distributed funds, he or she can be questioned on that at an Oireachtas committee or on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  When that accounting factor is removed from elected representatives, the role of the Oireachtas is diluted and, in a sense, some democracy is removed from the system.  It is a way of taking a step away from those who have ultimate responsibility for the dispersal of public moneys &mdash; the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The initiative being taken by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in removing a layer of quangos from the system must be recognised as a good thing.  Nobody wants to cast an aspersion on the previous board.  Although I do not know the members of that board, I am sure they did a good job.  Everyone who spoke before me acknowledged the role of the board.  I suppose it would be unfair of me not to thank it for the role it played.  It is important to bear in mind that this is just one Bill.  It is unfortunate that legislation is required to abolish this board.  It would be better if it could be done faster and more efficiently.  Having said that, I hope the Bill before the House will be passed speedily.</P>
        <P>I recently attended a meeting at which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government demonstrated that a multiplicity of boards, project teams, groups, organisations and companies limited by guarantee are being funded by one agency or Department or another.  It is really a spider&rsquo;s web.  To be honest, we need to reduce the plethora of quangos much more quickly.  Much more legislation needs to come before the House to abolish these quangos and restore the central role of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is supposed to be responsible for these matters in the first instance.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was right to say that any decisions on the distribution of funding will ultimately rest with the Minister.  I suggest that the Oireachtas committees have an enhanced role in this regard.  There is a danger that the committees will become talking shops.  Ministers are dismantling the layers of quangos and talking shops.  I think they should take suggestions on board before they present their findings to the committees.</P>
        <P>I have a personal interest in the RAPID programme, which was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Before the previous Government left office, it identified Rathkeale, County Limerick, as one of the towns that would benefit from the programme.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was right to point to the educational, social and cultural benefits of the RAPID programme in addressing disadvantage and helping people with disabilities.  I will give the House an indication of the types of projects that were identified by the group that came together to promote the programme in Rathkeale.  They identified that funding was required by the boxing club, the scouts, the community centre, the local GAA club, the youth caf&eacute; and the community cr&egrave;che.  Anybody who is familiar with the demographics of Rathkeale will know it is unique in the sense that a large percentage of its population are members of the Traveller community.  They live cheek by jowl with the members of the settled community as they go about their daily lives.  Since I was elected to this House, I have had many positive engagements with the community council and <Col N="74"/>community representatives in Rathkeale.  The common objective of people from both communities is the advancement of the town.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was right when he said it is often much easier to collect money in rural areas than in disadvantaged urban areas.  There was a false dawn in Rathkeale recently when a circular somehow managed to get out from the Department.  It did not relate to Rathkeale alone.  It suggested that towns with identified projects would be able to avail of a &euro;100,000 grant.  For some reason, that did not transpire.  I would like to echo Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s sentiments in one respect.  When the next tranche of funding is made available, I ask the Minister to consider towns that are stuck in a logjam on the RAPID conveyor belt as they wait for funding to be approved.  Rather than opening the programme to other plausible and worthy projects, the most recent set of projects that were identified and approved by the Department should be approved for funding in the first instance.  In other words, that towns like Rathkeale and Ballina in County Mayo and other such places, would be the first towns to benefit from this funding.  I am somewhat surprised that this source of funding is continuing.  The Department and the individual banks will endeavour to identify the source of these dormant accounts but be that as it may, they are a welcome source of funding.  I refer to the late Jim Mitchell, God be good to him, and the legacy of his report of the DIRT inquiry which resulted in this source of funding for legitimate projects which are tackling social or economic disadvantage or projects in the disability sector.  The advantage of this funding is that it is outside mainstream departmental funding and it is helping projects which are worthy but for which there would not be mainstream funding available.  In an ideal world these projects would be funded without question but we are constrained by economic problems and such projects are of necessity put on the back burner.  Therefore, this source of funding is much appreciated but it needs to be channelled at a faster rate.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the notion of matching funding.  I have first-hand knowledge of rural communities in particular and there is no shortage of people prepared to put shoulders to the wheel when the call is made.  If matching departmental, RAPID or dormant accounts funding is available, those communities will not be found wanting.  In my constituency I can cite hundreds of examples of people who have sold raffle tickets and undertaken sponsored walks, for example, to make up the matching funding for projects.</P>
        <P>It is no secret that in my constituency we are very fortunate to have somebody of the character of JP McManus who has done a tremendous amount of work for the voluntary and charity sector in County Limerick and further afield, but specifically in his own county of Limerick.  We are fortunate to have a philanthropist of his stature prepared to lead very good projects which are desperately needed in communities across Limerick city and county and for which he deserves much credit.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank him on behalf of everybody who has availed of a service in which he has been directly or indirectly involved.  Philanthropy is regarded as a buzzword for corporate or banking institutions who are taking a new-found interest in their communities but in County Limerick, long before the word &ldquo;philanthropy&rdquo; came into the lexicon of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or anywhere else, we had somebody of the calibre of JP McManus who was always there when the local community needed him and for this we can be very grateful.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Department and I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, the need for this funding to be used where it could make a real difference, which is in the town of Rathkeale.  I may be labouring the point but I implore the Minister of State in the strongest terms to make the town a priority.  There is no other town in the country that can compare to it in terms of its social fabric.  Equally, there is no other town in the country that could compare to it in terms of the community spirit and community involvement and the get-up-and-go atti<Col N="75"/>tude of its people and the various groups who are busy, night after night, working with the young people, people on the margins of society, the elderly or those with a disability.  Funding under the RAPID programme was announced by the previous Government but this announcement was revoked.  The people need certainty and I implore the Minister of State to do something for them during the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>It is projected that there will be a saving of &euro;1.7 million following the abolition of the board and the transfer of powers to the Minister.  This is a starting point and other Departments and Ministers need to start looking into their own filing cabinets and introducing legislation to abolish a few quangos.  The country has a massive budget deficit and people are expecting to see more change but they are also expecting to see the Houses of the Oireachtas functioning for the purpose for which we are all elected, to be accountable for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  This Bill is one aspect of that responsibility.  Every Department contains an agency with responsibility for spending public moneys but which is not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, as a Minister would be.  Such bodies are invariably asked to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain what went wrong.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill which allows for money to be used but there needs to be a greater level of involvement.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it would be marvellous if these arrangements could be depoliticised.  For example, there should be an opportunity for all Deputies, from all sides of the House, to bring forward their ideas in respect of their own constituencies or of particular projects or interests.  This should not be confined to the dormant accounts.  Former Ministers with responsibility for sport gave out State moneys like snuff at a wake and used it almost as a personal fund to ensure their party was re-elected into government.  This left a sour taste in the mouths of many people.  The day the line Minister with responsibility for expenditure gives the House an account of his decisions will be a day to be commended.</P>
        <P>The dormant accounts fund is decreasing but a stream of money is still coming in so plans need to be in place constantly and those projects which have been stalled need to be given priority.  I refer to the role of Pobal in this disbursement of funds.  Pobal and the local authorities need to be involved in the process because if the board is dissolved, it is important to use these bodies to find out where this funding should be allocated.  I refer to the role of the Oireachtas which is paramount.  The presentation to a committee and, ultimately, to the House, of a report both before and after the allocation of funding is very important.</P>
        <P>This is a good piece of legislation which will enhance the communities which it is designed to serve, those which are most disadvantaged.  Once again I make a special plea for the town of Rathkeale in west Limerick which was promised funding on two occasions and unfortunately it has hit a road block in this regard.  I implore the Minister of State to impress on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the importance of delivering to that town and the need to show that town, its community council, its local representatives and its people that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, is behind it and that it acknowledges the work of organisations such as West Limerick Resources and Limerick County Council, in trying to bridge the difficulties.  I ask the Department to acknowledge the work of the community in enhancing their locality and in building a social infrastructure which will benefit future generations.  Everybody in Rathkeale would welcome this acknowledgement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the previous speakers.  Before I came to the Chamber I listened to the contributions on my office monitor and many valuable points were made by other speakers in this debate.  I thank the Technical Group for allowing me the facility of using some of their time to speak on this very important Bill.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>It would be remiss of any of us when talking about the dissolution of a board such as this not to acknowledge and thank the members of the board who have served over the years since its establishment in January 2006.  We must thank politicians on all sides of the House who worked to ensure the board was set up to distribute these funds and to raise the whole concept of using the money because the funny thing about money is that it is worth nothing unless it is put to use.  Having money lying in dormant bank accounts year after year was sinful when it could be put to good use and I compliment the uses to which it has been put.  Many projects, some of which have been referred to this evening, have benefited greatly from this unused money.</P>
        <P>Not too many people have come rushing to claim back their money, even though the facility is there and will be kept.  If anybody comes along and says it is his or her money, he or she will get it.</P>
        <P>We are not dealing with a bottomless pit and it will eventually come to an end but now more than ever, we must ensure the money is put to good use.  I have every confidence in the Minister and in the political system to ensure the money will be put to good use.  Having said that, the situation has changed a lot.  When the Dormant Accounts Board was set up in 2006, Ireland was a completely different place.  We were led to believe everybody had plenty of money and the gravy train would roll on but now we must be ever more prudent, shrewd and careful in the distribution of this money.  As we all know the austerity measures are hitting home in a real and hard way.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about where the money will go.  I respect the previous speaker who made a pitch for an individual case as he had every right to do.  No doubt he was making a very valid case for a place about which I know a lot because I used to go through it every Friday and Sunday on my way to Pallaskenry many years ago.</P>
        <P>When it comes to the spend, we must adopt a bottom up approach, about which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v already spoke.  He stated that community groups, in particular in rural areas, are excellent at raising funds, especially if they believe they will get matching funding.  If people believe the money they raise for a club or whatever will be doubled, it really gives them an incentive.</P>
        <P>A report over the weekend stated that 68,000 jobs could possibly be lost in the community and voluntary sector because of the austerity measures and the cutbacks in funding.  The type of work being done in our communities, which was not done before &mdash; for example, cr&egrave;ches, day care centres, before and after school clubs, tidy town committees, care of the elderly, dealing with issues of crime and rural transport &mdash; benefited from funding.  Funding is drying up and the Government is introducing cutbacks which are really starting to hit home.  We must be ever more vigilant in ensuring we get value for every euro spent from the dormant accounts fund.</P>
        <P>Money may have to be spent in ways we might not like.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to capital projects &mdash; in other words, not using the money for the day-to-day running of services.  If the money must be used for the day-to-day running of services which perhaps might otherwise close, it is important the Minister takes a hands on approach and says that he might not like using the money in this way but that if he does not have any other choice and if it is available to him, that is what he will do.  I am sure the Government would get support from all sides of the House in taking such a decision.  It is not ideal but we are not living in an ideal world.  Things are not normal at present and they will not be normal for a long time.  Ministers might find themselves having to do things which are not ideal.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome today&rsquo;s announcement on rural transport made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  It must be teased out further as there are aspects of what he proposes <Col N="77"/>which are not yet clear but broadly speaking, the Government seems to be tackling an issue which I raised before Christmas with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  I stated that some action would have to be taken in regard to transport in rural Ireland.  He responded positively at the time and the Government has acted on it in that there is now talk of a hackney service being made available in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I am not straying off the point of this Bill but am trying to tie the two together.  In the disbursement of the funds, if it was deemed necessary that some of these funds should be used for rural transport, that would not be ideal or what we might like to use the money for but, in the absence of other funding, if it would help to keep rural Ireland alive and vibrant and if it would help elderly people living in rural locations, it is something we would all very much support.</P>
        <P>There is social deprivation in rural Ireland because of a number of issues.  Elderly bachelors are staying at home and are not going out.  The reason they are not going out is because of changes to drink driving laws.  It has publicly been stated that it is leading to suicides.  This matter has been discussed even by county coroners.  In County Kerry, our coroner stated in recent times that he believes this type of social isolation is leading to elderly people committing suicide, which is unusual.</P>
        <P>Given the austerity measures, the Government may find that some of the dormant accounts money should be used for things such as the rural transport initiative, on which I complimented the Government.  It was announced today by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, and I welcome it.  It is a move in the right direction but the Government should not be afraid to use some of the dormant accounts money for rural transport if it would help people living in rural areas.</P>

        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />accepts that the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, chaired by Mr. Colm McCarthy, did not provide adequate analysis or evidence to support its recommendations to privatise State owned assets and enterprises;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that the sale of strategic successful self-financing commercial semi-State assets is not in the public interest;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further recognises that Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB have invested heavily in first world energy infrastructure across the island of Ireland, having the effect of safeguarding the State&rsquo;s energy security, creating tens of thousands of sustainable jobs and benefitting hundreds of thousands of families over the decades;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />agrees that retaining the State&rsquo;s 25% share in Aer Lingus is vital to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity to Europe, the US, and the rest of the world, and that guaranteeing the future of the airline&rsquo;s Heathrow slots by this retention is of strategic importance;</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further agrees that Coillte is an important rural employer, particularly at the current time, and that the sale of the company&rsquo;s harvesting rights and any failure by the State and the company to develop the massive potential of the forestry sector for timber production, biomass and eco-tourism will be detrimental to the public interest;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />accepts that using the proceeds from the sale of State assets for bank debt reduction will not relieve the State&rsquo;s national debt;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further accepts that the sale of State assets is a short-term measure that will have detrimental long-term economic, social and environmental costs;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the potential economic, social and environmental benefits of commercial semi-State companies have not yet been fully realised;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further notes the avoidable damage to the economy and disruption in services for consumers arising from industrial unrest resultant solely from the unnecessary sale of strategic State assets;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />mandates the Government to replace NewERA with a semi-State strategy group to include chief executive officers from each of the commercial semi-State companies, with responsibility for delivering a strategic job creation and training project, working directly with the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton and Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and reporting directly to the Taoiseach and the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />instructs that all annual dividends paid to the State by commercial semi-State companies must be reinvested into employment activation and training measures as identified by the semi-State strategy group and approved by the Taoiseach, reporting to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />rejects the Government&rsquo;s decision to sell State assets.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I propose to share time with Deputies Brian Stanley, Se&aacute;n Crowe, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Michael Colreavy and Dessie Ellis.  As the text of our motion states, we do not accept that the proposed sale of State assets announced last week by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is in the public interest, nor do we accept that selling off such assets in order to pay off the bank debt is justifiable.  Apart from the fact that it involves selling off part of public companies that have been built over many decades, it represents a waste of that money, given that it will mainly be used not for any productive purpose but to pay off the gambling debts of people to whom we owe nothing or, rather, to whom we ought to owe nothing and would owe nothing had those massive debts not been foolishly taken on as part of the State&rsquo;s sovereign debt.</P>
        <P>The fact that the vast bulk of the proceeds of the asset sales will go to pay that debt also exposes the spin that has been coming from the Government benches during and since the election.  We were assured by one of the parties opposite during that election that there would be no sell-off of State assets at all.  In fairness, Fine Gael said privatisation would be on the cards but denied it would be part of addressing the bank debt problem.</P>
        <P>In the programme for Government, Labour swallowed its pride, not for the first time, and accepted a commitment to selling off &euro;2 billion in value of State assets.  We were assured that <Col N="79"/>no strategic assets would be sold off and that all of the proceeds would go towards job creation through public investment.  We now realise how much those commitments were worth.  Some of those opposite who are now Labour Party Ministers had even spoken about Bord G&aacute;is as the jewel in the crown of the State sector.  Seemingly, that jewel is to be broken apart, with the shiniest part sold to privateers who will have the privilege of selling gas and electricity to the consumer without having any responsibility for the gas or electricity networks.</P>
        <P>After the massive investment in Bord G&aacute;is, companies that had no part of that will be able to come in and cherry pick the most profitable parts but leave the State with responsibility for the supply side.  Someone likened this to a person arriving to a market gardener and offering him or her the price of the seeds planted months before in return for being able to sell the ripe produce at full price.  Surely only a fool would agree to such a bargain and yet that is exactly what this Government is proposing to do.  Perhaps that is worth the pat on the head it received yesterday from the IMF, which specifically referred to the proposed sell-off.</P>
        <P>However, it is also clear that while the IMF has promoted privatisation in other states where it has intervened, including Greece, where it insisted on a higher target for asset sales than originally agreed, there is ideological support for privatisation within the Government.  That was already clear from the Fine Gael manifesto and that party is happy to go along with the similarly ideologically motivated agenda driven by Mr. Colm McCarthy who, despite having been commissioned by the former Government, has seen his report by and large accepted by the current Government.</P>
        <P>While Fine Gael is consistent in this, it raises enormous questions regarding the Labour Party and its long-standing alleged commitment to the public sector.  There was universal condemnation last week of the proposed sell-off by the trade union movement.  Jack O&rsquo;Connor of SIPTU described it as a tragedy for the Labour Party.  I am sure he will excuse some of us for not feeling that is the worse aspect of it.  More than that, it is going to be a tragedy for the country.</P>
        <P>I trust also, that in the light of the Labour Party&rsquo;s betrayal of one of its alleged core principles &mdash; there cannot be many left now other than self-preservation &mdash; that we will not have the new or old Liberty Hall festooned for the next election with Labour Party election propaganda, or the pages of <i>Liberty</i> given over to the promotion Labour Party candidates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps the most telling aspect of the announcement last week by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was the huge about-turn on the scale of the sale of State assets and the use of the proceeds of such a sale.  A target of &euro;2 billion was set in the programme for Government with a commitment to use it to finance a public jobs creation programme including the establishment of NewERA, the merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  Now we have been informed that the target has increased to &euro;3 billion and that only one third will go towards the promised public investment programme and &euro;2 billion towards the payment of bank debt.  It is a climb-down, to say the least.</P>
        <P>Both parties have reneged on their firm commitment before, during and after the election last year not to sell off any part of the State forestry agency, Coillte . Now they have decided to sell as yet unspecified parts of Coillte although we were assured last week this will not include the land under Coillte&rsquo;s control.  Given that we were previously told that no part of Coillte would be sold off, we may be pardoned for taking that with a grain of salt.  Suffice it to say, selling the Coillte forestry or land would be a betrayal of a valuable national asset, albeit one that, in common with other natural resources, has been underdeveloped over the history of this State.</P>
        <P>If the State harvests the crop, no grants are available for the State to reinvest.  If forestry is sold to developers or outside interests, what happens the land afterwards?  Do they take it for a term or continue to replant it?  These questions must be answered.  I highlight the clear <Col N="80"/>interest of several major corporations in acquiring Coillte in whole or in part.  Central to that was the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in his new role as chairperson of the International Forestry Fund and its relationship to Helvetia Wealth, which expressed an interest in Coillte.  Mr. Ahern also visited China in that connection so perhaps, in responding, the Minister might indicate whether the sale of Coillte forestry or assets arose in discussions with members of the Chinese delegation that visited this country two weeks ago.</P>
        <P>We know that the Chinese Investment Corporation had expressed an interest in acquiring Coillte assets.  It would be interesting to know whether, when having time off from visiting castles and Croke Park, members of the delegation discussed with Irish officials the possible acquisition of the State assets the Government is planning to sell.  Were the Chinese made aware of this and will the Minister indicate what discussions took place regarding the sale of State assets?  It would surely be ironic if Irish State assets were to be sold to the Chinese state so I await the Minister&rsquo;s response with interest.</P>
        <P>I urge Labour Party Members who are clearly dissatisfied with Government policy on this issue to vote in favour of the motion.  Despite their pessimistic outlook on the decline in and composition of the working class support, there must surely be some left who expect Labour not to go along with the sale of the crown jewels.  For Labour Party backbenchers to vote against this motion is a betrayal of workers in State companies, who had been promised so fervently in the past by current Labour Ministers and the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  This debate comes at a time when the Government plans to sell off strategic State assets.  We only have to look into the not too distant past to see history repeating itself.  Eircom, the State communications company, was worth &euro;8.4 billion at the time of its privatisation.  It was hived off amid huge controversy and now the company has a net value of just &euro;39 million.  Between 1982 and 1986 it received huge State investment.  The Minister&rsquo;s party was in power and I compliment him on what happened to Eircom in that period.  One of the good things that happened in the Government of the middle 1980s was the development of the telecommunications system, which improved massively under the watch of that Government.  Through this investment and the commitment of its employees, this State went from being 20 or 40 years behind our neighbours to being one of the leaders in telecommunications.  Having sold off the State-owned Eircom, download speeds available in Ireland remain below the fastest speeds available to customers in other OECD countries. </P>
        <P>While progress is being made in improving the cost and availability of basic broadband, Ireland is lagging three to five years behind competitor countries in terms of rolling out basic infrastructure capable of high speed next generation broadband.  Yet, this Government is attempting to do the same thing again to several of the State&rsquo;s prized assets.  The Government announced on 22 February, outside the Chamber, its proposal to sell off State assets worth in the region of &euro;3 billion.  This would occur despite the Labour Party&rsquo;s election manifesto which states: &ldquo;Labour is opposed to short termist privatisation of key state assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks.&rdquo;  Such a quick and brazen U-turn has not been seen for many a long year.</P>
        <P>The pro-public enterprise manifesto of the Labour Party was the basis for its election victory just over a year ago and laid the basis for its negotiations with Fine Gael, which in turn led to the coalition in government today.   It is a coalition that has overseen a catalogue of cuts.  I expect a chorus of lectures from Labour Party Minsters and backbenchers about our position.  They will be finger wagging at us, telling us to get real.  It will explain in pompous tones about how the country was run into the ground by Fianna F&aacute;il, it now has to pick up the pieces and how the whole show is really run by the troika.  If it honestly believes all that is true then the <Col N="81"/>Minister should resign.  If he has no power to protect the best interests of the people who elected him, then he should call it a day and step down.  Let people with real commitment and ambition for the country take over.</P>
        <P>We are not alone in our opposition to the sale of State assets.  SIPTU leader Jack O&rsquo;Connor, who is a member of the Labour Party executive, I understand, said: &ldquo;The announcement regarding the sale of some public enterprises is a sad day for the Irish people and a tragedy for the Labour Party.&rdquo;  Jimmy Kelly, regional secretary for UNITE, which is affiliated to the Labour Party said: &ldquo;As things stand today any sale will be opposed using every means at our disposal.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, IMPACT has also added its voice to the opposition to the scandalous sale of Coillte and other semi-State companies.  Far from being an isolated voice in the wilderness, Sinn F&eacute;in is very much in touch with the sentiment of working people and the Labour movement, and is in very good company in opposing the sale of State assets.</P>
        <P>Despite the limited fiscal powers Sinn F&eacute;in has in the North and the fact it is one of four parties in government which obviously involves compromise, as we all recognise, it has delivered on a wide variety of socioeconomic commitments.  These include the delivery of 8,000 social and affordable homes; aid for small and medium enterprises through a &pound;50 million loan fund; providing &pound;40 million to address dereliction and promote investment in deprived inner city areas; a &pound;13 million package to tackle rural poverty and isolation; continuing to work with others, including an SDLP Minister, on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35% by 2025; an investment of &pound;40 million to improve pathways to employment and improved community services; and implementing an integrated and affordable child care package with an additional &pound;12 million.  All of that is being done while the Tory Government reduces the block grant by &pound;4 billion.  This clearly shows there is a different and better way.  It can only be led by people who have vision and courage.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has a very different view from this Government on how the economy should be run.  In our pre-budget submission we detailed how semi-State companies should be used as a driver for economic recovery.  Coillte, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, which this Government intends to sell off, paid a total of &euro;1.97 billion to the State in dividends over the past ten years.  This is a huge success, by any standards, not to mention the PRSI and tax paid by workers and companies.  These dividends will be no more if Government proceeds with its proposals.</P>
        <P>Our proposals are simple, clear and focused on benefiting the country and its people.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the replacement of NewERA with a semi-State strategy group.   We are proposing alternatives. The Minister is fair-minded and might take some of our proposals on board.  The group we propose would include CEOs from semi-State companies working directly with the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Social Protection and Education and Skills.  It would report directly to the Taoiseach and would be responsible for the delivery of strategic job creation and training.</P>
        <P>All annual dividends paid to the State by commercial semi-State companies must be reinvested into employment activation.  We must have employment activation &mdash; this is a real opportunity to have it &mdash; and training measures, as identified by the semi-State strategy group and signed off on by the Taoiseach.  We would cap the ridiculous salaries of CEOs in semi-State companies at &euro;100,000, saving &euro;3 million.  We would reduce the cost of energy bills by running a cost efficiency drive in the energy providers and redirecting the savings.</P>
        <P>On the sale of woods and trees, the land will not be sold.  Some Labour Party Deputies have said we are only selling the trees.  They have to be sold but they should be sold by Coillte.  That is how it has been until now and the State has received the maximum benefit.</P>
        <P>The semi-State sector has huge job potential.  It has been in place throughout many recessions and when the Labour Party was in power in the 1980s.  It has stopped the country from falling <Col N="82"/>through the cracks and has provided a safety net for the economy.  It has made up a huge part of the economy which has kept the country on its feet and has huge potential to continue doing so.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Government, in particular the Labour Party and Minister, to rethink this short-term strategy and stand up to the troika.  If it feels it is being bullied it should stand up to it.  I appeal to all those in the Labour Party to revisit its manifesto, support the motion and stop the giveaway of our vital State assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Speaking in support of this motion it is important we are mindful that the sale of State assets is an integral part of Fine Gael policy.  Now, unfortunately, we know that Labour Party is on the privatisation bandwagon, despite its election promises and commitments to keep State assets in public ownership.  That is a sad position for the Labour Party to adapt.</P>
        <P>We know the Government plans to dispose of &euro;3 billion in State assets.  We do not know who will see the rewards, if any, from the selling off of these assets.  Will the workers or consumers benefit, or will venture capitalists be the real beneficiaries?  We certainly do not know if the Government&rsquo;s strategy will do anything for the 70,000 young people who are forced to leave these shores on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>For decades, companies like the ESB have played an important strategic role in the economic development of the Irish State.  It has delivered a first class electricity network that is second to none throughout Europe.  Over the past ten years, the company has paid &euro;4.3 billion euro to the State in taxes and dividends and, along with Bord G&aacute;is, has delivered a first class energy infrastructure that has created tens of thousands of skilled full-time jobs for generations of workers.  Private interests will change this.</P>
        <P>In 2009 when the housing market collapsed, ESB Networks, to its great credit, agreed a programme of on-the-job training with F&Aacute;S to take on 400 redundant electrical apprentices.  This allowed unqualified apprentices to complete their qualifications at a time when the building industry collapsed and their prospects were very bleak.  It is exactly this forward-looking kind of intervention by commercial semi-States that can assist in rebuilding the economy.  Companies like the ESB are ideally placed to create employment and develop a new skills base that can compete in a 21st century market place.</P>
        <P>Historically, semi-State companies drove Irish industry forward and broke new ground when the private sector was too cautious, unable or unwilling to invest or take risks when leadership and vision were needed.  Surely now, when families are facing a deepening economic crisis, widespread unemployment, poverty and despair, what is needed more than ever is for social and political leaders and business leaders in the commercial semi-State sector to re-embrace that vision.</P>
        <P>We know the Government&rsquo;s plan to dispose of up to &euro;3 billion in State assets and companies over the next few years includes the possible sale of Coillte, to which my colleagues referred.  Coillte&rsquo;s estate comprises 1.1 million acres, or 7% of Ireland&rsquo;s land area.  Despite this, only 11,000 people are employed in the forestry sector compared with 120,000 in Switzerland, a country half the size.</P>
        <P>The Woodland League is calling for an urgent re-evaluation of the State forestry model as part of a national public works programme, involving training for the unemployed and the creation of long-term forestry jobs as &ldquo;the backbone of a national recovery plan&rdquo;.  Will the Government consider the merit of these proposals, which could help stimulate employment?</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s public forest estate has been built up over many years with public resources as a national asset and as an investment in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  It makes no sense to sell parts of it off.  There are people who need access to Coillte land but nobody seems to be talking about their fears.</P>
        <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is on record as saying the &ldquo;sale of state assets threatens to transform companies like the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is into another Eircom [debacle].&rdquo;  It states the Government is disingenuous when it says that it does not intend to sell strategic assets, because clearly the most valuable assets we own &mdash; energy transmission and distribution networks &mdash; are the most strategic.</P>
        <P>Companies, such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, which are profitable and highly strategic, risk being asset-stripped, weakened and undermined by Government policy.  I appeal to the Government to think again about the selling of assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extremely important motion.  It provides one of the few opportunities, or perhaps the only one, the D&aacute;il will be given to vote on the monstrous plan by the Government to sell off State assets.  What is now proposed by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is monumental in its long-term economic implications for the Irish people.  One should make no mistake that what we are looking at is not only a direct continuation but an escalation of the socially destructive and economically futile policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government that wrecked the Irish economy.  A year ago this week, the electorate rejected that Government and elected what it believed was an alternative in the form of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition; yet, as we mark that anniversary, we are faced with a plan for the fire sale of State assets that far exceeds anything attempted by Fianna F&aacute;il in its worst days in office.</P>
        <P>The commercial semi-State companies &mdash; the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Coillte and Aer Lingus &mdash; were built up over many years by the hard work of Irish people and have been key pillars of the economy.  They have provided the essential infrastructure without which no economy can grow.  Energy, natural resources and strategic transport links are all indispensable assets that should remain in public ownership.</P>
        <P>The succession of Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments from 1997 began the process of privatisation of these assets.  In the case of Eircom, they were responsible for a huge debacle which should have been a lesson to the present Government.  When in opposition, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party repeatedly pointed to that reckless privatisation.</P>
        <P>In May 2005 Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion opposing the privatisation of Aer Lingus.  Speaking at that time on behalf of the Labour Party, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, the current Minister of State and the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The experience of the privatisation fiasco in Eircom should sound alarm bells for us all.  We cannot prevent venture capitalists from repeating the devastation of Eircom by stripping Aer Lingus of its assets, reducing services, putting it into serious debt and walking off with the proceeds.  We have to ask whether the Minister is incapable of learning from the mistakes of the past.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She was also correct when she told us then:</P>
        <P LI="1">Privatisation really is the new religion... Privatisation puts such services and assets at long-term risk and we should not just abandon them at the ideological whim of the coalition partners.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Perhaps the Labour Deputies would care to tell us now if the same applies to the current coalition partners.  It clearly did to Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party <i>et al</i>.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>I have not yet heard of any events to mark the centenary this year of the establishment of the Irish Labour Party &mdash; an important event in the party&rsquo;s history &mdash; but I wonder how the party will square its support in government for this fire sale of State assets to private profiteers with its claim to be the successor of James Connolly and Jim Larkin.</P>
        <P>What of Fine Gael?  The less said, the better.  We should not be surprised at its stance as it is clearly a party of the right and has championed privatisation almost as much as the Progressive Democrats.  The plan for the sale of State assets is an invitation for exploiters to reap the profits, potential profits and job-creation capacity of commercial semi-State companies.</P>
        <P>In the case of Coillte, I find it especially reprehensible that the Government would even consider selling the company&rsquo;s harvesting rights.  That is what is at stake.  Coillte is the largest land-holder in the State and while it is not, at present, proposed that its land be sold, the Government is selling access to that land and its resources.  If ever there were a strategic asset, it would be that comprising our forestry and forestry land, yet we have a plan to abandon them to private interests with very serious long-term consequences for rural areas and the whole island.</P>
        <P>There is an alternative and it is in the wording of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  The Government should retain the people&rsquo;s ownership in the companies.  The full potential of the companies has yet to be realised.  Instead of proceeding with its plan for wholesale privatisation, the Government should establish a semi-State strategy group with responsibility for delivering a strategic job creation and training project.</P>
        <P>All annual dividends paid to the State by the commercial semi-State body could be ploughed into this jobs and training strategy, thus making a major contribution to economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The path the Government is following with this privatisation plan and its other austerity measures is the road to deeper recession and long-term stagnation of the Irish economy.  I am glad the people are going to have an opportunity, as announced today by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, thankfully in this House, to give their verdict on the latest EU treaty which, if ratified, would lock this and all future Governments for many years into the austerity policies that are doing so much damage to our society and economy.</P>
        <P>The people will have an opportunity very soon to stop this futile strategy in its tracks.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in are determined to ensure they will do so.  The people will have an opportunity and chance not only to consider what is proposed in regard to the EU treaty but also to consider the Government&rsquo;s stewardship of the interests of the Irish people in the context of the wider European experience, particularly in contemporary times.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in motion is one that all Deputies, irrespective of political allegiance, should consider seriously with a view to supporting it tomorrow night.  It is incumbent on Deputies, especially those of the Labour Party, to accept that what is now being proposed by the Government at the behest of the Fine Gael influence, is absolutely anathema to everything the Labour Party Deputies stand for, have spoken for and have campaigned for over many years.  The position the Labour Party has articulated heretofore on the defence of State assets and what is ultimately the family silver of the people of the State and the whole island of Ireland has been more than sound.  Why would it now do a complete <i>volte-face</i> and abandon a position it has fought for, championed and articulated in the House time and again in my earshot throughout my 15 years as a Member?</P>
        <P>It is beyond comprehension and I appeal to Labour Party Deputies not to sell off our State assets.  They should take a stand, be courageous and stand with the people&rsquo;s interests now and in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>The selling off of State assets is a grave mistake on the part of the Government.  At a time when the Irish people need job security and the public needs a belief that the Government is fighting to protect people&rsquo;s jobs, the Government decides it is time to rid itself of some of our finest resources.</P>
        <P>Irish forestry is just one area where there is much potential to develop jobs.  This State has one of the lowest levels of forest coverage in Europe and it is an industry that could provide long-term sustainable jobs if the Government was willing to support its development and exploitation.  Growing trees is a renewable resource.  Timber and wood products are increasingly being specified ahead of other less environmentally friendly materials.  Wood biomass is a renewable source of carbon neutral, green energy that can readily displace some of Ireland&rsquo;s 90% reliance on imported fossil fuels.  Has any attempt ever been made to quantify the true job potential in wood processing?</P>
        <P>It is not just in the planting and felling of trees that jobs can be created.  Coillte has an open forest policy, which allows the public access to its forests.  This has the potential to develop the tourism sector, aided by the natural beauty of the countryside.  If the Government sells off the harvesting rights of these forests, can it guarantee that the public will be allowed to walk through those forests, as they can at the moment?</P>

	<P>Both Labour and Fine Gael gave pre-election commitments not to sell off Coillte.  Prior to entering Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Do we really want to end up in a situation where this for-profit company could turn around and do whatever it feels like with a natural resource that rightly belongs to the Irish people, including many of our forests, rivers and lakes?</P>
        <P FLI="0">Deputy Andrew Doyle said: &ldquo;That amount of land with that potential has to be kept in State ownership.&rdquo;  The selling of Coillte could have serious effects on areas of large forestry.  The Coillte N2 district covers Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Cavan and Roscommon.  Coillte owns 32,500 hectares in this district, 74% of which is planted.  There has been much talk of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of late and I have raised the issue on several occasions in this House.  Will this Government readily supply fracking companies with Coillte land and allow them to destroy not only the forests, but also the health and well-being of those living nearby?</P>
        <P>If we consider gas a State asset, and it is, how can one Minister make a decision to sell off that asset, irrespective of the serious and well-founded concerns regarding the safety, sustainability and advisability of so doing?  Surely any decision of such major importance should be agreed by Cabinet and voted on by the Oireachtas as a whole.</P>
        <P>This is privatisation by any other name.  How long will it be before we see the privatisation of our health services which are currently being slimmed down so as to appear attractive to national and international financiers?  I nearly did a double take when I heard Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin speak earlier today of the Government&rsquo;s failure to restore cancer services to Sligo Regional Hospital.  Can this be the same person who sat at the Cabinet table and collaborated with the decision to remove those services in the first place?  I was deeply concerned that, in his response, the Taoiseach referred to Sligo Regional Hospital as being among a group of &ldquo;smaller local hospitals&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>Once again we have been fed a line by this Government about what big problem is facing the Irish people.  So far it has been regional hospitals, children with special needs, smalls schools, disadvantaged schools, third level students and people in training.  The Government has repeatedly failed to address the biggest issue staring us in the face every day &mdash; that we have a jobless economy, we are losing our youngest and most talented people to emigration every day and, worst of all, we are doing nothing about it.</P>
        <P>Today we have a new scapegoat &mdash; the State assets and enterprises which provide vital services of strategic importance to the economy and its ability to operate.  They want to have a fire sale, or maybe a closing-down sale would be more appropriate, because it seems the Government has given up on creating jobs and is now intent on putting more people on the dole queue.</P>

It is not true, however, and anyone not living in ideological cloud-cuckoo land should be able to see that.  Telecom &Eacute;ireann was worth &euro;8.4 billion before it was sold off.  It had started a State mobile telephone tariff which would today be a massive feather in Ireland&rsquo;s cap had it been maintained.  Instead it was broken up and sold off so certain corrupting forces could make a lot of money.  A few Fine Gaelers and Labour people did okay out of it.</P>

	<P>A private company now owns the telecommunications network for the State and can disconnect people&rsquo;s lines on the basis that they will only reconnect them if they sign up with Eircom for 12 months.  They do not provide a better service for people in any way.  In addition, broadband roll-out was knocked back for many years and we still have not recovered to this day.</P>
        <P>People are dying in their homes due to freezing conditions brought about by poverty.  If private companies get their hands on these industries, one can only imagine where poor people will end up.  As can be seen from the Eircom fiasco, private companies are about the bottom <Col N="87"/>line, not about investment, the provision of essential services or value for money.  They are quite obviously not about providing the best services or about Ireland&rsquo;s interests, but their own.</P>
        <P>Privatisation is not an EU-IMF initiative; this is a decision by the Minister and his Government colleagues.  They are making it and cannot blame Fianna F&aacute;il or the former Progressive Democrats.

        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />that the State&rsquo;s 25% share in Aer Lingus is no longer a strategic asset, as it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy on issues such as, <i>inter alia</i>, the airline&rsquo;s landing slots at Heathrow Airport;</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">commends the Government on:</P>

        <P LI="2">notes that the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which has played a key role in developing competition in energy markets, as well as some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity, may further enhance the competitive landscape in the all-island market, for the benefit of the economy and energy consumers;</P>
        <P LI="2">agrees that the forest land owned by Coillte is an important strategic asset, which will not be sold; and</P>

	<P>I know it is very difficult but in a national crisis there is an obligation, even on Sinn F&eacute;in, to work towards the recovery of this country, as this Government is doing.  Despite their best efforts, we are going to succeed.  I welcome this opportunity to explain the rationale for the Government&rsquo;s decision announced last week to proceed with a programme of State asset disposals involving BGE Energy, some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity, some assets of Coillte and the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus.  Last week&rsquo;s announcement was the culmination of a long process which began before the current Government took office and must be seen against that background and considered in that context.</P>
        <P>In their comments following last week&rsquo;s announcement &mdash; again tonight we heard the same trite comments &mdash; it is obvious Sinn F&eacute;in Members adhere to the flat-earth policy in respect of State assets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party remains committed to significant State involvement in a modern dynamic economy.  The State can play a direct role in fostering economic growth or help provide the skills and supports that foster private sector growth.  Both are worthy of support.  An asset is not strategic simply because it is owned by the State.  Such an argument is worthy of Deputy Joe Higgins.  The world has moved on.</P>
        <P>I welcome Deputy O Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s interest in my party&rsquo;s history tonight.  We will be writing a history of the Labour Party to commemorate our centenary.  It will be much more wholesome and more civilised reading than the history of his party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Not so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has adopted a dynamic attitude to the State sector.  NewERA was established to ensure the State and the taxpayers derive best value from their investment in State companies.  It must be remembered these companies exist to serve the taxpayer; it is not the other way around.  That includes releasing capital back into a capital-starved economy, if that is in the people&rsquo;s interest.</P>
        <P>We have been at pains to point out what the public interest is and to protect it.  Unlike Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s privatisation of Eircom, properly criticised by the Deputies opposite, there is no sale proposed of strategic networks or assets.  The ESB remains a vertically integrated utility free to compete in the soon-to-arrive European market place.  The gas network will remain entirely in public ownership.  So too will Dublin Port.  We will not sell the Coillte land.  Selling the crop of trees is not a catastrophe.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Far from being hostile to State enterprise, the Government is setting up a State company, Irish Water, to run water services unlike the arrangements in our neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that why water charges will be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We continue to believe the State has an active role to play in the market place.  We also recognise, however, the strategic interest of the State does not remain static or fixed over time.  What was strategic when electricity was installed across the country in the 1930s is not necessarily strategic now in a competitive all-island market place.</P>
        <P>When the current Government took office almost a year ago, it inherited a situation whereby the State was unable to fund itself but instead was dependent on funding from the EU-IMF under a programme negotiated by the previous Government.  The work of the review group on <Col N="90"/>State assets and liabilities, under the chairmanship of Colm McCarthy and commissioned by the previous Government, was still in train but was approaching finalisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Which the Minister opposed at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The McCarthy group subsequently reported in April 2011 and concluded the realisation of proceeds from the sale of State assets offered the potential to assist in tackling the fiscal crisis, both by reducing the debt burden on the State and also by supporting economic recovery through enhancing productive efficiency and competitiveness.  It recommended a planned programme of non-strategic asset sales should be undertaken.</P>
        <P>The original memorandum of understanding with the EU-ECB-IMF funding partners also addressed the issue of asset disposals.  It required the Irish authorities to undertake an independent assessment of the electricity and gas sectors, building on the work of the review group, and to consult with the European Commission services with a view to setting appropriate targets for the privatisation of State-owned assets.</P>
        <P>In negotiating a programme for Government, the two Government parties accepted a new approach to the management and use of State assets, in the interests of the economy, the people and job creation, was required as part of the mechanism to address the fiscal crisis.  The programme for Government included a commitment to release value from the State&rsquo;s portfolio of assets with the intention of using these proceeds to fund investment in the productive capacity of the economy in the context of the NewERA entity which we propose to establish.  A target of up to &euro;2 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets was agreed, drawing from the recommendations of the review group but with the assets only to be sold when market conditions were right and when adequate regulatory structures had been established to protect consumers.</P>
        <P>Since the Government took office last year, we have made significant progress in advancing the Government&rsquo;s plans with regard to making better use of our State assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, the Government established NewERA to reform the manner in which the State&rsquo;s shareholding in semi-State companies is managed for the good of every citizen.  NewERA is proactively overseeing corporative governance from a shareholder perspective of the commercial energy area semi-State companies, the ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  It is advising relevant Ministers on matters such as dividend policy, capital investment plans, approval of borrowings and so on.</P>
        <P>The Government has also set up the strategic investment fund in the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as the forerunner to the strategic investment bank.  Drawing on resources from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, in combination with matching commercial investment from private investors, the strategic investment fund will channel resources towards the productive sector in the economy.  The &euro;1 billion we can get from the sale of State assets will be one element of getting absolutely needed capital.  We will also use the NPRF, the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank, as well as any other private sector funding we can leverage, to drive an agenda of growth and recovery.  NewERA is working closely with the strategic investment fund and the NPRF to ensure commercial investment opportunities are developed.</P>
        <P>Considerable progress has also been made over the past year in assessing the suitability of a range of State assets.  Two working groups were established in 2011 &mdash; one to consider the best approach in progressing the proposed part-sale of the ESB, including energy policy, regulatory, <Col N="91"/>legal, financial and economic considerations; and the other to undertake a similar analysis of several other State assets.  Both of these groups completed their work in 2011 and reported to Ministers in December 2011.</P>
        <P>NewERA was also centrally involved in this process, together with my Department, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Finance.  It was on the basis of the analysis undertaken by these two working groups that the Government last week agreed to the list of asset disposals announced on 22 February.  It also agreed not to proceed with the minority stake in the vertically integrated ESB as had been previously decided as it was not the best way to advance.  The analysis undertaken on the original proposed ESB transaction identified a range of complex regulatory, legislative and policy issues which would have to be addressed before a part-sale of the company as an integrated utility could proceed.  Accordingly, it was not practical to continue to proceed with that proposal.</P>
        <P>The Government has also achieved a significant breakthrough in our negotiations with the troika on the use of State assets.  I thank our partners for the protracted engagement on this matter.  Instead of the troika&rsquo;s original plan that a programme of asset sales of &euro;5 billion be used exclusively to retire debt, we have now agreed that in return for committing to a target of up to &euro;3 billion, the Government will be permitted to retain one third of the proceeds generated to invest in job creation initiatives to stimulate the economy which is so desperately needed and of which the Deputies opposite are right.  Jobs are the focus, first and last, of the Government.</P>

	<P>Was I clear enough?</P>

	<P>It is the second jobs strategy so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Assets will be sold on acceptable terms and at a price that achieves fair value for the taxpayer.  Key strategic assets, such as electricity and gas transmission and distribution systems will not be included in the disposal programme, but will be retained in State ownership.  I believe the agreement reached with the troika represents real and significant progress.</P>
        <P>I will turn now to the specific assets that are to be sold.  In deciding on the programme that I announced last week, the Government has been careful to safeguard the position of strategic infrastructure such as the electricity and gas networks, which are considered to be vital to the functioning of the economy.  The House will have noted that these assets are not part of the disposal programme and will remain under State control.  What will be sold is the energy business of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, but not including BGE&rsquo;s gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors, which will remain in State ownership.  I refer by and large to the wind energy and other soft energy options that BGE has built up over time.  Nobody can argue that they must be held in State ownership from a strategic point of view.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>The Minister for Communications Energy and Natural Resources will consult with the Commission for Energy Regulation and the ESB and advise the Government on the specific ESB assets that are to be sold, with the objective of materially improving the competitive dynamics of the single electricity market to the benefit of consumers, as well as realising the assets for the productive purposes I have outlined.</P>
        <P>I ask the House to pay attention to the next point as it is a different decision.  We have said on the first level of issues that we will sell them when the market conditions and regulatory issues are right, but on Coillte, consideration will be given to the sale of some of its assets.  This will focus primarily on the harvesting rights of Coillte&rsquo;s forests, but I have already made it clear that Coillte&rsquo;s landholding is not for sale.</P>
        <P>The Government now accepts that the State&rsquo;s remaining 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus is not a strategic asset, as it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy on issues such as the use of the airline&rsquo;s landing slots at Heathrow Airport.  Unfortunately, the previous Administration, in selling off 75% of the company already moved that out of State hands.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus will be sold at an appropriate time, when market conditions are favourable and an acceptable price is agreed.</P>
        <P>The policy that has been pursued by the Government that we set out and that has been carefully tacked over the past year in terms of reforming the manner in which State assets are managed for the benefit of the taxpayer and job creation to get the best value for the shareholders, namely, the people of this country, is the right thing to do.  We have identified the optimal means of releasing value from some non-strategic State assets, in an appropriate way, which is the right thing to do given the fiscal and economic challenges facing the economy.  I am confident that the asset disposal programme which I announced last week &mdash; for the information of Deputies opposite it was endorsed unanimously by Government &mdash;  will have a significantly positive outcome by driving competition and driving down prices in the energy sector as well as generating desperately needed resources for investment in jobs and the recovery of the economy.  On that basis, I commend the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister on his speech, his approach and his amendment to the motion.  Some Members on the benches opposite are content to rewrite history.  The Government on the other hand has been active in renegotiating elements of the agreement with the troika and has correctly put jobs at the centre of its policies.  I pose the question to Deputy Ferris and the Members opposite in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party of whether they want to see the country rise or fall.  That is a question they must answer in their hearts.  Do they want the country to rise or fall?  Do they want people to prosper or to come to the House and whinge continually?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very difficult question to ask.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The initial version of the agreement required the Government to set appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of State-owned assets.  It contained no commitment to investment in the economy.  By co-operating and working with the troika, the Government delivered on its commitment to renegotiate the agreement.  The Members opposite said it could not be done but it was done.  When the Government took office it faced the restrictive agreement and it was told that renegotiation would not be possible but it was done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>What renegotiation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="93"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On the interest rates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreement was reached with the troika on the sale of State assets and the reinvestment of the proceeds into the economy.  That is another example of the Government&rsquo;s successful renegotiation.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said there will be no fire sale of non-strategic assets.  I welcome that and put it on the record of the House.  As Deputy Ferris well knows, the McCarthy report recommended the sale of non-strategic assets.  The programme for Government confirmed that the sale of State assets would be used to stimulate growth and create employment.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposals meet both of those aims.  I welcome the fact that he is not rushing into a fire sale of assets and that he is carefully assessing each asset to ensure that there will not be a fire sale.  I commend him on his approach.  As the Minister outlined in his speech, it is critical that we achieve the best value for the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the Government&rsquo;s approach that we are going to learn from the mistakes of the Eircom debacle.  I hope the members of the Government that was in power such as the then Ministers, Mrs. O&rsquo;Rourke and Deputy Martin, listen and learn from that.  It was a debacle that risked the country&rsquo;s prosperity.  As the Minister indicated, the Government will not sell the gas transmission and distribution system or the two gas interconnectors.  Unlike Eircom, those two vital pieces of infrastructure will remain in State ownership.  As the Minister indicated, when the Government considers the sale of Coillte, the land will not be included.  Again, another lesson has been learned from the Eircom case.</P>
        <P>Since the Government came to power 12 months ago it has consistently made job creation its focus.  We have seen the jobs initiative working this week in my city and county of Cork.</P>

	<P>There is not much to say following the speech of the Minister, Deputy Howlin but I will use the four minutes allocated to me if Deputy Ferris does not interrupt me.  I thank him for not interrupting.</P>
        <P>The idea of selling any non-strategic State assets arose out of the collapse of the economy and the funding difficulty the State had then and now.  As much as I hate to say it, the reality is that Fianna F&aacute;il was responsible for it.  We should not be criticised for reminding people of that as often as needs be.  Fianna F&aacute;il also set out the process we are discussing tonight with the McCarthy report, which commissioned a review of the sale of State assets.  From the comments last week it is clear that Deputy Martin and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are now seeking to distance themselves from those remarks.  When the McCarthy report was undertaken it was charged to consider the potential for asset disposals in the public sector, including commercial State bodies, in view of the indebtedness of the State.  One could ask whether the party was aware of what was happening.  The review proposed &euro;5 billion worth of asset sales in May before the EU and IMF even came to town.</P>
        <P>Whether we like it or not we are in a programme of support from the IMF and the EU.  Raising State finances through asset sales is part of our agreement with them.  That is the reality of where we are at, whether we like it or not.  We are in a funding programme with other European countries and the IMF because we cannot pay our bills.  A huge proportion of the bills are a result of the burden placed on us by the disastrous initial bank guarantee but either way, this is where we are at.  As difficult as it is, the Government is dealing with the situation.</P>
        <P>We can differ on whether the approach being taken is right or wrong but I believe this is the way to go.  It would be easy to suggest that none of this is necessary.  With no disrespect to anyone in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, my firm belief is that is the easy option.  The easy option is to say that what we are doing is wrong.  It would be easy to say we do not have to sell anything and that we can easily find funds elsewhere to invest in jobs and reduce debt but that is simply not the case.  Let us have a debate that recognises that this is where we are at, and that we must do what is being outlined.</P>
        <P>Selling State assets that have been built up over generations gives me no satisfaction, nor does it give me satisfaction to discuss the matter in the House, but I am trying to deal with our situation.  I have great admiration for the workers in ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is who built up services and facilities.  They should have a full say in the matter and their interests should be kept in mind when these assets are being sold.</P>
        <P>However, I am mindful of people who are out of work and for whom we cannot provide jobs.  That said, there have been some recent shoots.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, referred to an approximate 1,000 jobs.  The unemployed must be at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s plan.  That is the case in this instance.  It is not about selling assets for the sake of it.  The sale is to allow us to develop a climate in which the growth of more jobs can be encouraged.  As a Government, we do not have many options in tackling unemployment while meeting the commitments of the EU-IMF deal.  We must repay what we owe and create jobs.</P>
        <P>The proposal to raise &euro;3 billion through the sale of non-strategic State assets contains a carrot, given the prospect of re-investing &euro;1 billion in the State so we can create jobs and, as is the case with Members, give people the dignity of doing a day&rsquo;s work.  People call for this dignity daily, but we are not in a position to provide it.  The State&rsquo;s main obligation is to scrub up &euro;1 billion and create a climate that allows more mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters to live with dignity and to feel like valued citizens.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important debate at a time when our country demands real leadership as we navigate our way through this crisis.  There are no easy options for any Government or Deputy.  When the Opposition makes reasonable and practical proposals, the Government will welcome them and give them due consideration.  However, where proposals are unrealistic and many of the arguments make no economic sense, we must approach them differently.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s reasonable, considered and pragmatic approach to this issue.  Under an initial proposal, a minority stake in the ESB was to be sold.  Having considered the idea in depth and examined the complexities involved, the Government has instead proposed alternatives whereby non-strategic assets, such as the ESB&rsquo;s power generation capacity, can be considered for sale.</P>
        <P>As many Deputies have stated, lessons have been learned from the farcical sale of Eircom, the result of which has seen State development, agencies, businesses and our education system deprived of network access.  Lessons have been learned and such mistakes will not be made again.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that this will not be a fire sale.  The markets will be approached reasonably so that value can be found.  It is important to remember that the Government has renegotiated with the troika to ensure that one third of proceeds raised in excess of &euro;1 billion will go directly towards economic stimulus and investment measures.</P>
        <P>I am amazed that Sinn F&eacute;in, which continuously calls for stimulus and investment, is opposing a realistic mechanism that will deliver them and create jobs.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the party of negativity.  All it does is oppose everything and it does not offer realistic solutions.  Sinn F&eacute;in takes a populist approach that the Irish people will see through.  Of most concern is that Sinn F&eacute;in believes itself.  I respect its members as elected Deputies, in that they also have mandates, but their rhetoric in the House is concerning.  This week, the way their colleague managed printers and ink displayed how they might manage State assets if they got anywhere near power.  This is not a cheap shot.  It drives directly to the question of how responsible Sinn F&eacute;in would be in government.  If this is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s type of responsibility, God help us all.</P>
        <P>We need a responsible, considered approach to navigating our way through this crisis.  The Government will sweat off some of our non-strategic assets and gain the capacity to introduce investment and create jobs, thereby helping the economy.  I welcome this.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies&rsquo; contributions.  What they stated about selling Coillte&rsquo;s lands was not true.  The Government has gone to extreme lengths to point out that those lands will be retained in Coillte.  However, we will consider the sale of the harvest on those lands, just as any productive farmer would.  Our exports are as strong as they are because productivity and growth in the agricultural sector are strong.  The Government is right to consider sweating that asset as much as possible to create a new revenue stream and to return the country to work.</P>

	<P>No, we did not.  I will address the factual situation later.  Some 100% of the sale of any State asset should be used for job creation, growth, economic development and investment.  It is only through economic growth and investment that we can work our way out of our financial difficulties.</P>
        <P>I have read the wording of the memorandum again.  The Minister seems to believe some of the scripts being published in his name, he has read them out so often.  The people believe what he is saying and the media seems to have accepted it.  However, some of his comments on the contents of the memorandum of understanding have not been true.  According to him, the original memorandum&rsquo;s only commitment was to address the issue through the McCarthy report.  The programme&rsquo;s targets can and will be achieved without the proceeds of asset sales.  The memorandum of understanding contained no figure on the sale of State assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>

	<P>I will go through the facts and the exact sequence of events.  Under the memorandum of understanding that the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government signed in December 2010, we agreed to undertake an independent assessment of the electricity and gas sectors with a view towards enhancing their difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I would hope it was not meant to enhance difficulties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and &ldquo;setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation&rdquo; of State assets.  I am quoting the memorandum.  This section of the memorandum dealt with raising Ireland&rsquo;s growth potential.  It was not the section on safeguarding public finances, namely, paying our debt.</P>
        <P>Changes occurred.  Following the new Government entering into office 12 months ago, the memorandum read: &ldquo;It is important that we make effective use of State assets and, where appropriate, dispose of them to help reduce our Government debt.&rdquo;  This was the Government&rsquo;s decision and was not contained in the earlier commitment.</P>
        <P>I will nail the most important point.  The Minister and his colleagues in government claim they are tied by the memorandum of understanding to which we signed up.  They are trying to convince the people they are tied by provisions that were not contained in the original memorandum of understanding.  The Minister claims these were being discussed by someone somewhere in the ether.</P>

	<P>This has not been publicly acknowledged until now, although Fine Gael had wanted to do it for years.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The best way to clear a debt is by earning more money to pay it back.  Everyone knows that we have to grow our way out of a recession.  We cannot get out of it by selling off State assets in the absence of growth.  That is where the process goes wrong.  This policy is entirely the Government&rsquo;s because we never made a commitment to use the sale of State assets to write down debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>In July the Minister stated that he was committed to selling State assets and, more importantly, the agreement signed in the past few weeks commits the Government to an ambitious programme of State asset disposal designed to enhance the efficiency <Col N="98"/>and competitiveness of the economy, reduce sovereign financing needs and provide additional resources for investment.  Instead of claiming credit for getting an agreement on investing one third of the money in employment creation, he should admit that he lost the battle because the majority of money raised from this process will be used to pay down the debt.  This was not in the original agreement.</P>

We never signed up to it and we are not responsible for the measures his Government agreed to if they were not in the original agreement.</P>
        <P>I also believe the timing is wrong.  The Government is jumping the gun because it would have been better to tell the troika that while Fine Gael might not have an ideological difficulty with selling State assets, now is not the time to even discuss the issue.  The Minister published the McCarthy review of the sale of State assets last year but he will not publish the information that persuaded him to make this decision.  He pulled the figure of &euro;3 billion out of thin air.  No evidence has been published to back it up.  It is similar to the figure he published on 17 November 2011 when he claimed that public sector reform would lead to a payroll reduction of &euro;2.5 billion.  No evidence was produced to support that claim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I sent the figures to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>I accept that over the economic cycle State companies will be established, grow to maturity and be sold off or remain in State ownership for generations.  My party has been involved in establishing a considerable number of semi-State companies over the years, as well as selling off some of them when it was appropriate to do to.  It is a question of looking after the interests of the Irish people.  In respect of strategic generation power plants, however, control must be maintained anywhere a hydroelectric generating station can control water levels, as is the case at Ardnacrusha, the Inniscarra dam on the River Lee and Turlough Hill.  I welcome that the Minister appears to agree with me because I would not like the private sector to be able to decide the water levels on the River Shannon or the River Lee.  From that point of view, strategic importance is based on more than the ability to generate electricity.</P>
        <P>Problems also arise when there are too many private companies operating in the market.  Approximately 300 different price packages are available in England but nobody can be sure they offer value for money.  Furthermore, the questions of customers who must deal with difficult accounts and what happens to the staff of these companies have not been addressed sufficiently.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Government is not selling the freehold title to Coillte land but we need further details on the arrangement.  The Minister told us that he cannot share commercially sensitive information but he expects to sign a blank cheque.  We cannot agree to the proposal until we get adequate information.  The Government proposes to sell the right to harvest the forests.  In effect it will hand over these trees and the land on which they are growing for 30 years until the crop is mature.  During that period the public will have no right to access the land because it will be a private sector work site.  The health and safety rules will be quoted and the land will be treated as private property for 30 years.  We will not even be able to exploit it for its tourism potential.</P>
        <P>The question of carbon credits for forestry and power generation has not been addressed sufficiently.  Will the purchasers be given carbon credits with the assets in order that they sell them at a profit without producing a megawatt of electricity?  The Minister cannot expect us to provide a worked out response without this information.</P>
        <P>If the Government does not intend to use all the proceeds from the sale of these State assets for job creation, investment and growth of the economy, it should not sell them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the future direction of our State assets.  I have considerable respect for the Minister&rsquo;s honesty.  I urge him to ask his Labour Party ministerial colleagues to desist from pinning his agenda of selling State assets on Fianna F&aacute;il.  The facts speak for themselves.  The Minister for Finance admitted on many occasions in response to Deputy Michael McGrath on Question Time that this was not a route decided on by Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  We did what any Government should do, namely, take stock of the State&rsquo;s assets.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Government should stop misinforming the public on the facts and the chronological order in which they occurred.  There is a trend in this country that if one says something twice on RTE it becomes fact.  It ill behoves any Minister to mislead the Irish public.</P>
        <P>The debate over ownership of State assets cannot be simplified into left and right positions.  We will have to take a pragmatic view of what is right for the country in social and financial terms.  The Government is right to take its time in considering these issues but if it decides to sell it should do so at the optimum time.  Prior to selling semi-State companies, however, it needs to look after the employees who built them up and have become major stakeholders in them.  When we speak about privatisation, we cannot avoid the subject of job losses.  Significant issues arise in respect of jobs and livelihoods for the employees, their families and the communities in which they live.  In his contribution the Minister made no mention of the pension funds <Col N="100"/>associated with some of these State companies.  We know there are large deficits in many of these pension funds, which needs to be considered thoroughly.</P>
        <P>Before we go any further down the road of developing a policy on the disposal of our State assets we need to introduce other legislation that comes under the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is to establish a register of lobbyists.  That is critical legislation in bringing the transparency we need.  My party has published legislation in that regard and I know the Minister is working on it.  I believe it would be agreed by all parties in this House.  We all know the high-profile Ministers who were household names now engaged in the business of lobbying and there is nothing wrong with that.  However, equally there is a coterie of people, including former civil servants who are not household names, who are attempting to influence public policy.  They have ready access to top-level civil servants and to Government.  It is only fair that the public should know who these people are.</P>
        <P>We also need a serious debate on what State assets are strategic and what are non-strategic.  In that regard, why is the remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus now being viewed as a non-strategic State asset?  In my part of the country &mdash; the mid-west &mdash; we regard the potential loss of the Heathrow landing slots as critical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and we have a number of members on the board.  We in the mid-west region need to retain the landing slots.  In 2007 my part of the country went into a convulsion because we lost the Shannon to Heathrow route.  The Minister&rsquo;s party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, stated at the time:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have had enough of the flowery sympathetic speeches.  We want the Government to use its clout on the Board of the Company and insist that the Shannon-Heathrow route is maintained.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I echo those sentiments.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, is now in government and I want to hold her, her party and the Fine Gael Party to their word.  We need to maintain the Heathrow route for connectivity in the mid-west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the mid-west region lose out to County Louth for the PayPal investment?  It is because the Government is not prioritising the mid-west.  As a Deputy representing the mid-west, I feel the Government is resiling from its responsibility.  In order to keep the mid-west&rsquo;s competitive edge, we need to keep the Shannon to Heathrow route and the only way to keep it is by maintaining our 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have lost them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Minister rubbishing it now?  A few years ago when his party was in opposition it nearly brought the House down over the Shannon to Heathrow route, with which I agreed because it was critical.  I was glad the then Government worked hard and put in board members, when they did not have them previously, and restored the Shannon to <Col N="101"/>Heathrow route.  It is incumbent on the Minister to acknowledge that the Shannon to Heathrow route is a critical strategic State asset for the mid-west region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have sold the control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I implore the Minister to use his common sense in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reminded of the clich&eacute; about marrying in haste and repenting at leisure.  We have had decisions that were made rather hastily usually just based on figures and not considering the impact on lives.  I am very glad about the repenting &mdash; the reversal on the proposed cuts to DEIS schools and today&rsquo;s announcement that the people will be given the chance to vote in a referendum on the fiscal compact.</P>
        <P>The review group that analysed State assets did so purely from a financial perspective without considering the social or environmental costs, which need to be taken into account.  Selling State assets seems to be part of the IMF solution to economic recovery which has been seen in other countries such as Argentina.  Selling State assets means privatisation.  We have had the debacle of the privatisation of waste services in Dublin recently whereby a very suspect auditing company got the decision to make.  The contract was given to a company that had been prosecuted and found guilty of charges under the EPA and there was a very definite lack of accountability in the contract.  The aim seems to be to raise &euro;3 billion from the privatisation programme with &euro;2 billion being used to pay down the debt and &euro;1 billion to assist in boosting employment.  However, if the debt burden is &euro;119 billion, &euro;2 billion will not make much difference and there could be a wiser investment for it.</P>
        <P>In some of our State companies there is a culture of obscene salaries with dreadful expense accounts and allowances.  Changing that is one aspect of privatisation I would welcome.  At times State companies have been guilty of poor service with high prices.  Even though these companies are being presented as being self-financing, they have been heavily developed through public funding, not with a view to selling them off to the highest bidder &mdash; an invisible bondholder, some offshore tax-evading tycoon or a foreign oligarch.  There are examples in Portugal at the moment.  While I know the Chinese are our best friends, there are issues with their investments in some developing countries.</P>
        <P>The State assets need to be considered on more than their market and economic values.  There are strategic elements attached to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB that are vital to our energy security, particularly in the development of alternative energy sources such as wind power.  I share the Woodland League&rsquo;s concerns concerning our forests &mdash; the access, the carbon value of the trees and the possibilities for a national works programme.  I hope selling off our shareholding in Aer Lingus will not prove to be short-sighted.  If the privatised companies fail, who will bail them out?  Will they come back to the Government again?  <i>Festina lente</i>.</P>

	<P>I am glad to be able to speak on tonight&rsquo;s motion.  I compliment the Minister on his efforts in many areas.  He has a sobering ministerial role in a Government that seems to have gone for a slash and burn approach.  The Labour Party was founded in Clonmel 100 year ago.  The current mayor of the town is rightly looking forward to hosting the Labour Party in remembering its proud history.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be there.  The Government is throwing the baby out with the bathwater in many areas.  I have no hang-ups about selling some of our State assets, but I have a hang-up if they are to be sold to pay off our debt &mdash; a debt that is too high and which the ordinary working people did not incur.  I welcome the referendum that was announced today and I also welcome the reversal in the cuts to the DEIS schools.  However, I do not welcome that the rural schools will suffer as a result.  I applaud anybody who acknowledges a mistake and tries to correct it.  However, mistakes in that area also need to be corrected.</P>
        <P>Selling off the timber in Coillte woods may be an ideal way to look at it.  As someone said earlier, one needs to sweat them hard to make them pay like any crop.  However, these crops have a 30 to 40-year cycle.  Will the land be available for recreational purposes for people to take walks etc.?  If we are going to sell it, it should be for the harvest time for a period of a few years before they are ready for harvesting and get a new crop in.  What about the carbon credit issue?  Will we lose them also?  What about the employees?  They should be paramount especially for Labour Party Ministers in the spirit of James Larkin and James Connolly.  Many good employees gave their lives to and have worked very hard for the forest service and latterly Coillte.  They had pride in their work and their forests.  One used to see entrances to forests with stiles that were painted showing the respect they had.  However, now it is laid waste under Coillte because it is all about making a fast buck and there is no pride in fencing off forests from farmlands.</P>
        <P>Many people worked at Telecom &Eacute;ireann and the sale of that company did not do any justice to the workers and resulted in us losing control over valuable infrastructure in that area.  We should make haste slowly and examine what happened with Eircom and how many times it has been sold on since.</P>
        <P>I do not want to see retired politicians, who may have made some contribution here, or former public servants who have been paid off with large pensions now working as lobbyists.  A very senior former politician has been linked with the sale of Coillte, which is scandalous.  For people leaving with large lump sums and pensions there should be a moratorium of at least ten years &mdash; if ever &mdash; before they can return as lobbyists.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 86 together. </P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the agreement that the Government reached with the Troika was a remarkable advance on the position originally advanced by them and I do not propose to reopen the matter.</P>
        <P>I would remind the Deputies that the Troika was originally pressing for asset sales of &euro;5bn to be used exclusively to off-set debt.  In the course of our discussions, we have achieved a significant breakthrough on how the proceeds of asset disposals are to be used.  In return for committing to a disposal programme of up to &euro;3bn, the Troika has agreed to the retention of one-third of the proceeds for reinvestment in the economy.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the asset disposal programme that I announced last week can have a significantly positive outcome by driving competition in the energy sector and facilitating much needed investment in our economic recovery.</P>

	<P>Shared services is a key aspect of the Public Service Reform Plan.  The benefits of shared services are well documented internationally, including in public service contexts.  They include: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />standardisation of processes allowing for greater transparency and accessibility;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />reduced duplication;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the elimination of waste; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />significant cost reductions in the medium term.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has given my Department a strong mandate to advance the actions necessary to ensure that we deliver on the very ambitious commitments made in the Reform Plan.  Good progress is already being made.  Work on a shared service approach to Human Resources for the Civil Service is currently ongoing.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Shared Services Transformation Manager with global experience of shared service delivery joined the Reform and Delivery Office of my Department last week and I am confident that this additional expertise will help to accelerate the progression of this important agenda to drive greater value for money in how the relevant services are delivered.</P>
        <P>In line with the Public Service Reform Plan, we are taking a sectoral approach to the development of shared services.  This means that within each of the sectors of Health, Education, Justice, Local Government and Defence a lead official will be charged with preparing and delivering on a strategic shared services plan appropriate to that sector by the end of June.  The Shared Services Transformation Manager will lead on the Civil Service plan and will also provide central support and guidance on shared service best practice.  In addition, and in line with project management best practice, Senior Responsible Owners and Project Managers are being identified for the Civil Service back-office projects as we move into the design and implementation phases.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As the Deputies are aware, the Government is committed to further reducing Public Service numbers to 282,500 by 2015.  This is in line with the Programme for Government and will allow us to achieve the paybill reductions that are required in accordance with the agreement with our external funding partners.</P>
        <P>The Government has ensured that attention is being given to safeguarding frontline services in so far as possible.  The moratorium will continue with certain limited exceptions for example in relation to some frontline posts, or statutory positions, etc. where a sufficiently strong business case is made to my Department.  In the Health and Education sectors in particular special arrangements are in place for exemptions to the moratorium on recruitment for specified grades or positions.  Of course, responsibility for operational planning in the context of reducing resources rests in the first instance, with each Public Service body and its parent Department.  The Public Service Reform Plan and the Croke Park Agreement provide a range of mechanisms for discharging work including work reorganisation, changes to rosters or working hours, new methods of service delivery and redeployment of staff.  Each public service body has scope to fully utilise these mechanisms as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Transition Teams have been put in place for each of the sectors to deal with the specific short-term challenges arising from the ending of the grace period and to manage the process in their respective sectors.  These teams are drawn from the existing Strategic Workforce Planning Groups whose task it is to ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions in the coming years.</P>

In return for committing to a disposal programme of up to &euro;3bn, which is a more ambitious target than we had originally provided for in the Programme for Government, the Troika has agreed to the retention of one-third of the proceeds for reinvestment in the economy.</P>
        <P>In deciding on the programme that I announced last week, the Government has been careful to safeguard the position of strategic infrastructure such as the electricity and gas networks and Dublin port and the House will have noted that they are not part of the disposal programme and will remain under State control.</P>
        <P>Apart from the receipts from the sale of assets that the Government will retain for reinvestment in the economy, the sale of certain business units of State companies actually offers the prospect of access to significant new capital to grow these businesses, which might not have otherwise have been available, given the current position in capital markets.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 108 together.  </P>
        <P>The Government Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 provides that the Government will establish a new model of financing social interventions called Social Impact Bonds that share audited Exchequer savings with charitable and voluntary organisations.  My Department is considering how best to establish this new and innovative mechanism and will bring forward proposals in due course.  An advisory group chaired by a recently retired Secretary General has been established to explore the potential for Social Impact Bonds and my Department is represented on this group.</P>
        <P>A scoping exercise of the potential of Social Impact Bonds is being conducted on behalf of the advisory group by Clann Credo &mdash; the social investment fund in conjunction with Atlantic Philanthropies and the Centre for Effective Studies.  This followed on a wide call to Government Departments, State Agencies and the community and voluntary sector for ideas that might be suitable for Social Impact Bonds.</P>
        <P>Following on from these consultations, further work is progressing on the feasibility of a short listed number of areas which would be suitable to test the concept in an Irish context.</P>
        <P>It is hoped to pilot at least one of these areas later this year and my department expects to receive a progress update on this short listing exercise from the advisory group shortly.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding circular LP 6/7/2001; his views on the appropriateness of required notice periods in the public sector; his plans to require for additional notice of early retirement to be given by senior public servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Circular letter LP 6/7/2011 provides that civil service staff should give a three-month notice period of their intention to retire in the period up to and including 29 February 2012.  Other sectors of the public service have adopted a similar approach to a notice period.</P>
        <P>The three month notice period was introduced as a temporary measure to assist management across the public service in dealing with the large number of retirements of staff in the run up to the end of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; &mdash; i.e. the period during which the calculation of pension is unaffected by the pay reductions applied under the <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009</i>.</P>
        <P>In order to protect public services it was critical that management in each of the sectors had knowledge of the numbers of staff retiring and the business areas that might be affected by potentially large scale departures.</P>
        <P>We are required under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF to make quarterly returns on the progress being made in relation to reductions in numbers in the public service.  Accurate and early information on forthcoming retirements is an important part of this reporting requirement.  It provides us with information on whether the reduction in the public service pay bill arising from impending retirements is sufficient to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to issue a revised instruction in relation to notice requirements for retirements and resignations which take place after 29th February 2012.  As numbers reduce across the public service it will remain critical that management know when key staff will be leaving their organisation.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Memorandum of Understanding will continue to be a driver in the continuing effort to reduce public service numbers.  It is important, therefore, that we continue to have the most up-to-date information possible with regard to retirements going forward.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that discussions with the civil service unions on the introduction of a required notice period will commence shortly. The question of senior civil servants and key personnel giving longer notice will also be examined and, if necessary, will be provided for.   </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The superannuation terms for Secretaries General are in line with their contractual arrangements.  Currently serving Secretaries General appointed under the TLAC process have exit arrangements which are part of their terms of employment following a Government decision at the time of appointment.  These may include the offer of an alternative post in the Public Service, or a severance payment and retirement on enhanced pension.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General is that the Government does not have discretion to change those terms.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government introduced a new regime to apply to new Secretaries General on completion of their term of office.  Newly appointed Secretaries General, unless they have already reached pension age, will no longer benefit from immediate payment of pension and lump sum before they reach preserved pension age; nor will they benefit from notional added years for pension purposes.  These are significant changes compared to the exit terms which applied to previous appointees.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of pension-related measures have been implemented in the Public Service which affect Secretaries General.  The pay reductions introduced since 2010 will impact on pension benefits for those retiring after the end of the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, i.e. from 1 March 2012 onwards.  The pensions of those retiring before that date are subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) which was introduced in January 2011.  I also recently provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions over &euro;100,000 from 12% to 20% which will affect Secretaries General on pensions above that level.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill to provide for a Single Public Service Pension Scheme is currently before the Oireachtas and will be implemented this year.  It will introduce a pension based on career average earnings, rather than the current system of pension based on final salary, for those who will be members of the scheme. </P>

        <P>Remuneration in excess of the maximum point of the Principal Officer (standard) scale has been sanctioned by me in a number of instances based on the business case presented.

	<P>In deciding on the programme of asset disposals that I announced last week, the Government has been careful to safeguard the position of strategic infrastructure such as the electricity and gas networks and Dublin port and the deputy will have noted that they are not part of the disposal programme that I announced. The Government recognizes that this key infrastructure is vital to the optimum functioning of the economy and ensuring, inter alia, provision of quality services to all parts of the country and they will remain under State control. </P>
        <P>The relevant Government Departments, overseen by my department and with the assistance of NewERA are now progressing matters with the objective of identifying by end-March any remaining policy, regulatory, legislative and/or financial issues, including the issues that the Deputy refers to, that may need to be addressed prior to disposal. Great care will be taken at all times to ensure any decisions are in the national interest and represent value for the Exchequer. It is intended that any issues arising will be addressed by the end of 2012 in order to facilitate transactions commencing in 2013.</P>
        <P>I do not expect that a substantial new regulatory regime will be required to enforce Ireland&rsquo;s obligation under EU environmental legislation on foot of the programme of State asset disposals that I announced last week.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill &mdash; which had passed all stages in the Seanad and had moved onto the D&aacute;il order paper &mdash;  into a robust piece of legislation. </P>
        <P>In order to address a number of issues that were raised during the consultation on the Bill a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was carried out. The RIA was completed and published on 27 September. The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>www.per.gov.ie/reports</i>.</P>
        <P>The RIA examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention. It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation. In addition, the RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation. It found that there were merits to considering amending the Bill in a number of respects e.g. to bring lower value contracts within its scope and to make the adjudicators award binding in payment dispute cases. It concluded that any such amendments should be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Following the RIA, Minister Hayes has now prepared proposals to progress this legislation and these are now being brought to Government for approval. It is essential that the solution to this issue needs to be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On 17th November last year, I launched the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan.  The Plan differs from previous initiatives in that it provides a new imperative for cost reductions and service improvements in a context of falling Public Service numbers, linked closely to governance structures and processes designed to ensure implementation.  It contains a wide range of actions and commitments, with very clear timelines, to radically reform structures, operations and processes across the Public Service.  </P>
        <P>These reforms reflect five major commitments to change, namely: placing customer service at the core of everything we do; maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; <Col N="114"/>radically reducing costs to drive better value for money; leading, organising and working in new ways; and a strong focus on implementation and delivery.</P>
        <P>The actions set out in the Reform Plan are accompanied by specified timescales for completion and Departments and major Offices have also devised their own high level Integrated Reform Delivery Plans.  This combination of reforms at central, sectoral and organisational levels represents an integrated and coordinated approach to change in the Public Service.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to Public Service Reform was made clear by the decision to establish a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a Cabinet Minister dedicated to driving the reform agenda.  This has placed Public Service Reform at the centre of government.  For the first time, functions and responsibility in relation to the reform of the Public Service are reflected on a statutory basis.  We have established a dedicated Reform and Delivery Office in my Department to oversee and drive the reform programme.</P>
        <P>Of course, the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform plays a central role in ensuring that reforms are focused and milestones achieved.  We have also put in place various other governance and support structures to ensure implementation across all sectors of the Public Service. In terms of expenditure targets, it is clear from the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i> published on 5th December last, the <i>Capital Infrastructure Plan</i> published on 10th November 2011 and the Implementation Body publication of the Public Service Agreement<i> Progress Report</i>   on the 17th November 2011 that the Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government Programme, in terms of both bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the Public Service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.  The Government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to its targets and is confident that these targets will be met.</P>
        <P>I should also mention the new &ldquo;Performance Budgets&rdquo; initiative which I launched last week.  This initiative heralded a completely reformed budgetary process where information is used and presented in a modern and accountable manner.  This will allow for the D&aacute;il to be fully involved in expenditure policy and to hold Ministers and public service managers to account for their spending.  As part of this process, last month I wrote to the Chairs of all of the D&aacute;il Select Committees, inviting them to start engaging straight away with Ministers and Departments on the expenditure allocations for 2013.</P>

        <P>I announced on 10th November 2011, in the context of unveiling the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016, that the Government has decided to review a number of options regarding the future of the National Lottery.  My Department is currently <Col N="115"/>examining the various options with respect to the next Lottery licence and I expect to be in a position to revert to Government in a matter of weeks.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s intention is to seek a large upfront payment to the State as part of the arrangements for the new licence, with some of the payment to be used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Paediatric Hospital.  I would also stress that any new arrangements for the National Lottery will involve the continued provision of significant annual revenues from the Lottery for good causes.  However, in advance of a final decision by Government on how to proceed on the matter, it would be premature for me to speculate at this stage on possible terms for the next licence.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 105 together.</P><Col N="116"/>
        <P>Senior public service managers are accountable to the Oireachtas through their appearances before Select Committees and the Public Accounts Committee. They are also subject to rigorous independent examination of regularity, propriety and value for money by the Comptroller and Auditor General who carries out individual VFM examinations on the economy and efficiency with which a public body uses its resources. Public servants are also subject to wider scrutiny through the operation of the Freedom of Information legislation and the work of the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The <i>Public Service Management Act 1997</i>   requires Secretaries General and Heads of Office to prepare and report on Statements of Strategy, and makes them more directly responsible and accountable for the day-to-day management of their Departments/Offices.  Such responsibilities and accountability can in turn be assigned to other officials.</P>
        <P>The Statements of Strategy set out clearly the high-level objectives against which the performance of Departments and other public service organisations will be assessed.  In particular, the annual Estimates of Expenditure for 2012 have now been re-cast to ensure full alignment with the Statements of Strategy, and to include performance information against each of the high-level objectives (or strategic &ldquo;programmes&rdquo;).  This approach, referred to as &lsquo;performance budgeting&rsquo;, was piloted successfully for the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture Groups of Votes in 2011, and has now been rolled out generally for the 2012 Revised Estimates which were published last Thursday, 23 February.  These new Estimates present an unprecedented volume of information on the performance of Departments and Offices &mdash; with particular focus on policy implementation by reference to outputs and impacts &mdash; and will provide new tools for D&aacute;il Select Committees in their scrutiny role with regard to the annual expenditure allocations.  The overall intention, in line with Government Programme commitments, is to heighten the focus upon overall performance and delivery by Departments and Offices, and improve accountability by office-holders for the achievement of results.</P>
        <P>The Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) which applies in the Civil Service places a strong emphasis on individual performance and accountability through the setting of goals and the monitoring of performance.  The integration of this system with other Human Resource processes increases the level of accountability for individuals.  My Department has recently introduced changes to PMDS that streamline the process and make it a more useful tool for the management of performance.  My Department will continue to review the effectiveness of performance management and develop new ways to strengthen management capability.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, on the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments.  Work is ongoing in my Department in this area.  I remain committed to bringing forward the reform required in the context of commitments on accountability arrangements, as set out in the Programme for Government.  Legislative change to clarify accountability arrangements is a key initiative of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan that was published in November 2011.</P>

	<P>Public infrastructure is funded primarily in two ways at the moment:  Exchequer financing (the vast bulk of funding) and PPP-sourced funding for particular projects that are suited to the PPP approach while providing value for money for the State. Since the publication of the &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;, my Department has intensified its engagement in a series of initiatives to maximise the sources of funding available for infrastructure investment. Some of these initiatives could provide lower-cost and/or longer-term substitution for existing sources of Exchequer borrowing for the Exchequer capital programme; some relate to financing solutions to close existing PPP deals; and some involve seeking new sources of private financing for public investment including via PPPs.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaging with both the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Bank (CEB) with a view to securing funding for a number of Exchequer funded capital projects including the Schools Building programme and the Water Services programme. I appreciate the support expressed by both institutions and the confidence shown by them in offering long term funding for important Irish infrastructure developments. This funding will not be additional to that provided for in the Medium Term Investment Framework but will provide funding on more favourable terms than are otherwise available to the State.</P>
        <P>We are also continuing to pursue the PPP approach to deliver public infrastructure alongside more traditional procurement, where it makes sense and offers value for money. Of course I acknowledge that the private funding market for PPPs is very challenging. Bank credit is in short supply internationally; our sovereign debt situation presents its own difficulties. I am very open to hearing proposals that might provide a workable solution to those difficulties. My Department has been actively engaging with private institutional investors to see whether it might be possible to match our immediate funding requirements for projects with their long term income stream needs. My Department is also in consultation with our European counterparts to explore best practice and similar initiatives in other jurisdictions like the UK.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with my Department, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) is working to progress pipeline PPP projects and to help unlock potential private sector investment.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently laid out our five year capital investment programme in <i>Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016.</i>    This publication which was the result of a major review of capital expenditure, prioritises investment in that infrastructure which will be most beneficial to supporting economic growth, thereby supporting sustainable employment growth in the medium term, meets urgent social needs and maintains our existing stock of infrastructure.  </P>
        <P>The programme protects supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years and in 2012 delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. While the overall capital envelope for 2012 has been reduced, we have actually held the level of capital allocation for the enterprise sector relative to the preceding period.</P>
        <P>The State will be spending some &euro;17 billion over the next five years on capital projects throughout the country and this will help support employment in many key areas. Much of this investment will be in smaller scale locally based projects, such as local and regional road maintenance and improvement, or school building and repair.  It is important to note that less expensive re-fit, refurbishment, and up-grade works can be more labour-intensive than larger capital-intensive projects that have been deferred.</P>

	<P>The Central Statistics Office applies the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the associated international rules for determining the appropriate classification to the recording and compilation of official underlying cause of death statistics.  The ICD classification is broadly based on the aetiology rather than the manifestation of diseases and gambling is not catered for as a category within this internationally agreed classification. Under EU law (Commission Regulation No. 328/2011 on Causes of Death) the CSO is legally obliged to codify underlying cause of death statistics to the ICD classification.</P>

	<P>As I have previously reported to this House, the decision to close the Irish Embassy in Iran was taken following a review of overseas missions carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which gave particular attention to the economic return from bilateral missions.  In light of the current pressures on public finances, the Government decided that the low volume of trade over a prolonged period did not justify maintaining a resident diplomatic Mission in Teheran. Ireland will continue to have full diplomatic relations with Iran and the Government intends to seek the appointment of a non-resident Ambassador. The Government remains committed to maintaining and developing our relations with Iran including, to the extent that it may be possible, in the economic area.</P>

I will also hold a number of meetings and consultations as part of the ongoing review of the White Paper on Irish Aid.   During the visit I will meet with Ministers and senior officials of the Government of Malawi, as well as representatives of Non-Governmental and civil society groups.     I will discuss a wide range of bilateral and international issues and I will of course raise our concerns on a number of human rights issues, including the matter referred to in the question. I fully share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in relations to the events of July 2011.  At the time, with our EU colleagues, and through European Union High Representative, Catherine Ashton, we strongly condemned the use of excessive force against protesters by the Malawian authorities and the actions taken to prevent citizens from exercising their Constitutional right to demonstrate peacefully.  The EU called on the people and the Government of Malawi to remain committed to the principles of democracy and to resolve disagreements through peaceful means.    Since the <Col N="125"/>violent incidents of last July, the Government of Malawi has entered into a dialogue with civil society representatives, which is ongoing.  </P>
        <P>The Government attaches the highest importance to human rights issues.  Discussion of human rights issues is a key feature in our dialogue with other countries, including the priority countries for our aid programme, of which Malawi is one.  Through our Embassy in Lilongwe, we are monitoring the situation in Malawi closely, and maintaining a strong dialogue with the Government and civil society locally, along with our EU partners.  I look forward to engaging in dialogue on these issues during my visit and to assessing the situation first hand.</P>

	<P>As Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE for 2012, I presented the priorities for our Chairmanship to the OSCE&rsquo;s Permanent Council in Vienna on 12 January.  These involve a lot of policy objectives and thematic concerns across the full range of the OSCE&rsquo;s work but do not include a list of specific country priorities.  Western Balkan issues are, however, of ongoing interest within the OSCE.   Within the OSCE&rsquo;s Human Dimension, which relates to human rights and democratisation, the Irish Chairmanship will be prioritising the issue of internet freedom.  Governance is the central theme for the Economic and Environmental Dimension, including efforts to combat corruption and money laundering.  In terms of the Politico-Military Dimension, the Irish Chairmanship is working to help facilitate progress in the resolution of the OSCE region&rsquo;s protracted conflicts, drawing on lessons learned from the Northern Ireland peace process.  We are also prioritising progress on updating the OSCE&rsquo;s confidence and security-building measures and on enhancing the conflict prevention capacity of the organisation.</P>

Following consideration of the financial and human resource implications, for the Department and for Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York, it was decided that youth delegates would not be included in the official delegation and this remains the position.   As a time when public finances are under pressure, it is important that the UN Third Committee, which deals with youth affairs, is serviced effectively and efficiently. While I appreciate the perspective that youth delegates may bring, the priority for the coming years is to ensure adequate staffing by officials with expertise in Third Committee matters.</P>

	<P>I have made very clear here in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere my views of the continued expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, which I now believe constitute the single biggest impediment to peace in the Middle East. Settlement expansion inherently involves seizure of Palestinian lands and dispossession of Palestinian families. It weakens &mdash; and is intended to weaken &mdash; the ability of Palestinian leaders to engage in peace talks, it creates facts on the ground which deliberately complicate the task of reaching a peace agreement, and it risks provoking violent Palestinian reaction on the ground.   Through our Missions in the area, Ireland and our EU partners try to follow the deliberately opaque and secretive processes involved. The nature and level of our reaction to these events is the subject of constant discussion, and varies from case to case. The village of Kafr Qaddum has become emblematic of the issues of land seizure and access through the resistance and demonstrations of the villagers. The most recent incident there, in which settlers were protected by Israeli forces while seizing land, is a frequent occurrence there and elsewhere in the West Bank.</P>
        <P>In the course of my visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories last month, I made clear my views on the settlement process directly to Israeli leaders at a very senior level, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, Deputy Prime Minister Meridor, and Foreign Minister Liberman. Ireland also supports Israeli and Palestinian NGOs which are helping to fight these land seizures through the courts.</P>

	<P>Ireland is currently a candidate for electionto the United Nations Human Rights Council for the period 2013-2015.   The Government&rsquo;s policy on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is primarily a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is the intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does <Col N="129"/>not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</P>
        <P>The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee&rsquo;s request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has independently assessed the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</P>
        <P>One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current D&aacute;il session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 and accession negotiations were formally opened in July 2010. In its most recent annual Progress Report on Iceland, published last October, the Commission noted the high level of progress on the negotiations due to Iceland&rsquo;s already highly integrated structures, its membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen Zone, and its high calibre public administration.    The accession process is currently in the screening phase, during which the Commission assesses the degree of compatibility of Iceland&rsquo;s laws with those of the EU. Screening reports have been delivered so far on 31 of the 35 so-called &ldquo;Chapters&rdquo; &mdash; specific areas of the acquis &mdash; and, due to Iceland&rsquo;s degree of alignment with EU law, negotiations on specific areas have been launched (eleven in total to date).  It is expected that a further number of Chapters will be opened for negotiations at the next Intergovernmental Conference with Iceland, to be held in March. </P>
        <P>Based on our close relationship with Reykjavik and on our own positive experience of enlargement in the past, Ireland supports the EU candidacy of Iceland. In this regard, we have been keen to offer advice and assistance when requested and Iceland would appear to find the Irish experience of particular relevance and value.</P>
        <P>My Department facilitated a study visit to Dublin by an Icelandic accession team covering Common Foreign and Security Policy in October last year and provided a briefing session to an accession team covering Fisheries who visited Dublin the following month.  A similar study visit focusing on our Lisbon referendum experience by a team of policy advisors from the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs took place in October 2010. More recently, Minister of State Creighton travelled to Iceland in October last year for meetings with Foreign Minister Skarph&eacute;ðinsson and senior officials from the various Ministries on the accession dossier and overall bilateral relations. The Minister and officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also held discussions with the Icelandic Chief Negotiator for EU Accession on his recent visit to Ireland 15-16 February.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>The fisheries sector remains extremely important for Iceland&rsquo;s economy, as indeed it is for our own, and will be an area of sensitivity. These matters will be addressed in detail under the fisheries Chapter of the accession negotiation framework and officials from my Department liaise closely with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are safeguarded in negotiations.  In the meantime, parallel work will continue on the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, to which Ireland actively contributes.</P>
        <P>Accession is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted with precision. There are areas where differences between Icelandic law and EU law still exist and these areas, which include fisheries, will present challenges during the negotiations. Ireland has and will continue to play an active role in protecting our own and the EU&rsquo;s interests with regard to negotiations with Iceland. In this regard we look forward to working closely with Iceland, with the European Commission and with our fellow Member States to ensure a satisfactory and mutually beneficial outcome to the Icelandic accession negotiations.</P>

	<P>All Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) which receive funding from Irish Aid to support their work in developing countries are required to submit annual, externally audited accounts, and to publish these audited accounts on their organisational website. These audited accounts include details on the salary levels paid to senior staff, including chief executives and senior officials. As part of the external audit process in each organisation, the Board of Directors signs off on the audited accounts, including approval of remuneration for chief executives and other senior officials. Irish Aid places a very high priority on ensuring that sound corporate governance policies, including the effective functioning of the Board of Directors, are in place in organisations which receive public funds for their development work.  Three audits of major Irish NGOs have been undertaken in the past twelve months by the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which involved in-depth examination of the strength of the financial systems and corporate governance function.  Where shortcomings are identified, the Department works closely with the organisations concerned to strengthen the relevant function in line with independent best practice standards.  </P>
        <P>In addition to this audit work, all applications for Irish Aid funding from NGOs undergo detailed appraisal based on a standard set of criteria which include corporate governance, organisational efficiency and cost effectiveness.  This appraisal and the related audit information are central to funding decisions.</P>

	<P>The overarching objective of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is to contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the world.  To ensure that our assistance is effectively delivered to those most in need in developing countries, we work in partnership with Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations and European Union.  Our aid programme is strongly concentrated on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>Through the overseas aid programme the Government provides assistance to over ninety countries worldwide. Nine have been designated as Programme Countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia.</P>
        <P>Working with and through government systems in our Programme Countries is essential if the improvements put in place are to be sustainable and the primary responsibility for promoting and fostering development rests with governments. Our partnerships with these countries place obligations on the recipient governments, including commitments to democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law and a willingness to combat corruption, and while working with and through governments, it is important to ensure that these governments are accountable both to their populations and donors. Towards this end, Irish Aid programmes are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Evaluation and Audit Unit receive and review the annual audited government accounts, prepared by national equivalents of the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General, for each of our Programme Countries.</P>
        <P>As part of our ongoing engagement in our Programme Countries we regularly monitor overall budgets, including defence spending. There are strict controls in place to ensure that Irish funds are spent only as agreed and are carefully tracked. This is done in various ways &mdash; through our own detailed auditing systems, through independent auditing arrangements and in conjunction with other donor partners.  Ireland also works in our Programme Countries to support programmes which build the capacity of national budget processes and strengthen public financial management systems and institutions of Government, such as the Auditor General function and relevant Parliamentary Committees, in order to eliminate waste and any misuse of funds.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to ensure that our funding is directed to those areas most in need, is used for the purposes intended and represents the best value for money.  We are committed to delivering on our commitment that all aid funded by the taxpayer will benefit the poorest and most vulnerable in the countries where we are working.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
        <P>As I have stated on previous occasions in this House, it remains the opinion of the Government that dialogue with the Government of Colombia, bilaterally and with our EU partners, offers the best way to further the objectives of supporting democracy and improving the human rights situation there.  I am aware of and share the concerns which have been expressed over human rights in Colombia, in particular the vulnerable position of trade unionists and human rights activists, as well as the very large number of Colombian people who were displaced (between two and three million) over the course of decades of conflict and terrorism.  It is for this reason that Ireland attached such importance to the human rights dimensions of the EU Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru during its negotiation, and will ensure that these are fully implemented when the Agreement enters into force.</P>
        <P>I met the Vice-President of Colombia, Angelino Garz&oacute;n when he visited Ireland last month, on 24 January. I conveyed the ongoing concerns of the Government of Ireland at reports of human rights abuses in Colombia. Vice-President Garz&oacute;n noted his Government&rsquo;s determination to address human rights abuses in Colombia. The Victims&rsquo; Rights and Land Restitution legislation (2011), which builds on the Justice and Peace Laws (2005) constitutes a crucial step in the efforts to push forward the peace process, and will, if fully implemented, provide reparation for more than four million victims of the long-standing armed conflict in the country.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to support the efforts of the Colombian government via our embassy at Mexico City, and with our partners in the European Union.</P>

	<P>The taxation and designation of marked gas oil for specific uses is in line with the EU Energy Taxation Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s environmental obligations.  In addition, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products, that they are acutely aware of the various illegal activities that lead to loss to the Exchequer of mineral oil tax and can have a harmful impact on the environment. The most serious risk in this regard is the large scale laundering of markers from mineral oil (diesel), and the onward supply and sale of the laundered product as auto diesel. Marked mineral oil is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.  The suggestion has been made that the present system of marking diesel for non-auto use should be replaced by one in which all diesel would be subject to the same rate of mineral oil tax, with repayment arrangements for certain users. A system of this kind would, however, give rise to additional administrative work for both the users concerned and for the Revenue Commissioners, would impose cash flow costs on users and could be open to fraud and abuse. The focus, therefore, is on strengthening the existing regime for taxing diesel at differential rates, including the implementation of enhanced licensing systems, acquiring a more effective marker, and continued robust enforcement action.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill 2012 proposes to enhance the supervision and control of the mineral oils supply chain by requiring that, in future, any person dealing in marked mineral oils will have to be licensed by the Revenue Commissioners to do so. It is envisaged that this important change will be complemented by amendments to the Mineral Oil Tax Regulations that will lay down new requirements for the recording and reporting of transactions by mineral oil traders.</P>

I understand that, in a recent Parliamentary Answer (Ref. 10447/12), the Minister for Social Protection indicated that her Department is currently examining the issues relating to the establishment of the Mortgage Advice Service and, as part of this, is also examining the efficiency, necessity and governance arrangements of this proposed service in the light of, inter alia, the role envisaged for Personal Insolvency Trustees as outlined in the Heads of a Personal Insolvency Bill as recently published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P><Col N="136"/>
        <P>As I announced in the Budget, a single Stamp Duty rate of 2 per cent will apply to non-residential property transactions executed on or after Budget night 6 December 2011.  I also announced a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) incentive for property purchased between 7 December 2011 and end 2013.  Where such property is held for seven years, the gain attributable to that seven year holding period will be relieved from CGT.</P>
        <P>The measures will facilitate greater activity within the property market, leading to additional employment and activity in related sectors.  They have been in place for less than three months so it is not possible to estimate how many jobs have resulted.</P>
        <P>A significant proportion of the Stamp Duty yield received since 6 December from commercial property transactions is likely to relate to transactions which predate the Budget change. It is too early at this stage to determine what impact the change will have on the level of activity or on the cost to the Exchequer.  It has been estimated that the Stamp Duty measure may cost in the region of &euro;64 million per annum, but it is possible that the new rate will encourage transactions which might not otherwise have taken place.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to project the extent of CGT relief under the incentive scheme, because the number of cases in which relief can be claimed is dependent on the number of properties purchased within the incentive period.  The relief will vary in every case depending both on the value of the property on its disposal and the date of that disposal.  No Exchequer cost will arise in respect of properties sold during the next seven years, because no relief can apply until a property is held for at least seven years.  As with the Stamp Duty measure, the incentive may lead to property acquisitions and disposals which might not otherwise have taken place.  The measures may also lead to additional taxes from other sources such as VAT and income tax from related employments, trades and professions.</P>

	<P>As part of the move to the greater use of shared services in the public sector in order to drive efficiencies, the Paymaster General&rsquo;s Office, which is part of my Department, took over the payment, on an agency basis, of pensions of the retired staff of the Vocational Education Committees. Payment of these pensions was previously made through the Local Authorities. The Paymaster General&rsquo;s Office pays all pensions fortnightly on relevant Thursdays for the previous two weeks in arrears. The Local Authorities also pay pensions fortnightly, but their period of payment is for the two calendar weeks and, therefore, would contain an element of advance at the point of payment. In transferring to the Paymaster General&rsquo;s system, this element of advance payment was eliminated in the first fortnightly payment of pension. Thereafter pensions are paid for two weeks in arrears. No pensioner loses out as a result.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that the Government has now fulfilled its commitment contained in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.  I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation mortgage interest relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.   The legislation is being amended for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if he or she made his or her first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if he or she drew down their mortgage in that period.  Therefore, an individual who drew down his or her mortgage in December 2008 but made his or her first mortgage interest repayment in 2009 will qualify for the increased relief. However, I do not intend to include mortgage sanctioned as a qualifying event for the purpose of the additional relief.</P>

	<P>The following are the current arrangements which apply in relation to the taxation of retirement lump sums paid under Revenue approved pension arrangements. These arrangements apply in both the public and private sectors and were introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Retirement lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of the Universal Social Charge (USC).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  (This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.)  No USC is chargeable.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed under Schedule E and collected under the PAYE system (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is also chargeable on the excess.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums taken since 7 December 2005 aggregating with later lump sums.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question asks for an estimate of the cost for 2012, in tax expenditure terms, of the tax-free retirement lump sums that will be paid this year on the assumption, presumably, that the amounts paid below the tax-free lifetime limit of &euro;200,000 would otherwise be taxed at the standard rate of income tax. As there is no general requirement for data on the number or value of retirement lump sums below the &euro;200,000 limit to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures in response to the question.</P><Col N="138"/>
        <P>However, as an indication and based on very broad assumptions about the numbers and average remuneration levels across the public service and assuming annual retirement trends of about 2.5%, it is estimated that the annual cost in tax foregone of not applying tax at the standard rate to tax-free retirement lump sums in the public service would be about &euro;100 million per annum.</P>
        <P>While the tax treatment of retirement lump sums apply in both the public and private sectors, I should point out that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware IBRC has been provided with a total capital contribution of &euro;34.6 billion. The Deputy will appreciate that much of the information requested in his question is subject to external factors and that it is not practical to be definitive in terms of timelines or costs at this point. Suffice to say that the Board of the bank is charged with the work-out of the bank&rsquo;s assets in a manner that will best protect the interests of the State.  However, the framework within which the bank is operating is set out in the EU Commission Decision on the restructuring plan which issued on 29.6 2011. The link below provides access the redacted version of the Decision.</P>
        <P>IBRC is working to generate options for the efficient work out of its loan books in accordance with the Bank&rsquo;s approved mandate. This includes examining accelerated disposal where this makes economic sense. Following the timely sale of the majority of the Bank&rsquo;s US loan portfolios, the bank now continues with further detailed analysis of the remaining loans in Ireland and the UK. This analysis will further inform the Board and management team of IBRC on the timing of the next phases of de-leveraging. The exact value of its remaining loans will be reported in the Bank&rsquo;s annual report and accounts which are due for release next month. The final cost of rescuing the institution is estimated to be within the current capital provided by the State and will predominately be a function of the property markets in Ireland and the UK together with the availability of counter-party liquidity to enable further disposals by way of recoveries, repayments and sales. It will also depend on the outcome of any negotiations on the promissory note between the Government and the EU that are still underway. The estimated timeframe for the resolution of the institution is currently nine years as detailed in the Bank&rsquo;s approved restructuring plans. <i>http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases/239466/239466_1251121_21_3.pdf</i></P>

This was based on a preliminary review carried out in September 2011. A further more detailed review was carried out in December/January based on the costs outturn for 2011. Taking this information into account, it is projected that annual costs in 2012 will be &euro;194m.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of &euro;30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of &euro;16-20bn over this period.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks&rsquo; deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The pillar banks <Col N="143"/>are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that both banks have reported to me that they have achieved their 2011 targets.  This information is currently being independently assessed by Mr John Trethowan of the CRO and will be dealt with in his quarterly report for end December 2011 which is due to be published shortly.  The function of oversight by the CRO applies to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  SMEs, sole traders or farmers can apply for a review where credit is refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions.  Banks have set up formal internal review processes, which must first examine an appeal by a customer.  Ulster Bank has also set up an internal appeal process.  The CRO ensures that the pillar banks do not refuse credit to viable businesses, both by its existence and by offering the right to a review of refusals.</P>
        <P>On 4 November last the Central Bank published a revised statutory Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME Code) setting out new requirements for lenders when dealing with SMEs in, or facing, financial difficulties which came into effect from 1 January 2012.  A full review of the SME Code will be undertaken in 2012.</P>
        <P>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation brought the draft heads of a Loan Guarantee Scheme Bill to Government on 24 November last.  The Scheme will provide a partial guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs.  This Scheme will be closely targeted at commercially viable, well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services which can demonstrate repayment capacity for the additional credit facilities but which cannot secure credit facilities due to either of the following two market failures:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities or,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Growth / expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Scheme is expected to go live in Quarter 2 of 2012 following enactment of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has also approved the establishment of a Micro Finance Loan Fund to provide loans on a commercial basis for start-up businesses and micro-enterprises.  It is expected that the businesses that will primarily benefit will be those at the margins of commercial lending decisions.  The Scheme will use an initial exchequer investment of &euro;10million to leverage further funds from private sources.  Over a ten year period, the scheme has the potential to provide up to &euro;100 million in additional lending to over 5000 micro-enterprises over that period.  The Scheme will be demand-led and the amount of funds provided will depend on the demand from viable businesses.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, I published the independent Mazars survey of SME credit late last year.  On foot of this report, a series of seven regional meetings with local representatives is now underway, hosted by the Minister for Small Business, John Perry T.D., supported by Mr John Moran, Head of Banking in the Department of Finance.  The aim of these meetings is to examine further the actions which might be taken by the Government to improve access to credit for SMEs.  All of these measures are, of course, underpinned by the initiatives outlined in the Government&rsquo;s recently published Action Plan on Jobs which recognises the importance that access to finance for SMEs will play in the implementation of strategies announced in the Plan.</P>

	<P>A review of NAMA was carried out by Mr. Michael Geoghegan in 2011 at the request of the NAMA Board and with my agreement.  In his report he made a number of proposals to the Board of NAMA including the appointment of a Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  These proposals were considered by the Board and, on 15th February 2012, NAMA announced a reorganisation of functions, the establishment of new divisions and a number of linked senior executive appointments which included the appointment of a CFO.  I am advised by NAMA that, to date, the role of the NAMA CFO has, in effect been carried out by NTMA&rsquo;s Director of Finance, Technology and Risk, through arrangement under section 41 NAMA Act, 2009 whereby the NTMA provides certain business and support services, including financial reporting services to NAMA.  However, the heavy workload associated with the Director&rsquo;s other NTMA responsibilities means that it has become necessary to split the functions.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the changes in structure and responsibility at a senior level in the Agency including the appointment of a CFO will ensure that NAMA is correctly positioned for the challenges ahead and that it will enable NAMA to focus its full attention on the management of its portfolio of assets and on maximising recovery of funds for the taxpayer.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would point out that the estimated additional yield from a 2% increase in the standard rate of VAT for 2012, as announced in my Budget 2012 speech, is &euro;560 million.  The estimate of &euro;670 million relates to receipts from the 2% increase in a full year.  These estimates were calculated by applying a direct increase of 2% to the expected yield from the 21% rate of VAT in 2011.  They are &ldquo;static&rdquo; estimates in that they do not take into account any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of the rate change.  However, the projection for personal consumption in 2012, upon which the Budget 2012 VAT forecast is primarily based, takes account of the rate change along with other factors affecting household spending (such as uncertainty and balance sheet rebuilding).  The Budget 2012 forecast for VAT receipts, at &euro;9,995 million, represents a &euro;254 million or 2.6 per cent increase on the 2011 outturn. </P>
        <P>Furthermore, the standard VAT rate was increased in the Budget as part of a general package of raising revenues measures to contribute to Exchequer funding and is in line with commitments made in the Programme for Government and in the EU/IMF Programme.  As I said when I addressed the D&aacute;il last December, the Government carefully considered the various options open to us in terms of taxation.  One of the key objectives of the Government is to get people back to work.  Indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on economic activity and <Col N="145"/>employment, which is why Budget 2012 focused on indirect taxes such as VAT rather than on income tax.</P>

	<P>The most recent estimate of the accounting value of the NAMA loan portfolio is as provided for in the NAMA accounts for the third quarter of 2011.  This is available on the NAMA website, <i>www.nama.ie</i>.  I am advised by NAMA that due diligence on all of the acquired loans is not yet complete so it is not in a position to provide the final breakdown of the data requested.  However, based on a preliminary analysis of the property assets securing its loans (assets valued by reference to the November 2009 valuations) 56 per cent of such assets are located in Ireland; 34 per cent in Britain; 4 per cent in Northern Ireland and the remaining in Europe and the US.  Based on the November 2009 valuation, the value of Irish property assets would be of the order of &euro;18bn, the value of British property assets would of the order of &euro;11bn; Northern Ireland property assets of the order of &euro;1.3bn and residual Europe and US assets of about &euro;1.7bn. </P>
        <P>NAMA&rsquo;s Board has a mandate under the NAMA Act to achieve the best financial return for the State.

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that provisions covering the Travel Agents Margin Scheme are contained in Section 88 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  This scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the <Col N="147"/>EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.  Detailed discussions with the travel industry were carried out prior to the introduction of the scheme.  The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers.  Travel agents covered by the scheme are liable to VAT on their margin on the services provided rather than the full consideration they receive in respect of the supply of these services.    </P>
        <P>The nature of the scheme means that the travel agent only has an obligation to account for VAT on the margin in the country where he/she is established.  The travel agent has no further VAT obligations in places where the travel services are supplied.  The travel agent cannot recover any VAT charged when he/she purchases the travel services but this is because VAT is only accounted for on the margin when the services are supplied on to the traveller.  There is no double taxation.  The Scheme is a standard EU-wide Scheme and is in operation in most Member States of the EU.</P>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, to those who meet certain disability criteria.  The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</P>

	<P>Sections 472A and 88A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide for the Revenue Job Assist scheme which provides tax incentives for both employers and employees to help the long-term unemployed return to employment.  Both incentives apply in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The requirement to be unemployed for at least 12 months helps to target the relief at those who can find it more difficult to secure employment because of the extended period for which they have been out of work.  It also protects the Exchequer from the potential for significant deadweight costs that would be associated with making the relief available for all individuals on the live register that subsequently obtain employment. </P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that I have decided to extend the scheme so that individuals signing solely for credits with the Department of Social Protection can also qualify for the relief, providing that all of the other governing conditions of the scheme are met.  This is provided for in Section 10 of Finance Bill 2012.</P>

In relation to the use of my car for Ministerial travel, the total cost has been &euro;90,065.42 for the period May &mdash; December 2011.  This cost included mileage (which is to cover car related expenses), the salaries paid to civilian drivers and the travel and subsistence paid to the drivers.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180, 188 and 275 together.</P>
        <P>In March 2011, the Government agreed new measures for Cabinet Ministers in relation to the provision of official transport to take effect from 1st May 2011.  Between the formation of the Government on the 9th March 2011 until the 30th, April 2011 each senior Minister was provided with a state car.  From the 1st, May 2011 in line with the revised procedures for cabinet ministers.  Ministers are now required to provide their own transport.</P>
        <P>As there is extensive travel involved in undertaking the duties of the office of Minister and Minister of State, and in line with the practice adopted by previous Governments, travel expenses are claimed at intervals by way of a statement provided by each Minister or Minister of State certifying the travel undertaken in connection with the office.  I am provided with two civilian drivers who are paid a wage of &euro;631.75 per week and any relevant subsistence allowance in respect of their official duties (the total subsistence paid in 2011 amounted to &euro;1,468.11). Between 1st May and December 2011 I claimed &euro;10,778.74 mileage expenses.  Minister of State Ciaran Cannon claimed &euro;21,465.82 mileage expenses between 9th March and 31st December 2011.  The basis on which Ministers record their mileage does not require them to list individual trips.</P>

        <Quest> if there are any circumstances in which a public sector worker in a school setting (details supplied) who wishes to stay on in his or her role despite having reached the retirement age of 65 years can be accommodated, taking into consideration that an arrangement has been made with the school in question and the person is willing to continue working; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The compulsory retirement date for a teacher reaching the age of 65 on 1st May, 2012 is 31 August 2012 where the teacher is not a new entrant under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  In the case of a person who is a new entrant within the meaning of that Act, there is no compulsory retirement age but a minimum pension age of 65 years.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the additional pressure of students facing state examinations, and the concerns of teachers who wish to ensure continuity of support for these children, I have made provision, for this year only, to reduce disruption to students undertaking State examinations in June.  This is in the form of alleviation measures allowing post-primary schools to re-employ teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012 and who, immediately before their retirement, have been teaching students preparing to sit the Junior or Leaving Certificate examinations in 2012.</P>
        <P>Circular 0031/2011, issued in May of last year, requires that schools prioritise registered teachers over unregistered persons and unemployed teachers over retired teachers when appointing teachers to substitute and fixed-term posts.  In particular, it prohibits schools from employing retired teachers to cover short-term absences unless all efforts to employ an appropriately qualified and registered teacher have failed.  This circular also requires a school principal to keep a record as to why a retired teacher had to be employed and to report to the school&rsquo;s board of management on the instances where this arises.</P>

	<P>My priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access to undergraduate higher education courses despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances. As a result, no changes were made to the eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in the recent Budget. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, in the context of the overall necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to any maintenance payment under the Student Grant Scheme. Existing postgraduate students will not be affected.</P>
        <P>However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level. This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. My Department estimates this will help an additional 4,000 postgraduate students. However, there will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.</P>
        <P>These measures will apply to all post-graduate students, regardless of where they reside. However, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need. Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.</P><Col N="155"/>
        <P>While it is regrettable that any changes need to be made to student support, I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students and allow us to maintain the high level of supports provided to undergraduate students.</P>

	<P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website. However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts. My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is <Col N="158"/>accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Staffing Circular 0007/2012, that is now published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board is 23 March, 2012.</P>

	<P>The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 devolved responsibility for the management of civil servants from the Government to Ministers and heads of office to reflect modern human resource practices.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which must be made in the coming years present challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education. Moreover, the projected growth in demand for higher education over the next two decades creates further challenges for funding. Careful planning and consideration of available evidence will allow us to develop policy options so that the system can meet those challenges in the difficult years ahead.</P>
        <P>At my request the Higher Education Authority (HEA) completed an initial study late last year on sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. The HEA report <Col N="159"/>outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers, and provides some evidence on the possible impacts of this on quality of provision. However, the HEA has emphasised that the report is preliminary only and that substantial additional work now needs to be undertaken before comprehensive proposals as to how we can sustainably fund higher education into the future can be developed. The HEA is continuing its work in this area and further advice is expected later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The main objective of the Student Grant Scheme is to provide assistance to students, who otherwise might not be able to afford to do so, to participate in further and higher education.  At third level, the grant supports eligible students in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in some cases, progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study.</P>
        <P>My priority as Minister for Education and Skills is to preserve access to undergraduate higher education courses despite the difficult circumstances in our public finances. As a result, no changes were made to the grant eligibility criteria for undergraduate students in Budget 2012. It is also worth emphasising that 41% of all undergraduate students currently receive a grant and pay no student contributions.</P>
        <P>In the context of the necessary but difficult expenditure reduction measures announced in Budget 2012, reductions in support for new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year had to be implemented.  However, those students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme.  In addition, a further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.</P><Col N="161"/>
        <P>In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level. This is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.  While it is regrettable that any changes need to be made to student support, I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students and allow us to maintain the high level of supports provided to undergraduate students.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and to the delivery of the goals and targets proposed. As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken. The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish. Only when these steps have been implemented, the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered. </P>
        <P>A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012. The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.</P>
        <P>Reviews of Irish will also be undertaken at other levels of the system in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy 2011-2020.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 225 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s policy is to promote the principle of inclusive education as envisaged in Section 2 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN), Act 2004.</P>
        <P>My Department, either directly or through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs which includes additional resource teachers, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and specialist equipment. The precise model of provision made will depend on the pupil&rsquo;s assessed disability.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate for the Deputy this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of resources for children with special educational needs.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>There has been no reduction in the number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) which will be available for the next school year, with 10,575 posts remaining available for allocation. It is considered that with equitable management and distribution of these resources that there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with my Departments criteria.</P>
        <P>Neither has there been any reduction in the overall number of resource teaching posts which will be available for allocation to mainstream schools for the next year, either through the General Allocation Model or which are available for individual allocation by the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>The fact that the number of special needs assistant and resource teaching posts are being maintained at current levels is a reflection of this Governments commitment to prioritising supports for children with special educational needs, at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. This commitment to protecting frontline services for children with special educational needs will ensure that the requirements of special needs pupils can continue to be provided for on an ongoing basis, despite overall budgetary pressures.</P>

	<P Just="Left">While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department&rsquo;s budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012.  The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Until now, a specific resource was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by that normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.</P>
        <P>All 195 second-level school in DEIS will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</P>
        <P>At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.</P>

	<P>With the implementation of universal pre-school provision, 94% of children are availing of a pre-school year in the year prior to enrolling in the primary school system.    As well as quality improvement in early years settings, my Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that there is a continuum of learning from pre-school through to the primary school system.  With this in mind, my Department funded the development of Aistear through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.   Aistear is a curriculum framework for children aged 0-6 and can be used by parents as well as by early years practitioners and by teachers in junior and senior infant classrooms.  Aistear has advanced considerably the thinking underpinning the infant stages of the Primary School Curriculum which is now being reviewed to reflect the approach to teaching and learning that is appropriate for young children from three to six years.</P>
        <P>To evaluate how children are experiencing a continuum of learning from pre-school to the junior infant classroom, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate will, in 2012,  be carrying out joint inspections with the HSE&rsquo;s pre-school inspectorate.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Disadvantage, was launched in May 2005 and remains the Department of Education and Skills policy instrument to address educational disadvantage. The action plan focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool through second-level education (3 to 18 years).  </P>
        <P>Concentrating resources in favour of schools serving the most disadvantaged communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils is consistent with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on Primary Disadvantage in 2006, which suggested that the Department of Education and Skills should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>DEIS includes a commitment for ongoing evaluation of the programme to ensure successful implementation and appropriate measurement of outcomes at both local and national level. The Educational Research Centre has undertaken this ongoing evaluation, on behalf of my Department, the aim of which is to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students and schools at primary and post primary levels.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Inspectorate of my Department conducted evaluations of planning in a sample of 36 DEIS schools, 18 primary and 18 post-primary. A national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post-primary schools has been completed and this report along with the ERC report were published in January 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department will fully consider these evaluation reports before any decisions can be made regarding the future of DEIS.   While a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage, the current economic climate and the challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure, particularly given the upward pressures on teacher numbers and in the context of operating <Col N="164"/>under a fixed ceiling on teacher numbers affords no capacity to provide for additionality to the DEIS programme.</P>

	<P>The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. In the context of a rapidly increasing school population and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.</P>
        <P>The policy of my Department on renting prefabricated accommodation in individual cases depends on a number of factors including:</P>
   <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />If the accommodation need is deemed short term, the policy is generally to approve temporary rental of accommodation. For example, a school may require a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of a permanent building.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Immediacy of requirement. In some cases, a school needs accommodation at very short notice and this can only be provided through temporary accommodation. In the past, that was provided by means of either rental or purchase of prefabricated buildings or the rental of other temporary accommodation such as local halls. My Department operates a policy of providing schools with the option of purchasing prefabs outright or providing a new build with the funding available where it is expected that the school will require the extra accommodation for more than three years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In general, the Board of Management of a school is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation, although this is not always the case. Where circumstances warrant, my Department procures the accommodation directly rather than through the school.  This would arise for instance in a case where my Department is the owner of the site in question and would therefore be the client for any capital works.</P>

	<P>In keeping with Government policy, a salary ceiling of &euro;200,000 will apply to future appointments to senior positions in the higher education sector.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of employees in the higher education sector who currently earn more than &euro;200,000 per annum are Academic Medical Consultants, remuneration for whom falls in the main within the remit of the Minister for Health.  Any changes to the terms and conditions of these consultants will have to be considered in the context of the Minister for Health&rsquo;s approach towards the remuneration of all medical consultants.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have written to the Chairpersons of the University Governing Bodies requesting them to ask those individuals who earn in excess of the pay ceiling of &euro;200,000, other than Academic Medical Consultants, to make voluntary <Col N="165"/>waivers of salary.  While two individuals have agreed to make personal arrangements with their employer regarding a deduction of the amount of salary in excess of &euro;200,000, to date there have been no voluntary waivers made for the benefit of the State.</P>
        <P>I cannot enforce a voluntary waiver nor can I insist that a waiver, if made, follows any particular format.  For example, if an employee chooses to waive a portion of his or her salary in favour of a charity or their employer they are free to do so.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214, 215, 249 and 254 together.</P>
        <P>There is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level.  However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools. As part of the Budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers.</P>
        <P>The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</P>
        <P>This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.  The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  They will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Staffing Circular that is now published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeals Board is 23 March 2012.</P>

	<P>The funding to which the Deputy refers is the arrangement whereby the salaries of teachers employed within the approved annual staffing allocation for fee charging schools by my Department are paid by the State; an arrangement that pre-dates the introduction of the Free Education scheme and which exists since the foundation of the State.  The estimated cost of these posts is in the order of &euro;100 million. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced a review last December, in the context of the Budget 2012, where I made a further one point change to the staffing allocation of fee charging schools. I indicated at the time that the purpose of the review would be to inform future policy in relation to exchequer support for these schools.</P>
        <P>The review will be completed in the coming months and in time to inform Government deliberations on the next budget.  The majority of fee paying schools have responded to a request from my officials seeking initial information regarding tuition fees charged for the academic year 2011/12. Reminders have issued to a small number of schools.  Once complete this information will enable a calculation of the gross income from tuition fees in respect of each school and it will be related to the exchequer resources foregone by each school because it is a fee charging school.</P>

	<P>In 2004 the Department invited the Council of Europe Language Policy Division to develop a Language Education Policy Profile for Ireland. The Council of Europe offers member States assistance in carrying out analyses of their language education policies with the assistance of a team of international experts. The Profile was published in 2007. It recommended that Ireland should develop a national languages strategy. Its remit would cover such areas as: the place and role of languages in society; possible scenarios for the integration of languages in the education system and the implications for curriculum development, teacher education, etc.; language provision at second level; structures or measures to provide ongoing advice on language policy.</P>
        <P>A Working Group has developed a draft languages policy for internal submission to the Department preparatory to a wider consultation phase.  In the meantime, policy is that two languages, Irish and English should be available from the beginning of primary schooling, that immersion approaches will be supported under which English may be delayed to the start of the second term in senior infants, that Irish will remain a compulsory subject in second level schools except for those with exemptions, and that the languages English, Irish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic will continue to be offered as part of the curriculum in schools in senior cycle.  There are no plans in the current budgetary situation <Col N="167"/>to extend the range of languages available as part of the curriculum in second level schools.  However, the availability of Transition Year and the option of school developed short courses proposed as part of junior cycle reform will provide  opportunities for schools to provide additional languages if they wish to do so.</P>
        <P>Students at third level have access to a wide range of foreign language courses which can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines, supported by the IOT Languages Strategy Network, and the Erasmus programme. The new Higher Education Strategy emphasises that higher education institutions need to actively engage with stakeholders in the communities they serve and this will be a key priority for implementation.  My Department and its agencies will continue to engage with industry to ensure that the education responds insofar as is possible to the emerging needs of enterprise in this area.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s policy on the development of preschool education is to raise the quality of provision through workforce development and through effective practice.  This is in line with the 2011 EU Commission&rsquo;s Communication COM (2011) 66 on &lsquo;Providing all our children with the best start for the world of tomorrow&rsquo;.    In terms of quality improvement, my Department has funded two practice frameworks &mdash; S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education which addresses all dimension of practice where children aged 0-6 are present and Aistear, the Curriculum Framework for Early Years (NCCA 2009).  My Department also published a Workforce Development Plan for the Sector in December 2010.</P>

	<P>I issued Circular 0031/2011 in May of last year.  One purpose of which is to ensure, as far as practicable, that schools prioritise unemployed teachers over retired teachers.  In particular, it prohibits schools from employing retired teachers to cover short-term absences unless all efforts to employ an appropriately qualified and registered teacher have failed. This circular also requires a school principal to keep a record as to why a retired teacher had to be employed and to report to the school&rsquo;s board of management on the instances where this arises.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, under Circular 0040/2011, teachers who are retired and who return to teaching are now remunerated at the first point of the revised salary scales applicable to new entrants. This represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching.</P>
        <P>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided for a reduction in the pay of public servants. Under the Public Service Pension Rights Order 2011 (S.I. No. 80 of 2011), 29 February 2012 was set as the final date on which public servants could retire and have their pension entitlements calculated on the older, higher rates.</P>
        <P>I am also seeking to reduce the impact of these retirements on students preparing for the State examinations. I am allowing schools to re-employ teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012, and who had been teaching classes due to sit State <Col N="168"/>exams in 2012, until the end of the school year.  These measures are confined to teachers teaching State examination classes in post-primary schools and do not apply to teachers with no exam classes or to primary school teachers. I am aware that there are a large number of qualified and registered teachers who are unable to source work at the current time. I am also very alive to the pressures our young people are under to perform well in their State exams. I believe that the approach being adopted strikes the right balance between the needs of students who face into significant examinations, the retiring teachers who have invested a huge amount of time and effort in preparing students for their examinations and those teachers who are looking forward to the opportunities presented by the increased level of retirements at a time of constrained resources.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department that only a teacher registered with the Teaching Council, and who has qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which he or she is proposed, should be employed in a school. Unregistered personnel should not be appointed except in exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting registered teachers have been exhausted and for quite restricted time periods. </P>
        <P>Circular 31/2011 issued last year by my Department sets down rules in this regard and is applicable to all appointments made on or after 1 September 2011. Schools are required to keep a list of appropriately qualified registered teachers who are available for substitute teaching at short notice. Teachers who are available for work may inform schools in their locality and be included on this list. Schools must then use this list or a service like Subsearch or TextaSub when they need a teacher at short notice.</P>
        <P>If a school cannot find an unemployed teacher in time, they may then employ a retired appropriately qualified registered teacher. If none is available, it may move on to employ a registered teacher whose qualifications are for a different sector or post giving preference, wherever possible, to an unemployed teacher over a retired one. If a school, despite its best efforts, cannot find a registered teacher it may, for a maximum period of one week, employ an unregistered person, provided that it is satisfied that the person is competent and capable to act in place of a teacher. A school must continue looking for an appropriately qualified registered teacher and, if it finds one in the meantime, the interim person must be let go.  Principals are obliged to keep a record and report to the board of management on instances where retired registered teachers and unregistered people are employed. Historical provisions allow for recognised non-graduate teachers of Rural Science, Woodwork, Metalwork, Art, Home Economics, Woodwork and Building Construction and Secretarial studies.  The Teaching Council also provides for the registration of teachers of certain non-graduate subjects in the Further Education Sector and the Post Primary Sector for VEC teaching only.</P>
        <P>From 2013 all applicants for registration with the Council will be required to hold, at a minimum, a level 8 award (degree level) on the National Framework of Qualifications.</P>

	<P>88.9% of junior cycle students sat science in the junior certificate examinations in 2011.  The main challenge relates to the low proportions who take the physical sciences, physics and chemistry, in senior cycle.</P>
        <P>In the context of junior cycle reform, which will begin implementation on a phased basis from 2014 onwards, all of the existing subjects are being continued, and Irish (except where there is an exemption), English and Mathematics will remain core full subjects. Schools will also have the option of providing locally developed short courses of 100 hours, supported by exemplars developed by the NCCA.</P>
        <P>All students will be required to achieve 24 statements of essential learning as part of their programme. These include describing, illustrating, interpreting, predicting and explaining patterns and relationships, developing an understanding of the natural world, and understanding the distribution of social, economic and environmental phenomena.  It will be a matter for schools to determine, from the range of subjects and short courses on offer, how these statements of learning will be met.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible. Good and enthusiastic science teachers have the opportunity to inspire a real interest in their subject and so ensure that pupils will want to sit the exam.</P>
        <P>It is particularly important that we ensure the reforms address the needs of those who are currently least served by the system, and that the changes do not lead to an erosion of the practical or vocationally oriented subjects in schools. Curricular choice has been shown to be an important factor in strengthening retention rates to completion of senior cycle in school.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that medical and therapy supports for children who are suffering from mental health problems are provided by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>My Department provides for Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for children who have care needs relating to an assessment of Emotional Behavioural Disorder (EBD) or Severe Emotional Behavioural Disorder (SEBD). SNA support is also provided in relation to students <Col N="170"/>who may have a disability diagnosis other than EBD or SEBD, but who may have been allocated care support for behavioural issues. In total, approximately 6,000 children in primary and post primary schools are currently being supported by some 4,500 SNAs either wholly or partly to address behavioural issues.</P>
        <P>Where children with a diagnosis of EBD or SEBD have consequential learning support needs, they also receive Resource Teaching support.</P>
        <P>Other supports which are available for schools to deal with emotional and behavioural difficulties include the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) in post primary schools and the support teacher scheme in primary schools.</P>
        <P>Schools are also supported by the National Educational Psychology Services. The National Educational Psychology Service has published &lsquo;Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &mdash; A Continuum of Support for Primary Schools &mdash; Guidelines for Teachers&rdquo; and intends to also shortly publish new Guidelines for schools for Supporting Students with Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties.</P>

        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. My Department&rsquo;s opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.</P>
        <P>In the light of the very difficult economic situation, and these significant costs, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.</P>
        <P>Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging. I will be considering how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act so as to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.</P>

        <P>The report provides data on 140 DEIS Band 1 and DEIS Band 2 schools which were identified as being impacted by the possible loss of posts. Where schools are adversely affected by Budget measures, the most significant losses can be attributed to the withdrawal of posts from previous disadvantaged schemes . The losses from other factors such as the change to the new staffing schedule for Band 1 schools, demographics or the new General Allocation Model are not as significant.</P>
        <P>The report indicates that the majority of schools, 107, would lose between 0.5-2 legacy posts while 22 schools would lose between 3 and 4 legacy posts, and a further 3 schools would lose more than 5 legacy posts. 8 schools would not lose any legacy posts.</P>
        <P>The full report with a list of the schools involved is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>In his address to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on December 5th 2011 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that Public Service bodies will have to achieve a reduction of 5% in the cost of allowances and premium payments in 2012.  In order to achieve the necessary reduction, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is conducting a review of allowances and premium payments across the Public Service.  Pending the outcome of this review, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised my Department that delegated sanction for the payment of allowances to new beneficiaries is withdrawn with effect from 1st February 2012.  The only exception to the prohibition on the awarding of new allowances is Principal and Deputy Principal Allowances.  I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will advise of the outcome of the review shortly.  I am not in a position to comment further in relation to teacher allowances until then.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 provides that there will be no reductions in the pay rates of existing public servants.  All teachers who were eligible to hold allowances prior to 1 February 2012 continue to be eligible for these allowances.  The provisions of the Public Service Agreement, including the delivery of the additional hours, form part of the terms and conditions of a teacher&rsquo;s contract of employment and as such it is expected that all teachers will continue to work in accordance with these provisions.</P>

VTOS participants who are in receipt of Job Seekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance are paid a weekly training allowance by the relevant VEC in lieu of their Department of Social Protection payment.  VECs obtain details from the Department of Social Protection of the payment that each participant is in receipt of and their VTOS training allowance is set at this rate for the duration of the programme.</P><Col N="176"/>
        <P>The VTOS participant referred to by the Deputy was in receipt of the personal rate of Job Seekers Benefit from the  Department of Social Protection when he joined the VTOS programme.

	<P>Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative in 2005. In January 2012, I asked my Department to report on the net effect, in terms of posts, of this Budget measure on DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes, pre-dating DEIS.  Following on from this analysis of the Budget measure, the Government agreed last week to retain 235 of these posts on a concessionary basis in DEIS Band 1 and DEIS Band 2 primary schools.</P>
        <P>As was announced on Budget Day, 20 of the legacy posts being withdrawn will be re-allocated for the purposes of providing the continuous professional development element of the Department&rsquo;s Literacy and Numeracy strategy which also has a focus on tackling disadvantage and is a key commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 251 together.</P>
        <P>The staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year are set out in Primary Circular 0007/2012 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.  The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools.  This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools.  A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs.  This should be completed by schools in March.</P>
        <P>There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools.  The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc. Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours.  The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.  All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher redeployment and recruitment and to reduce the impact of travel time between schools where teachers are shared.  My Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible.  As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</P>

	<P>The Report on the net impact , in terms of posts, of Budget measures on DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes, pre-dating DEIS was published on 21 February 2012.  Due to conflicting numbers of posts being reported as potentially lost to Band 1 and 2 schools it was necessary to obtain clarity with regard to the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools; for example, increasing and decreasing enrolments, the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process and up to date enrolments, all of which contribute to determining the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.  On foot of analysis of this report, the Government agreed to my proposal to retain these posts, on a concessionary basis, in DEIS Band 1 and DEIS Band 2 primary schools.  My Department&rsquo;s Social Inclusion Unit will now be writing to the schools concerned, and all DEIS Band 1 schools in relation to their staffing allocations for 2012/13 school year.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the standardisation of the mid-term, Christmas and Easter breaks for all schools.  The arrangements for the standardisation of these breaks are agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council and were first introduced in 2004 to implement a specific requirement in the national agreement Sustaining Progress.  Sustaining Progress set the achievement of a standard school year as a requirement for all primary and post primary schools in the country.  In encompassing all schools in both sectors it was designed to bring certainty and clarity on a country wide basis to the arrangements for the vacation periods covered by the agreement.  The current agreement covers the breaks for Christmas, Easter and mid-term in the first and second terms for the school years up to 2013/14 and is set out in Circular 0034/2011 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>The major building project at the school referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  The Design Team are currently working on finalising the Stage 2(b) Submission (Detailed Design and Tender Documents) which will then be forwarded to my Department for review.  Thereafter, officials from my Department will be in contact with the Board of Management with regard to the further progression of the project.  The Department will shortly publish an outline five year programme on the projects to be constructed in that time.  The school building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project at Clifden Community School, will be considered in the context of that programme, taking into account the funding available, the building costs involved and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed by school Boards of Management, on behalf of the school patrons or trustees, and it is the Board of Management that employ the teachers at the school.  Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</P>
        <P>In dealing with parental complaints, my Department&rsquo;s role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities.  The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.  Where a parent feels that the school&rsquo;s board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child. The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail <i>oco@oco.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>In his address to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on December 5th 2011 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that Public Service bodies will have to achieve a reduction of 5% in the cost of allowances and premium payments in 2012. In order to achieve the necessary reduction, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is conducting a review of allow<Col N="182"/>ances and premium payments across the Public Service.  Pending the outcome of this review, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised my Department that delegated sanction for the payment of allowances to new beneficiaries is withdrawn with effect from 1st February 2012.  The only exception to the prohibition on the awarding of new allowances is Principal and Deputy Principal Allowances.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will advise of the outcome of the review shortly.  As Minister for Education and Skills I am conscious of the difficulties that the current situation imposes on schools, particularly in regard to the filling of Assistant Principal positions.  The position is that schools may continue to appoint persons to Assistant Principal posts, where they have the approval of my Department to do so.  However, because of the withdrawal of the sanction to pay allowances to new beneficiaries, an allowance for such a post may not be paid.  This position has been communicated to the school.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my response to his question of 21 February, 2012, the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </P>
        <P>My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can <Col N="188"/>be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>
        <P>In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>

        <Quest> the number and costs of advertisements placed in national newspapers for job vacancies in the civil and public service in the past 12 months; the number of new entrants recruited from the process; the number of vacancies filled from inside the civil and public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The table outlines the costs of advertisements placed by my Department in national newspapers for job vacancies in the civil and public service since January 2011.  My Department, through the Public Appointments Service (PAS) placed an advertisement in the print media in December 2011 inviting applications for the position of primary and post primary inspectors. To date no appointments have been made arising from this process.  In the period in question no vacancies in my Department have been filled from within the civil and public service. In line with Government policy my Department must carry out its functions within staffing levels assigned to it by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (PER)  in accordance with the Employment Control Framework (E.C.F.).</P>
        <P>I should point out that the recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998. Costs for advertising are paid from the schools&rsquo; capitation grants and an individual breakdown of costs is unavailable to the Department.   As of 1st January 2009, all advertising of teaching posts at primary level has been on one of five listed websites which include sites run by the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN) and the management bodies.  Web-based advertising was extended to all special needs assistant positions at primary level as of 1st December 2011.  Vacancies for the post of principal may also be advertised on <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>. Schools at post-primary level are currently required to advertise teaching posts in the national press.  The Department is currently liasing with the relevant bodies at post primary level with a view to advertising all teaching posts on-line for the 2012/2013 school year:</P>

	<P>This school is currently provided with a satellite connection the Schools Broadband Access Programme. There have been two attempts to provide this school with a DSL (fixed line) connection, however both attempts failed because of the distance between the school and the Eircom exchange, DSL connectivity is only possible within a certain distance of an exchange. The contracts for connectivity under the Schools Broadband Access Programme are currently being re-tendered. In re-tendering these contracts, every effort has been made to try and encourage as many small providers as possible to respond. Following this process, it is hoped that there will be a significant reduction in the number of schools reliant on satellite connections. At this point, it is not possible to comment on what type of connection will be provided to Culmullen NS under the new contracts.  </P>

Unused hours from any given week cannot transfer to a subsequent week.</P>
        <P>The case to which the Deputy refers has been reviewed by officials in my Department.The terms of the scheme were not adhered to by the person in question, due to the family taking a holiday in the first two weeks in July. The maximum grant aid of 20 hours was issued therefore, for the tuition  provided in the last two weeks of July.</P>

	<P>As I mentioned in previous replies in relation to proposals to amend the Valuation Act 2001, significant work has already been done by the Commissioner of Valuation and by my officials on the formulation of a Bill to streamline and improve the valuation system. The Government has approved the Heads of an amending Bill and these are now with the Parliamentary Draftsman&rsquo;s Office for drafting of the Bill.  Subject to such technical adjustments as may be found necessary in the course of drafting, the Bill will be published and processed as soon as possible as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall legislative programme.</P>
        <P>The proposed provisions will modernise the valuation legislation and cater for such technical changes as have been found necessary in the light of practical experience with its operation since 2001. It will streamline a number of areas such as the operation of the system for appeals against valuations.   Significantly, the proposed legislation will facilitate a speeding up of the national revaluation programme being undertaken by the Valuation Office. As part of this, the proposed legislation will contain provisions to allow new options for revaluation, including the introduction of a Self Assessment approach, accompanied by appropriate controls, and for outsourcing some of the work. I understand that schemes to pilot these options in two local authority areas are being drawn up by the Valuation Office in parallel with the drafting of the enabling legislation.</P>

        <Quest> if he will instruct all Departments, State agencies and local government bodies to include, as a matter of course, appropriate social clauses in all public procurement contracts for supplies, services and construction to enhance the prospects of Irish, regional and local-tenders securing said contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The rules onawarding public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement for employment of long term unemployed, as a condition in the performance of the contract.  Any such provision must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, as appropriate.  I understand that the National Procurement Service is currently looking at developing guidance for contracting authorities in relation to the use of such social clauses. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation for national coastal protection is included in Flood Risk Management <Col N="193"/>capital allocation of the Office of Public Works (OPW), which for 2012 is &euro;45m. It is expected that expenditure of the order of &euro;200,000 will be spent on the Irish Coast Protection Strategy Study during 2012.   OPW does not have an application from Fingal County Council in relation to the area in question. An application was received in 2009 under the Minor Works scheme and was rejected as it did not meet the scheme&rsquo; criteria.  Any application received will be assessed in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, in conjunction with other applications received and having regard to the overall availability of resources. </P>

	<P>Since 1 May 2011 Cabinet Ministers with the exception of Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform now use their own cars.  All Ministers are now paid for official mileage up to 96,540 kilometres or 60,000 miles per annum. Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984.  My Department does not maintain records of the travel costs for each Minister, However, at the time the change was made last year it was estimated that the annual savings from Cabinet Ministers using their own cars rather than using State ones would be of the order of &euro;4 million.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views that while, for the past number of years, each Department with responsibility for expenditure that is part funded by the National Lottery surplus published information concerning such expenditure on their website, the reality is that no Department publishes a consolidated compendium of its National Lottery expenditures &mdash; on its website or otherwise &mdash; and the considerable changes in Department structures, titles, staffing and responsibility in the course of 2011 make it a practical impossibility for a lay person, even with access to departmental websites; if he will identify the way National Lottery funds were expended in recent years, geographically, thematically or otherwise; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I have outlined in replies to previous questions, the allocation of funding from subheads which are part-funded by the surplus from the National Lottery is the responsibility of a number of Government Departments and Agencies. These Departments and Agencies are listed each year in Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV).  In recent years, funding raised by the Lottery has only part-funded the subheads with the balance coming from the exchequer.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the distribution of Lottery funding <i>per se</i>. </P>
	<P Just="Left">I note the Deputy's comments on the accessibility of the information she was seeking and I am making sure that Departments are fully aware of the requirement that they publish the appropriate details on their websites.</P>

	<P>The statistics requested by Deputy Nulty are not available, as they are not collated centrally. The National Procurement Service (NPS), based in the Office of Public Works, is responsible for eProcurement and for the operation of the eTenders public procurement portal (<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>). On average 5000 tenders for the procurement of goods, services and works are advertised on eTenders every year.  The overall procurement spend by the public sector amounts to an estimated value of between &euro;14 and &euro;16 billion per year.</P>
        <P>Since 2009, the NPS has been responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and providing these statistics to the European Commission. The thresholds valid from January 2010 to December 2011 above which tenders must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The information that is available currently for the years 2006-2010 relates to above-EU threshold contracts only and is contained in the tabular statement below.  Data in respect of 2011 will not be available until later this year.  The Deputy should be aware that the figures contained in the table relates to the number of contracts placed which were above the EU Threshold for the year in question and must not be interpreted as indicative statistics for the overall procurement spend.  It must also be borne in mind that these statistics relate only to above threshold procurements, where contract award notices were published, and where the nationality of the winning tenderer was disclosed. In the case of all public service contracts with a value of &euro;10,000 or more (inclusive of VAT) within a 12 month period, the contractor is required to provide a valid tax clearance certificate before payment can issue.</P>
        <P>For example, when considering the year 2009, &euro;2.8 billion worth of expenditure was advertised in the Official Journal; out of the &euro;15 billion public procurement spend in that year.  Of this &euro;2.8billion, 12% went to non-domestic companies.  The NPS estimates that less than 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers, as a significant proportion of the overall procurement spend is below the EU threshold and is also below the threshold for advertising on eTenders (the eTenders threshold was &euro;50,000 in 2009).</P>
        <P>The figures for 2008 are broadly similar, but indicate that a higher number of above-threshold tenders were advertised in the OJEU.  The EU Commission has agreed that the figures for 2008 can be taken to indicate, &ldquo;about 95% of all procurement by value was from domestic suppliers&rdquo;.</P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>It should be noted that the statistics do not distinguish between companies in the UK and those based in Northern Ireland, so of the contracts going &ldquo;abroad&rdquo;, many of the contracts may have stayed on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted also that all the statistics relating to non-domestic suppliers relate to suppliers with an address in countries other than Ireland and do not distinguish between European and non-European suppliers.</P>
        <P>In a recent survey conducted by the National Procurement Service and sent to all registered suppliers on eTenders 20% of respondents said that they had won public procurement contracts in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and 15% said that they had won public procurement contracts in other member states.</P>

        <P>Following the Independent Adjudicator&rsquo;s decision of September 2010 under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Defence Forces, clarification was provided by the Adjudicator that the reports which found in favour of certain PDFORRA claims could not be implemented while the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009 was in place.  This remains the position.</P>
        <P>In addition it should be noted that all parties to the Public Service Agreement 2010-201, including PDFORRA, have agreed that no cost-increasing claims for improvement in pay or conditions of employment will be made or processed during the currency of the Agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 293 together.  </P>
        <P>It is a matter for each sector to manage potential service delivery issues arising from retirements to end-February and beyond. Questions as to how these issues are being managed should most appropriately be addressed to the relevant Minister. As the Deputy is aware, sectoral Transition Teams have been put in place to deal with the specific short-term challenges arising from the ending of the grace period. The reports from these Teams indicate that they have given due consideration to the impact of staffing reductions on the various sectors and the most fitting and expeditious ways of managing these. As they have the most current information on service provision at a local level, each sectoral Transition Team has been directed to actively communicate with the public via whichever means appropriate in order to allay concerns with regard to critical frontline service delivery. Public concerns about service levels should be addressed proactively and the public should be kept informed of business continuity arrangements that are in place. In the case of the civil service, material from the Transition Team process is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://per.gov.ie/civil-service-sectoral-plan/ </i>.</P>
        <P>Beyond the February 2012 grace period deadline, the Strategic Workforce Planning Groups in each sector will continue to ensure that sectoral employers develop plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the outflow of staff in 2012 and future years on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, and 295 together.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body for the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014   (or &lsquo;Croke Park Agreement) published its first Annual Progress Report in June 2011. The Report examined the savings and reform delivered in the first year of the Agreement and found that sustainable pay bill savings in the order of &euro;289m had been achieved during the review period.  It also reported that &ldquo;solid and measurable&rdquo; progress was being made on implementing the Action Plans for reform in each sector, while pointing to certain issues that needed to be accelerated over the next reporting period.</P>
        <P>An interim report published by the Body in November provided evidence of further progress on the delivery of change and reform across the public service under the Agreement over the <Col N="199"/>period April to September 2011.  The second annual review of the Agreement is scheduled to take place after Easter and will assess the savings achieved in the second year of the Agreement.  As before, it will also scrutinise the level of progress being made on implementing the reform programmes in each sector.  I look forward to the outcome of that review which I expect will be published shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Government has stated that it wishes to honour the commitments given under the Agreement, namely that there would be no further reductions in the pay rates of serving public servants or compulsory redundancies (save where existing exit provisions apply).  However, we have also made clear that it will only be possible to do so provided there is full delivery of the necessary flexibilities and reforms that are required under the Agreement.  There are no proposals to invoke Paragraph 1.28 of the Agreement (&ldquo;The implementation of this Agreement is subject to no currently unforeseen budgetary deterioration&rdquo;).</P>
        <P>In regard to rostering reform, it is for public service management in the sectors concerned to pursue such reform in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, and the agreements in each sector, in a manner which ensures the full potential of the Croke Park Agreement is realised.  I am not aware of instances where staff are refusing to co-operate with roster reform.  There are some examples of progress in this area including the introduction of an extended working day for medical laboratory staff last year; extended working arrangements for radiography staff from February 2012 and the scheduled introduction of a new roster model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from April 2012.</P>
        <P>Finally, in regard to engagement with the social partners, I addressed a meeting of the IBEC National Council on 25th January last and it was a useful opportunity to listen to the views of IBEC members on a range of issues relating to the public service reform agenda and the Croke Park Agreement.  In addition, my officials are in regular contact with representatives from the Public Services Committee of ICTU, IBEC and other stakeholders on issues relating to the Department&rsquo;s work.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Bord G&aacute;is Eireann&rsquo;s Energy business (but not including BGE&rsquo;s gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors, which will remain in State ownership); and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Consideration will also be given to the sale of some assets of Coillte, but not its land-holdings, and the sale of the States remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price to Government.</P>
        <P>This programme of disposals is based on the guiding principles that there will be no fire sales; integral transmissions and distribution systems will be retained in State ownership and full value will be derived for the State. It represents a commitment by Government to disposals <Col N="200"/>of up to &euro;3bn, and in return the EU/ECB/IMF troika has agreed to the retention of one-third of the proceeds for much needed reinvestment in our economic recovery along the lines suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>

	<P>I announced last week that, following intense engagement, I secured an agreement with the Troika that a third of the proceeds of our asset disposals programme can be used for re-investment in our economy.  This is a substantial change to the Troika&rsquo;s previous position and will help promote recovery in the economy. The Government has agreed with the Troika the sale of state assets up to a value of &euro;3 billion which would mean that we could retain around &euro;1 billion. We are now considering carefully how we should use this money to maximise the return to the economy.</P>

        <Quest> the reason two separate Civil Service mileage rates exist for each engine size, one rate for the first 6,437 km and then a second rate that is almost half that first rate for each class for each kilometre over 6,437 km; the reason these specific kilometre point scales were chosen; the savings that would accrue on 2011 expenditure of the rate was either standardised to the lower rate, or standardised to an equivalent of the mean of the two rates; the number of total kilometres accrued in the Civil Service in 2011 above the 6,437 km rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Motor travel rates are designed to recoup civil servants for the cost of using their cars on official business.  </P>
        <P>The expenses that are covered by the motor travel formula can be broken into two categories; the overhead and the running costs. The overhead costs include the cost of replacing the car, insurance costs, AA/RAC membership, driving licence and car tax.  The running costs include the cost of maintenance, tyres, oil and petrol.</P>
        <P>Overhead costs are incurred whether the car is used on official business or not. The overhead costs are front loaded in the 0 to 6437 kilometre category. In effect 48% of the overhead costs are recouped in the first 6,437 kilometre category while the other 52% are recouped in the next 21,000 kilometres.</P>
        <P>The purpose of front loading the overhead costs is to ensure that more of those costs are recouped to officers in recognition of the fact that they are using their own cars on official business and that some officials may be undertaking small amounts of travel.</P>
        <P>If the rates were not front loaded in this manner, the motor rates for the highest category of car would be constant at about 33.54 cent per kilometre (rather than 59.07 cent for the first 4,000 miles and 25.53 cent thereafter).</P><Col N="201"/>
        <P>It needs to be borne in mind that all travel and subsistence rates were reduced by 25% from March 2009 and have not been amended since then. It was estimated that at the time of the 25% cut the savings that would accrue to the Exchequer would be of the order of &euro;45 million.</P>

	<P>The current civil service Class A and Class B subsistence rates are payment allowances that have been developed through the industrial relations process conducted under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. Historically, there were five classes of subsistence rates in the civil service which ranged from class A to class E. </P>
        <P>Since 2004 a process has been under way  to merge the Class A rate with the lower Class B rate. The mechanism which was being used to achieve this merger was to only apply 40% of any increase to the A rate on each occasion the rates were increased.</P>
        <P>As no increase has been conceded in subsistence rates since 2009 the merger process had not been completed yet, although the difference is marginal. The current rates are set out in the table below:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 to 306, inclusive, and 308 to 311, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure exercise was carried out by all Departments in 2011 to identify means of reducing expenditure, in line with our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery. All proposals, including those from members of the public and third party submissions were fully appraised for this exercise and the outcomes were published in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 </i>  (CER).</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>The Departmental ceilings required to meet this year&rsquo;s expenditure adjustment are clearly set out in the <i>Revised Estimates Volume 2012</i>   (REV), published 23 February 2012, and are consistent with those published in the CER. Furthermore, I have extended the performance budgeting initiative to the majority of Departments, which strengthens the focus on what the public service delivers and aids the process of policy-making through transparency of goals and objectives.  My Department has also recently launched a new, more rigorous Value-for-Money Code which will involve the ongoing process of review and evaluation of programmes across all Departments.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that this Government has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to meet its targets under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support and is confident that by meeting these targets we will continue to improve competitiveness and grow our economy, while continuing to provide high-quality public services with improved efficiency and performance across all areas of public administration. </P>

	<P>I have made it clear to the House on more than one occasion that the Government&rsquo;s programme of asset disposals is based on the guiding principles that there will be no fire sales; integral transmissions and distribution systems will be retained in State ownership and full value will be derived for the State.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU/ECB/IMF Troika has agreed to the retention of one-third of the proceeds for reinvestment in the economy in return for a commitment on our part to a disposal programme of up to &euro;3bn.  Therefore, in addition to its contribution to relieving the State&rsquo;s heavy debt burden, the programme that I announced last week has the potential for significant positive economic outcomes in terms of driving competition in the energy sector and facilitating much needed investment in our recovery.</P>

In accordance with the provisions of the Government Decision, the mileage allowance is reimbursed &ldquo;on the basis of a statement furnished from time to time by the office-holder certifying the total mileage travelled and related to the office, in the car provided by the office holder in place of a State car, in the period covered by the claim.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed Statutory Instrument is intended to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.</P>
        <P>The wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument only allows a right holder to apply for an injunction in respect of a particular work.  It is important to note that the requirement being legislated for is to ensure that right holders are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.  It should be noted that the EU Copyright Directive only directs that an injunction may be applied for &mdash; it does not mandate that it should be granted.  It is also important to note that the granting of injunctions is not an automatic procedure. Injunctions involve a judicial process before the High Court.</P>
        <P>Copyright must be balanced in that process by a consideration of the other rights involved, e.g. protection of private data, freedom of expression and information, the right to conduct a business.  Any remedy must be proportionate.  This is also spelt out in the draft Statutory Instrument when it is explicitly laid down that the rights of any person (including businesses) likely to be affected, must be given due regard when the court is deliberating on the granting of an injunction.</P>
        <P>In other words, before granting any such injunction, a court will have to take into account the fact that blocking access to a website could involve damage to the owners of the legal content on that website.  The court must ensure any remedy is not contrary to the right of information or freedom of expression and that any measures proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly.</P>
        <P>Any injunction under the proposed amendment of the Copyright Act 2000 would have to be considered in the context of the pronouncements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in judgments connected with this area.</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>These judgments (particularly Sabam v Scarlet and Sabam v Netlog) held that the protection of the fundamental right to intellectual property must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental rights of others who would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  These rights include the right to conduct a business, to privacy, to freedom to receive and impart information and reiterated that any remedy proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the targets set out in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy document &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020&rdquo;</i>   is the creation of  62,000 direct jobs in 640 investment projects in the period to 2014, which will result  in 105,000 new jobs overall in the economy, with 50% of investments being located in areas outside of Dublin and Cork. The Strategy also highlights that IDA Ireland will work with existing client companies <Col N="210"/>operating in Ireland to transform the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) base in order to develop, retain and grow employment in these companies.</P>
        <P>Offaly, together with Laois, Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon forms IDA&rsquo;s Midland Region.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the location of emphasis for IDA in the Midlands Region is the linked Gateway of Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar, which IDA actively promotes to potential investors through their network of overseas offices.</P>
        <P>In County Offaly there are 10 IDA supported companies employing approximately 800 people, while in the region as a whole there are 44 IDA client companies employing 4,600 people.</P>
        <P>As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, essential physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional support services. There is intense and continual international competition to win FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million i.e. London, Manchester, Boston and Los Angeles.  Ireland has only one Metro City Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland focuses on marketing Gateway locations within each Region and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In addition, IDA Ireland promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has also invested significantly in the development of property solutions in the Midlands Region that can meet the requirements of new and existing FDI clients.  IDA Ireland will continue to market the available lands and buildings in the Midlands Gateway.  In respect of Co. Offaly, IDA has a fully serviced Business Park in Srah, Tullamore with a number of green field sites available for projects.</P>
        <P>Even with intense global competition for FDI and the very difficult global economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets. IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland, and for the Midlands Region, in order to further the economic development of the Region. It must be remembered, however, that in the final analysis, it is the investor who decides where to locate.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the recently launched the Action Plan for Jobs, I propose to establish a new &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; small and micro-enterprise support structure. These &ldquo;One Stop Shops&rdquo; will be called &ldquo;Local Enterprise Offices&rdquo; and will build on the significant work done by the CEBs to date. The new structure will be achieved through the dissolution of the existing CEBs and the creation of a new Micro Enterprise and Small Business Unit within Enterprise Ireland that will work with the Local Authorities to establish a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in each Local Authority.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the dissolution of the CEB legal structure, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities will be tasked with the practicalities of setting-up and rolling-out a LEO structure. In this regard there is clearly a lot of detailed developmental work to be done over the coming months to effect these changes, and to put appropriate new structures in place. In advance of this work being done it is not possible to say with absolute certainty the exact date of official establishment of the LEO network, however the maintenance of the delivery of supports and services to the micro-enterprise sector is of paramount importance to all concerned and I would underline that it is &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for the clients of the City and County Enterprise Boards until these changes have been effected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 requires Government Departments to report each year on details of their accounting practices.   The Government is nevertheless very much aware of the cash flow difficulties currently being experienced by SMEs. </P>
        <P>In this regard, since 2009, Central Government Departments have been improving their respective payment times and are obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This 15 day prompt payment rule was introduced by the Government on an administrative basis.</P>
        <P>Departments are required to report Quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target. To date, 9 sets of Quarterly returns have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.djei.ie</i> and full details of adherence to the prompt payment rules are avail<Col N="212"/>able online.  The most recent returns, for the last quarter of 2011 will be published on the website shortly.  This data shows that inter alia in value terms of 97.8% of invoices were paid within 15 days.</P>
        <P>The 15 day prompt payment rule was extended beyond central Government Departments and rolled out to the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (excluding Commercial Semi-State bodies), in respect of valid invoices received, on or after, 1 July 2011.</P>
        <P>As part of this new extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish on their respective websites Quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis. The individual bodies covered by this arrangement are also required to publish their own Quarterly reports on their respective websites.</P>
        <P>These new reporting arrangements should ensure that all Ministers will be able to monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and will enable them to address any issues with those bodies who are not meeting these obligations.</P>

	<P>The issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002). </P>
        <P>Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (&ldquo;late payment interest&rdquo;) on the amount outstanding. In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties (i.e. specified in the contract), late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed, provided the invoice is not subject to query. Interest applies until such time as payment is made by the purchaser. The current late payment interest rate from 1 January 2012 is 8% (that is based on the ECB rate of 1% plus the margin of 7%). The Regulations also provide for compensation for debt recovery costs.</P>
        <P>The above Regulations repealed Sections 4 to 11 of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 (No. 31 of 1997). Sections 1 to 3 and 12 to 16 of the 1997 Act remain in force.</P>
        <P>A Ministerial Order made in 2000, under Section 3 of the 1997 Act, entitled the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act 1997 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 2000 (S.I. No. 383 of 2000), the Schedule to the Order, includes under the definition of &ldquo;purchasers&rdquo;:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Accordingly, the National Asset Management Agency, which was established by the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, and which publishes an Annual Report to the Minister for Finance is already covered by the provisions of the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).</P>

	<P>Recruitment to my Department is undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) through competitions advertised in the public press. Therefore, no cost has been incurred by my Department in respect of advertisements placed in national newspapers for job vacancies in the civil service in the past 12 months.   </P>
        <P>There were four new entrants recruited from competitions advertised and undertaken by PAS on behalf of my Department in the last 12 months.  These recruits were appointed to the Competition Authority.   Six vacancies within my Department were filled from inside the Civil and Public Service; three of these by way of promotion, two staff members were taken from the Central Applications Facility and one staff member redeployed from Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
        <P>Information in respect of bodies and agencies under the aegis of my Department is a day to day matter for those organisations and my Department does not have the information sought by the Deputy.  I have, however, requested the relevant Agencies and bodies under the aegis of my Department to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</P>

	<P>The proposed Statutory Instrument is intended to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its obligations under EU law.</P>
        <P>Several concerns were expressed after the judgment by interested parties.  Accordingly a public consultation was held on the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument.  This consultation was widely publicised at the time and more than 50 submissions were received.  I am extremely grateful to those interested parties, groups and individuals who responded.  Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the <Col N="214"/>differing views on the many issues involved.  There was also liaison with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The submissions were carefully considered and legal opinion contained therein was referred to the Office of the Attorney General.  I also met with several organisations with specific interests. The matter was debated in the D&aacute;il on 31st   January 2012.  I stated then that any injunction under the proposed amendment of the Copyright Act 2000 would have to be considered in the context of the pronouncements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in judgments connected with this area.</P>
        <P>These judgments (particularly Sabam v Scarlet and Sabam v Netlog) held that the protection of the fundamental right to intellectual property must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental rights of others who would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  These rights include the right to conduct a business, to privacy, to freedom to receive and impart information.  In addition, any measures proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly.</P>
        <P>Since the Lisbon Treaty, any legislation upholding EU law is bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</P>

	<P>The European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published earlier this month, shows Ireland retaining its position among those Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. The scoreboard shows that Ireland has strengths in a number of areas including Human Resources, open, excellent and attractive research systems, and economic effects, which include employment in knowledge intensive activities and knowledge intensive service exports. It also identifies a number of areas where Ireland&rsquo;s performance is below the EU average, including R&amp;D expenditure in the Government and Higher Education sector, venture capital investment, innovative SME collaborations and SMEs introducing product or process innovations.  However, within some of the areas of relative weakness Ireland is performing above the EU average. For example, while we are below average in &ldquo;innovative SMEs collaborating with others&rdquo; and &ldquo;public and private scientific co-publications&rdquo; we are above average on &ldquo;SMEs collaborating in-house&rdquo;.   </P>
        <P>Innovation is an integral part of overall economic policy and is central to the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda &mdash; this is best illustrated in the recently published Action Plan for Jobs which contains a myriad of initiatives to support broad based innovation.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of the Action Plan for Jobs is to get the economy back on the right path to sustainable, exporting, innovative and enterprise led growth. It engages every Government Department and over 35 Agencies and Offices and will be monitored on a quarterly basis. A key objective of the Plan is to use research and innovation to build competitive advantage. A number of specific initiatives will deliver on this objective.</P>
        <P>The majority of public research funding will be aligned with priority areas where we are most likely to get economic returns and monitoring systems will be put in place to measure the impact of funding. This initiative was approved by Cabinet last week and the Report of the <Col N="215"/>Research Prioritisation Steering Group, which is informing this prioritisation process, will be published tomorrow.  A key economic goal in this process will be a significantly enhanced focus on collaborative research with enterprise and on commercialisation by growing the number of researchers in enterprise and enhancing the flow of researchers between academia and enterprise.</P>
        <P>Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver world class research in third level institutions linked to Irish enterprises. Industry and academia collaborations have now reached 800 linkages across 500 companies.  The remit of Science Foundation Ireland will be extended to include applied research, in addition to its existing remit covering oriented basic research, thereby enhancing the focus on commercialisation. SFI&rsquo;s funding will include support for Research Centres to enable them to build scale and world class in a sustainable way that fully underpins the development of industry in Ireland and the commercialisation of Irish research.</P>
        <P>IDA will continue their strategy of attracting high quality FDI projects to Ireland and more firmly embed existing FDI companies with a strong emphasis on RDI &mdash; in 2011 IDA approvals for RDI stood at &euro;700million representing an increase of 40% from 2010. The Department of Finance is also implementing, via the Finance Bill 2012, the R&amp;D tax credit improvements announced in the budget which will help all companies and support research and innovation generally.  This year, my Department will provide &euro;140m to Enterprise Ireland (EI) to ensure the continued growth in the capacity in indigenous Irish companies to develop innovative and cutting-edge products, processes and services.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will expand their in-company innovation capability and host a Big Ideas Showcase in 2012 to focus on securing investment and identifying business partners that will bring new technologies to the next stage of commercialisation.  New Technology Centres in Cloud Computing, Learning Technologies and Financial Services will be established and preparatory work will begin on others relevant to the prioritisation exercise mentioned already.  EI will also develop and pilot, in the South East, an innovation Graduates Programme managed in conjunction with the Institutes of Technology and open a call under the Innovation Voucher Scheme specifically focused on design and branding activities for SMEs, with Third Level Institutes as providers.  A second call will be launched under Innovation Fund Ireland to attract significant venture capital players to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the area of Intellectual Property (IP) a new Protocol is being developed to manage IP arising from state funded research and a feasibility study is underway to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in IP.</P>
        <P>Public Procurement is also being used as a lever for innovation.  My Department is working with Enterprise Ireland and others to develop a Procuring Innovation Initiative to increase purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to needs rather than specific products or services.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with the Department of Health and relevant State Agencies to develop a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and enterprise leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies.  There are also a number of initiatives being taken to support innovation in sectors including the Green Economy, Agri-Food, ICT, Cloud Computing, Retail and Wholesale.</P>
        <P>Innovation is cross-cutting and requires a broad based approach. The breadth of initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs to support innovation is a testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering innovation policy to support our economic recovery.</P>

	<P>Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) has been administered by my Department since April 2009, when responsibility for the scheme transferred from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either the recommendation of the medical assessor (MA) when the claim was initially processed, or on the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which could potentially affect the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</P>
        <P>Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the MA, are based on the prognosis of the child&rsquo;s disability and how their condition may improve over time. A review date is entered when the claim is initially awarded, as recommended by the MA.</P>
        <P>The review interval will vary from 12 months in cases where the child&rsquo;s disability is likely to improve significantly in the short-term, to a 5 or 10 years review date if the child&rsquo;s condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a &ldquo;do not review again&rdquo; status may be recommended and such cases are not included in the review programme.</P>

	<P>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible and subsequent appeals are submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) without delay.   Invalidity pension is a weekly payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of an illness or incapacity.  To qualify, both medical and social insurance (PRSI) conditions must be satisfied.</P>
        <P>There has been a consistent upward trend in recent years in the number of applicants for invalidity pension.   There were 7,475 new claims registered in 2009, 8,774 in 2010 and 14,621 in 2011.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the challenge of increased volumes of new claims for its schemes, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the deployment of new computer systems.  Processing of new invalidity pension claims on the new system commenced in December 2010 and the existing claimload was transferred to the new system in May 2011.  Significant redeployment of staff resources to project work during the period and some initial technical issues with the new system resulted in unacceptable delays in relation to submission of claims to the SWAO.  The technical issues have since been resolved and delays being experienced have been reduced over the past few months.   Processes and procedures are continuously reviewed with the explicit objective of reducing delays.<b>  </b>  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</P>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible and subsequent appeals are submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) without delay.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>There has been a high volume of applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance in recent years. There were 16,574 registered in 2009, 18,212 in 2010 and 17,259 in 2011.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the challenge of increased volumes of new claims for its schemes, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the deployment of new computer systems. The first tranche of new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims began to be processed under the new system is August 2011. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department. This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times and ancillary work.</P>
        <P>The time taken in 2011 to process a carer&rsquo;s allowance appeal, from the date a notice of appeal is lodged to the date a submission is lodged with the SWAO, is an average of approximately 13 weeks.   Processes and procedures are continuously reviewed with the explicit objective of reducing delays. The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</P>
        <P>Regarding carer&rsquo;s benefit appeals, 80% of appeals submissions are sent to SWAO within four weeks of receipt and the balance within 8 weeks.  This has been consistent for the last three years.</P>

	<P>Following a review of the continuing entitlement of the person concerned to half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of two care recipients, payment of carer&rsquo;s allowance was stopped.  Based upon all the available evidence, including a report submitted by an investigative officer of the Department, it was decided that the person is no longer providing full-time care and attention as laid down in the scheme guidelines. </P>
        <P>On 4 January 2012, she was notified of this decision and the reasons for it. Further information was subsequently submitted by the person concerned requesting a review of the decision.  The deciding officer decided that there was nothing in this information that warranted a revision of the original decision to disallow payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance and the decision stands.   On 14 February 2012, she was notified of the outcome of the review.</P>

        <P>This department received a claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned on 21 June 2011.  The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of her claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria. The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 15 July 2011.</P>
        <P>Further medical evidence was subsequently submitted by the claimant.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who also was of the opinion that she did not satisfy the medical criteria for invalidity pension.  The deciding officer found that there were no grounds to overturn the original decision to disallow invalidity pension and the person concerned was notified of the outcome on 25 January 2012.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has appealed the decision and her file has been forwarded to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P><Col N="233"/>
        <P>As such any clause requiring a minimum education requirement for potential applicants would be counterproductive both to the spirit of the scheme and our ultimate goal of stimulating and encouraging the Labour Market.</P>
        <P>The Internship Scheme is progressing extremely well. Over 4,900 internship placements have commenced since 1 July 2011.  In addition, there are over 2,000 posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.</P>

	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These ENP payments are a vital component of the SWA scheme and link the income support function of the scheme with the wider welfare role of the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</P>
        <P>The Department does not maintain records of the number of applications received or refused for support for religious ceremonies. Records are only available for the number of payments that have been made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 and 394 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to providing a high quality service to our customers.  In most cases, we offer a range of payment options to customers including payment at a local post office via electronic information transfer (EIT), payment through a bank, building society account or certain credit unions via electronic funds transfer (EFT) or payment by cheque.</P>
        <P>There are some exceptions whereby for administrative or control purposes we may limit the choice of payment method. This is determined by reference to the scheme payment which the customer is in receipt of, the payment options available under that scheme and by reference to control and risk consideration. For example, Illness Benefit is not generally paid at Post Offices while on the other hand, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance are generally paid only at Post Offices. In the case of Illness Benefit, payment is generated by a medical certificate, which may be received on any day of the week. Not having a designated payday makes EFT <Col N="234"/>the preferred payment option.  In the case of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, payment at the Post Office contributes to the Department&rsquo;s current approach to fraud control.</P>
        <P>Payment can be received at Post Offices under most of the Department&rsquo;s schemes, including all of the schemes with large numbers of recipients. These are listed in the first of the following tables, while the payments that are not available at post Offices are listed in the second table.</P>

        <Quest> if she would consider, with her EU colleagues, the design and adoption of a system whereby member states could share information on payments and claims being made by citizens in an effort to detect persons who are claiming welfare payments in more than one member state or persons who <Col N="236"/>are employed in one member state while claiming in another, in an effort to tackle social welfare fraud on an EU basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The social security rights of people moving around the EU are governed by EU Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009.  These Regulations, which have been in existence in one form or another since 1959, are designed to co-ordinate the social security systems of the various Member States so that people and their families are not disadvantaged when they move within the EU.</P>
        <P>There is a general duty on Member States to co-operate with one another to ensure the effective implementation of the Regulations.  This entails Member States exchanging information on an on-going basis in relation to insurance records and benefits in payment so that the entitlements of migrant workers under EU regulations can be assessed.  To date, this has been largely paper-based but the EU is, in cooperation with the Member States, currently developing a computerised system to support these information exchanges.</P>
        <P>The target date for having the system fully operational in all Member States is May 2014.  It is expected that the system will streamline the exchange of information thereby ensuring a more speedy payment of benefits to those in cross-border situations.  The EU is also concerned with minimising the incidence of fraud and error associated with the claiming and payment of benefits across the Union and will consider the role the new electronic system can play in supporting action in this area.</P>
        <P>Currently, there is provision in the legislation of my Department to allow an Social Welfare Inspector to investigate a claim at the request of the competent authority of another Member State or other country with which a reciprocal agreement has been made.  Provision is also made for the transfer of bulk information relating to recipients of social welfare payments to the competent authority of another Member State or other country with which a reciprocal agreement has been made.</P>

	<P>My Department accepts reports of possible fraud from members of the public in relation to the operation of its schemes and uses both a dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website for this purpose. Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail as possible about the case they are reporting and they can do so anonymously. </P>
        <P>In 2011, my Department dealt with 16,917 anonymous reports and in approximately 13,000 of these cases, a report of suspected fraud was sent to the relevant area for examination.  In roughly 4,000 of the cases received in 2011, it was not possible to issue a report to an investigator due to (i) a lack of information supplied, (ii) a claim not being in payment or (iii) the information reported would not impact on entitlement.</P>
        <P>Detailed statistics on the outcomes of anonymous reports are unavailable because anonymous or confidential reports of abuse are used merely to trigger or instigate investigations and are not taken into account when the review of the customer&rsquo;s payment is being decided.  In this context the introduction of a reward scheme for information received is not being considered at present.  In addition, my Department is very conscious of its obligations regarding data protection and the privacy of its customers and of persons who report allegations of abuse.</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P>As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</P>

	<P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  My Department has a wide ranging programme to combat social welfare fraud and abuse.  The Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 sets out a range of actions to ensure an integrated approach is taken to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department&rsquo;s various schemes and services. </P>
        <P>In this context, my Department is considering all viable measures that will enhance fraud prevention and detection. The provision of information directly from airlines is one such measure but would necessarily have to be considered in legislative context and in conjunction with those Departments and agencies with primary responsibility for air transport and immigration.  The data protection implications of such a measure would also need to be fully considered.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to work closely with other Departments and agencies in the context of any legislative proposals necessary in this area to ensure that any measures are appropriate and proportionate.</P>

When received, the appeal in question will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer for consideration.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 26 July 2011. The medical evidence supplied with her claim was referred to one of the department&rsquo;s medical assessors who was of the opinion, based on the information supplied, that she was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer <Col N="238"/>accepted this opinion. The deciding officer further decided that the person in question does not meet the condition of being habitually resident in the State, in accordance with the guidelines.  Accordingly, her claim for disability allowance has been refused and the person in question has been notified of the decision and the reasons for it.</P>
        <P>The person concerned failed to meet the condition of being habitually resident in the state on the basis that the nature and purpose of her residence in the State at the time of her application for disability allowance did not provide for habitual residence condition approval. In addition, her main centre of interest was not established in Ireland at the time of her application for disability allowance and she was absent from the State for a lengthy period of time in 2009.</P>

	<P>The community employment (CE) scheme enables lone parents to return to the workforce by offering them part-time and temporary placements in work positions based within local communities.Prior to Budget 2012, lone parents who entered CE were entitled to retain their one-parent family payment (OFP).  From 16 January, 2012, new participants on CE will not be able to claim a social welfare payment at the same time.  As such, from that date onwards, when a lone parent enters CE, their OFP claim will be closed.  This will not affect those who are currently in receipt of the OFP and on CE.  Upon completion of a CE scheme, lone parents are encouraged to seek permanent part-time and full-time work elsewhere based on the experience and new skills that they have gained from CE.  However, if their circumstances remain unchanged and work is unavailable, they can apply for the OFP and, if so, their claim will be treated as a new one.</P>

        <P>The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme provides an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities in the open labour market while continuing to receive an income support payment.</P>
        <P>From 16 January 2012, new participants on Community Employment schemes will not be able to simultaneously claim their original social welfare payment and a Community Employment allowance.  These arrangements apply also to claimants of the Partial Capacity Benefit. Accordingly, it will not be open to claimants to retain Partial Capacity Benefit while on a Community Employment scheme.</P>

        <Quest> if tracking is carried out on social welfare appeals and reviews which are upheld to see whether there is a pattern; if certain deciding officers are negligent or uninformed of qualifying criteria, or if the public are failing at an early stage to submit all documents and information required. </Quest>

	<P>Over 70 different schemes and services are administered by the Department&rsquo;s staff and over two million people receive a weekly payment. In addition, the Department has been faced with an unprecedented increase in the number of people accessing its services over the last couple of years.</P>
        <P>Regarding appeals and reviews, each claim presented is examined on its own merits in relation to the pertinent facts and circumstances. Should any trend in relation to issues with decisions become apparent, however, these are examined to see whether any clarification is needed in relation to the qualifying requirements. There is regular contact between the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the Decisions Advisory Office of the Department in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Staff Development Unit, the central training unit of the Department, has developed a new Deciding Officer course for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit which is currently being delivered to our regional local office trainer network. This structured training initiative is part of the ongoing supports for deciding officers and, in conjunction with on the job training, ensures that deciding officers have the necessary knowledge to deal with the varied and complex decisions that are presented to them, and that decisions made are consistent and of a high standard. Where a question arises as to how to proceed with a decision, the officer can consult the relevant scheme guideline, or following on from this, advice may be sought from the Scheme owners, the Regional Decision Advisor or the Decisions Advisory Office.</P>
        <P>Application forms and explanatory leaflets are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and at the Department&rsquo;s offices and clearly set out the information required. Citizen Information centres can assist customers in completing application forms should they request this. Customers should provide all supporting documentation at the time of claim. However, should they not provide the documentation at that stage, they may provide it at a later stage and it will then be considered by the deciding officer.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its clients and to ensuring continuous improvements in the standard of service it provides. In this regard, the Department receives regular feedback on services through its daily contact with clients.  The Department also has a client consultation framework in place whereby it seeks participation from clients to assist in developing policies and service delivery mechanisms.  This is achieved through surveys, client panels, as well as meetings with client representative groups and those engaged in welfare information services.</P>
        <P>In launching the recent report &ldquo;Person or Number?&rdquo; I referred to the duty of the Department to provide a professional, inclusive and timely service. Such reports, using case studies to highlight the difficulties faced by particular clients, provide a clear indication of where customer service may not meet the standards expected and will be of use in developing our Client Action Plan and Charter for 2012-2014.</P>

	<P>The increase in the Live Register over the past number of years has placed additional pressures on my Department&rsquo;s local offices in terms of providing a satisfactory service to the public. </P>
        <P>As a consequence of this and of the transfer of functions and staff from the HSE and from F&Aacute;S to the Department, some of the Department&rsquo;s buildings require refurbishment, extensions or, in some cases, replacement. The Department relies on the Office of Public Works (OPW) for the provision of new office accommodation. To this end it has requested the OPW as a matter of priority to acquire new local office accommodation in a number of locations throughout the country to enable it deliver a satisfactory service to the public. Priority locations include Loughrea, Balbriggan, Swords, Castlebar and Newbridge.</P>

        <P>Figures for the last quarter of 2011 are unavailable as, due to the introduction of a new claims processing system in the carer&rsquo;s allowance area, new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.  A total of 17,758 carer&rsquo;s allowance applications were registered in 2011 and 13,762 were processed in the same period.  Some 7,698 applications are registered and awaiting a decision at present.</P>
        <P>As mentioned above, a major service delivery modernisation project is under way to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. The first tranche of new care&rsquo;s allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer&rsquo;s allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing systems. In addition, to dealing with approximately 330 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications that are received each week, overtime working is being applied to help reduce backlogs that have built up. However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
        <P>While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted the intake of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims remains at a high level and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making <Col N="242"/>the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
        <P>The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.  In the meantime, if a person&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, they may apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.</P>

        <Quest> if she will indicate the progress of the Civil Registration Act of 2004 so as to allow families of Irish persons who die abroad register for an Irish death certificate. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Usually where an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable.  This certificate, translated if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State.  The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration act, 2004.</P>
        <P>Section 38 of the Act provides that in specific circumstances the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State may be registered here.  This applies where such a death occurs in a place where there is no system of registration or where it is not possible to obtain a copy of or extract from the civil records of the death.  In all other circumstances the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred.</P>
        <P>Any broadening of the current provisions requires careful consideration given the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship.  However, I would hope to be in a position to introduce legislation on this, and other aspects of civil registration, in 2012.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.</P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 and 2011 when the intake rose to 32,432 and 31,241 respectively.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 426 together.</P>
        <P>As an exception to the current moratorium on recruitment across the civil and public service, the Department has received limited sanction to recruit temporary clerical officers to provide cover for  staff  who are absent on a temporary basis due to, for example, sick leave or maternity leave.  When filling a vacancy the Department is obliged, in the first instance, to fill the post by the redeployment of staff from other departments or agencies.  Where there are no staff available from the redeployment panel, the Department then seeks to fill the post by reference to the relevant transfer list.  In accordance with protocols agreed centrally with unions and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the names of officers seeking to transfer to alternative locations are recorded on the relevant transfer list in strict order of date of application. The Department has no discretion to deviate from the order of the lists.</P>

	<P>A Cabinet decision was made in March 2011 confining the use of State cars with effect from the 01 May 2011 and accordingly I now use my own car for official business.  The travel/mileage allowance rates payable depend on the car engine size and also incorporate a number of expense elements associated with the cost of running a car. These cost elements include insurance, full membership of AA/RAC, road tax and licence. The engine size of my car is 1400cc and the rate applicable is 46.25 cent per <Col N="247"/>kilometre.   The costs which I have claimed since the 01 May 2011 to 31 Dec 2011 amount to &euro; 5,825.92.</P>

Total cost of travel and subsistence claimed by my drivers to 31 Dec 2011 is &euro;733.25.  The total cost incurred in all of the above amounts to &euro;41,483.87.</P>

	<P>Hare coursing in the State is administered by the Irish Coursing Club, a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  Statutory responsibility for the Act is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My responsibilities under the Wildlife Acts relate to the conservation of populations of certain protected species, including hares. Where a licence to capture and tag hares under the Wildlife Acts is required, each licence application is dealt with individually, having regard to the conservation impact on the species. My Department has granted such licences to the Irish Coursing Club, on behalf of their affiliated clubs, in relation to the holding of coursing meetings during the 2011/2012 season.</P>

However, I have stated that one of my biggest challenges is to work towards greater common understanding of the issues we face in protecting our natural heritage. My Department has significant challenges before it to ensure that Ireland is in full compliance with EU Directives on nature conservation and that we ensure that the richness of Ireland&rsquo;s built and natural heritage contributes to national economic recovery. It is my view that the resources of my Department should be focused on those areas at this time.</P>

	<P>Article 9 of the Habitats Directive provides for de-designation of Special Areas of Conservation. According to the Directive, this is only permissible where it is warranted by natural developments noted as <Col N="248"/>a result of the surveillance undertaken by the Member State. Natural developments are understood to mean situations where habitats may be damaged by erosion, landslides or other occurrences in nature. Any de-designation would require the agreement of the European Commission and be undertaken on the basis of clear scientific evidence.  On foot of discussions with Commission officials, my Department&rsquo;s clear understanding is that the provisions of Article 9 do not apply to the situation in regard to turf-cutting on raised bog SACs in Ireland where damage has been caused by manmade drainage and extraction.</P>

	<P>The Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2010 prohibit the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation growing on uncultivated land or in hedges or ditches during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife, from 1 March to 31 August.  This is subject to certain specific exceptions, one of which permits these activities during the prohibited period on grounds of public health and safety, notably where road hazards may require hedge trimming or vegetation clearance.</P>
        <P>Hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats and they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity. Accordingly, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review the overall policy in this area.

	<P>A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated the population of wild mink in the State could reach a total of between 20,500 and 33,500 individuals, and identified ground-nesting birds as the species most vulnerable to mink predation.   Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species, including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns, from a range of predators, including mink.   Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these bird species.</P>
        <P>With regard to the particular funding referred to by the Deputy, I requested, in granting the funding in question to the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC), that, as far as it is possible, special attention should be given to the counties of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry to enhance work in those areas where my Department has been concentrating its own efforts. My Department is particularly aware of the potential impacts of mink control on non-target species, especially otter, pine marten and stoat. The funding, therefore, is being provided to the NARGC with a strong reminder that these other species are protected. Accordingly, even accidental capture of such species while targeting mink would be an offence and only acceptable legal forms of live traps can be used, with snares and fentraps expressly forbidden.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The land referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question is situated in one of 24 raised bog special areas of conservation (SACs) affected, from the end of last year, by the cessation of turf cutting for reasons of environmental protection under the EU Habitats Directive.  In April 2011, the Government announced a redress package for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in such cases. The package offers qualifying turf cutters the option of a financial payment of &euro;1,000 per year, index linked, over 15 years or, where feasible, relocation to non-designated bogs, where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The cost of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.</P>
        <P>In December 2011, my Department wrote to known owners of land and rights in the 24 SACs to inform them of the cessation of turf cutting in these sites and to invite applications for compensation. Advertisements have also been placed in local and national papers. The deadline for the receipt of applications for compensation is the end of February 2012.</P>

	<P>Commercial peat extraction operations have been prohibited from Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas since 1999. In areas outside such sites, peat extraction is governed through the planning system and requirements for Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licensing.  Under the provisions of a derogation given in 1999 by the then Minister, turf-cutting by individuals for their own domestic supply was allowed to continue on raised bog SACs for a period of ten years. This period has now elapsed. No further turf-cutting can occur on these bogs without express legal consent. I have put in place a scheme to provide compensation to affected turf-cutters or to facilitate their relocation to alternative non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.</P>

	<P>Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed on behalf of my Department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community <Col N="254"/>Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</P>
        <P>The SEAI are in the process of contract renewal with the network of Community Based Organisations (CBOs) with a view to concluding negotiations at the earliest possible opportunity.  In addition, an Invitation to Tender was recently published by the SEAI to establish a new panel of private contractors to augment this network.  The public procurement process through the Official Journal of the European Union will take a number of weeks to conclude and a panel should be in place by early in Quarter Two.</P>
        <P>The SEAI advises that there are a total of 10,382 homes on the national waiting list as of 13 February 2012.  Service delivery plans, within the available 2012 budget, are currently being finalised.  Households on the waiting list on 31 December 2011 will be retrofitted according to their position on the waiting list.</P>
        <P>2012 will mark a shift in emphasis on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy, which I launched last November.  Heretofore, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.  The focus in 2012 will shift to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority; such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and thus the delivery of broadband services is a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators which are licensed and regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are <Col N="255"/>available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  The general area of Greetiagh, Bohermeen, County Meath encompasses two EDs; namely Ardbraccan ED (Ref: 167002) and Martry ED (Ref: 167060).  Ardbraccan ED is in the NBS Coverage Area and Martry ED falls outside of the NBS Coverage Area.</P>
        <P>The EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where existing service providers operate.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS in 2008, found that broadband services were available in Martry ED and consequently the ED was excluded from the Scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Should residents in the general area of Greetiagh Bohermeen, County Meath, wish to check if their premises is in in the NBS Coverage Area, they can do so by contacting 3 by telephone at 1800 944791 or by using the Coverage Check facility on 3&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i> http://www.three.ie/contractstore/shop/flow/BroadbandCoverageCheck.aspx</i></P>
        <P>The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  I intend to consider the findings and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce as quickly as possible and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</P>

	<P>Specific statistics on broadband uptake by SMEs are not currently gathered.  It is known however, that as of mid-2011 for Enterprises in Ireland (with 10 or more employees), 91% had a broadband connection (source: Central Statistics Office Information Society Statistics 2011).  These statistics are based on a survey of e-commerce and ICT usage by enterprises that was conducted by the Central Statistics Office in the first half of 2011.</P>
        <P>There is a mounting body of evidence illustrating the value to enterprises in general, and SMEs in particular, of getting on-line and taking advantage of the enormous commercial potential offered by the Internet, especially in the areas of online marketing and commerce.</P>
        <P>Part of the work currently being undertaken by the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce includes examining ways of boosting Internet usage, particularly among the segments of Irish society that have been identified as being digitally disengaged.  The SME sector is seen as an important focus and I expect that there will be recommendations emanating from the Task Force Report specifically focussing on the need to address this issue.  I note also that there are a number of private sector initiatives currently being rolled out to assist small businesses in availing of the opportunities that the Internet presents.</P>
        <P>I expect that the recommendations of the Task Force and experience of existing initiatives will help to inform policy on the roll out and take-up of broadband services to the benefit of society and economy generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been open to competition since late 1999 and has <Col N="258"/>succeeded in attracting many of the major international players in addition to a high number of indigenous service providers.</P>
        <P>There is no national direct State involvement in the Communications Market.  State involvement tends to arise in the provision of services in cases of clear market failure (for example through the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the current Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid rules, which require the State to demonstrate market failure and to be technology-neutral and company-neutral in procuring services.</P>
        <P>Eircom is a private company and clearly has a major role in the broadband market.  It is therefore not possible for the State to in any way subsidise investment in this (or any other company&rsquo;s) infrastructure without distorting competition and breaching EU competition rules.</P>
        <P>As a consequence of continued private sector investment and the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s NBS and RBS, Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>
        <P>With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened last summer has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  I intend to consider the findings and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce as quickly as possible and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</P>

        <P>In that reply I indicated that discussions with relevant stakeholders, including the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA), the IDA and Enterprise Ireland would be advanced urgently in the context of the announcement on 17 November last.  I also advised the Deputy that the process would also take account of a Strategic Review of the Digital Hub by my Department.</P>
        <P>In the intervening period my officials have met a number of the relevant stakeholders and I have also met with the DHDA CEO and some of his senior management team.</P>
        <P>This process of stakeholder engagement, which includes the DHDA management, is continuing with a view to informing decisions on the long term future of the agency.</P>
        <P>Regarding any concerns that companies operating within the Digital Hub or any prospective companies considering locating there may have, I re-iterate my view that the Digital Hub is <Col N="259"/>playing an important role in promoting employment and new opportunities in the digital media sector.  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Action Plan for Jobs also recognises the role of the Digital Hub in sustaining new jobs and enterprise.  It is my intention that any new governance model that emerges over the coming months will continue to maintain and support the valuable work of the DHDA.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 134 of 18 January 2012.</P>
        <P>The decision on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors is statutorily a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no function in the matter.  The CER, as the independent energy regulator has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  It also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers. I am aware that on the 17th  February the CER published a Proposed Decision Paper on the issue of the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors.  Together with all players and potential players in Ireland&rsquo;s gas market, Shannon LNG has a key commercial interest in the outcome of the CER&rsquo;s ultimate decision on this very complex regulatory question and given the complexities there are many different perspectives on this issue.</P>
        <P>The CER has announced that it intends to hold one further Public Forum for stakeholders on the 1st March.  Given the multiplicity of perspectives on the matter, I expect that all stakeholders will be attending the Forum.</P>
        <P>In tandem, stakeholders have the additional opportunity to respond to the CER by the 16th March on the matters raised in the Proposed Decision Paper.  At the end of this period, the CER will assess all comments received and publish a final decision.  I understand that the CER expects a final decision to be available by the end April.  The CER&rsquo;s decision will bring the regulatory certainty which is needed by all stakeholders in the gas market including those with investment decisions to make.</P>

	<P>The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, the subsidiary Network Company of BGE, which is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory, independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</P><Col N="261"/>
        <P>The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This policy ensures that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</P>
        <P>Having regard to CER&rsquo;s current network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns (including Cavan) not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy.  The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER.  The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Cavan, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis.  I understand that following a recent assessment by the CER of a Gaslink-review of Cavan, the CER found that Cavan failed to meet the specific economic criteria to allow the town to be approved for connection to the national gas network. The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &mdash; 2011, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 set out certain classes of development which are exempt from planning permission requirements.  The exemptions are circumscribed by article 9, which places a number of general qualifications on the availability of exemptions: e.g. where the development would impact on a national monument. </P>
        <P>Article 13 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 amended Class 17 of Schedule 2, Part 3 of the Regulations to provide that peat extraction in a new or extended area of less than 10 hectares is exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.</P>
        <P>However, section 17(<i>b</i>) of the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 amended section 4(4) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 to provide that development is not be exempted development if an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment of the development is required.</P>
        <P>The extraction of peat in the course of business which involves an area exceeding 50 hectares is an integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) activity licensable by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 to 2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to introduce a monthly instalment payment option for motor tax.</P>
        <P>The rates of duty currently applicable to half-year and quarterly discs are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual rate respectively.  These relativities have remained generally constant since the 1960s, although they were reduced to 55% and 27.5% respectively in the period between 1992 and 2001.</P>
        <P>The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-year and quarterly discs is in the region of &euro;20m.  Were changes to be introduced to charge for these discs on a pro-rata basis, the loss in income would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.</P><Col N="263"/>

        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, set out the legislation underpinning the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences respectively.</P>

Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</P>
        <P>The definition of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; in section 2(1) of the Acts is relevant when considering whether a property that is not used or lived in is liable to the charges.</P>
        <P>The Acts contain a common definition of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; as a &ldquo; ... building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling ... &rdquo;.</P><Col N="264"/>
        <P>There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to the charges. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the Acts.</P>
        <P>The Acts place the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the charges on the relevant liability dates and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charges in respect of that property by the due dates.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self assessment basis and interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</P>
        <P>Section 3(4) of the Act provides that where a residential property is owned by two or more persons, those persons shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the household charge in respect of that property.</P>
        <P>There are a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge under the legislation.  In particular, section 4(2) of the Act provides an exemption from liability to pay the household charge for the year in which that liability date falls if, on that date, an individual who is the owner of a residential property, which was that person&rsquo;s main or sole residence, is not residing in that property by reason of his or her having had to vacate the property due to long term mental or physical infirmity and that person is residing in another property that he/she does not own.</P>
        <P>Section 4(6) of the Act defines the meaning of &ldquo;long term mental or physical infirmity&rdquo; as that which required the person to vacate the property in which he/she had been dwelling for a continuous period of more than 12 months and provides that such an infirmity must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.</P>

Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws.</P>

	<P>In March 2011, the Court of Justice of the European Union found against Ireland in Case C-50/09 to the effect that Ireland had:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) not fully transposed Article 3 of <i>Council Directive 85/337/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment</i>, as amended (commonly known as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive);</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) excluded demolition works from the scope of Irish legislation transposing the EIA Directive; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) not fully met its decision-making obligations pursuant to the EIA Directive in relation to projects involving a dual consent, that is, both a land use consent and a pollution control consent.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In respect of (1) above, sections 53 and 54 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 directly transpose Article 3 of the EIA Directive into Irish planning legislation.  Furthermore, acknowledging the wider applicability of Article 3 to other consent systems provided for in Irish law, my Department, in consultation with other Departments, is currently in the process of engaging on these other legislative consent processes outside the planning system to ensure full and correct transposition of Article 3 in those codes.</P>
        <P>In respect of (2) above, developing on the legislative amendments contained in the Planning and Development Regulations 2008, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 provide that the category of &lsquo;works of demolition&rsquo; now requires EIA.  I understand that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is examining the scope for legislative reform as it relates to EIA in the context of its National Monuments legislation.</P>
        <P>In respect of (3) above, my Department is currently considering possible amending legislation which would prohibit an applicant from submitting a stand-alone environmental licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in certain cases unless it is clearly established that mandatory or sub-threshold EIA is not required in respect of the proposed activity.  Conversely, if EIA is necessary, the applicant would be required to submit either a <Col N="267"/>copy of the Environmental Impact Statement which forms parts of the planning application (to be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la) or a screening decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la confirming that EIA is not required for the proposed licensable activity.  Consideration is also being given to the inclusion of formal consultation mechanisms between the EPA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to further underpin the integrated decision-making process between the two agencies.</P>
        <P>In view of the foregoing actions already taken and being expedited, and acknowledging my Department&rsquo;s ongoing consultations with the European Commission on complex legal issues, I am confident that Ireland is addressing the findings of the court in this case in a considered and comprehensive manner, which should ensure full and correct transposition and implementation of the EIA Directive in national legislation, and secure early resolution of the case.</P>

	<P>Since the Rental Accommodation Scheme began in late 2005, some 37,757 households have transferred from rent supplement into RAS or other social housing options. Of these 21,892 were housed directly under RAS.  </P>
        <P>Each local authority is responsible for the effective and efficient management of the scheme within its own area, including the management of vacancies that arise.  Notwithstanding this where a vacancy does arise local authorities have three months to fill that vacancy before my Department discontinues recoupment in respect of that accommodation.</P>
        <P>Housing authorities are very conscious of the need to attain value for money, and particularly so in the current economic climate.  Value for money in relation to RAS can be viewed in a number of ways and can reflect both direct and indirect financial costs and benefits. Negotiating rent reviews and discounts along with the efficient management of RAS properties are some of the means my Department has advised authorities to utilise to attain good value and ensure the appropriate use of public funds.  A value for money and policy review study of RAS is currently under way and will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to a fundamental reorganisation of local government structures with the aim of bringing about stronger, more cohesive, local government with greater capacity to address challenges, maximise efficiency and promote economic and social development.  Wider policy proposals will be brought to Government in the near future for an action programme on local government, with particular attention being given to strengthening local government structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government.  The programme will also reflect work under way in relation to alignment of local and community development with local government and local government efficiency implementation. </P>
        <P>The community and voluntary sector has a vital role to play in partnership with local communities, State agencies and local authorities in developing sustainable communities where local enterprise initiatives can thrive and develop into the future. Initiatives generated in the community often address a variety of issues that influence job creation both directly and indirectly.  Under the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) the Government supports the participation and empowerment of local communities in tackling disadvantage.  This Programme targets 80% of programme budgets towards the provision and coordination of education and employment supports to these communities, with the remainder focusing on access and uptake of services and promoting the engagement of disadvantaged communities with policy and practice.  To this end some &euro;55 million will be invested in our communities through the LCDP in 2012.</P>
        <P>This Government remains committed to the regeneration of the estates and communities in our most disadvantaged areas.  Despite the current adverse economic conditions and consequent Exchequer constraints, I am continuing to prioritise funding for regeneration within the overall social housing programme. Last year alone my Department provided &euro;118 million for regeneration, representing 25% of the total housing capital investment programme.</P>
        <P>As regard planning, transparency has always been an essential part of the planning system.  Insofar as the planning application process is concerned there is a facility for the public/third parties to make submissions, and to appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord <Col N="269"/>Plean&aacute;la.  In relation to development by a local authority the Planning Act and Regulations similarly make provision for input from the public, whether in the case of decisions made by the elected members of the local authority, or, as is the case where the development would require assessment under the Environmental Impact Assessment or Habitats Directives, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The forward planning process also makes provision for statutory consultation with the public in relation to the preparation of development plans and local area plans.</P>
        <P>Also, my Department is advancing a significant programme of reform in the planning area to support proper planning and sustainable development and economic renewal.  The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) is a twenty-year planning framework designed to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions, including the urban structure of Gateway cities and towns, Hub towns and other towns and villages. A comprehensive review of implementation of the NSS was undertaken during 2010, culminating in the publication in October 2010 of the NSS Update and Outlook Report (available at <i>environ.ie</i>);<b> </b>this addresses<b> </b>a range of issues relevant to urban areas, including the vitality of city and town centres.</P>
        <P>In addition, the adoption of updated Regional Planning Guidelines in 2010 for the twelve-year period to 2022, and legislative requirements under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to include new Core Strategies in development plans, are further implementing the NSS within the forward-planning process and ensuring an appropriate policy focus on the importance of urban areas, including city and town centres, for the long term proper planning and sustainable development of the country.</P>
        <P>My Department published statutory <i>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (Cities, Towns and Villages)</i> in December 2008.  The Guidelines are accompanied by an Urban Design manual which sets out practical examples and best practice.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I intend shortly to finalise draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Retail Planning on foot of the submissions received during the public consultation process.  These Guidelines are aimed, inter alia, at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres, and also highlight the options open to planning authorities for the operations of Business Improvement Districts as provided by the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006.  I also intend to publish a consultation draft of planning guidelines on Local Area Plans later this year which will also address matters relating to the vitality of city and town centres.</P>
        <P>I am, in addition, working in conjunction with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on a <i>Manual for Streets</i> which will address design guidance and standards for streetscapes and related shared space, and will be guided by universal design and accessibility principles.</P>
        <P>I am therefore satisfied that this policy and legislative framework, together with the suite of existing and proposed planning guidelines, will ensure effective delivery of a sustainable policy, but I will continue to keep under review the need for any further provisions in this regard.</P>

	<P>There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system <i>www.householdcharge.ie</i>   is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card or in four instalments of &euro;25 by direct debit.  In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card or in four instalments of &euro;25 by direct debit by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments are available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way must register their details before 1 March, 2012.  </P>
        <P>A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county/city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge up to 31 March, 2012.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>Payment of the charge on non-principal private residences may be made by credit/debit card via the online system <i>www.nppr.ie</i>.  In addition, persons can make payment by cheque, postal order and credit/debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to NPPR PO Box 11654, Dublin 8.  Persons may also pay the charge at the office of the local authority in whose area the property concerned is situated.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that there are comprehensive suites of payment options available to persons to pay the charges.</P>

	<P>The <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012</i>, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Galway.  The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some &euro;130 million in Co. Galway during the period of <Col N="277"/>the Programme.  However, the Kilconnell Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.</P>
        <P>The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.  Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.</P>
        <P>Progress under the <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012</i> was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Kilconnell Sewerage Scheme was received from Galway County Council in response to the review.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland is committed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels over the 2008-2012 period. In accordance with the National Climate Change Strategy, that target will be met on foot of domestic mitigation action supplemented by the purchase of carbon allowances or credits under the flexible mechanisms provided for in the Protocol.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas mitigation target for 2020 requires a 20% reduction on 2005 levels in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS).  This reduction must be achieved along a legally-binding trajectory, beginning in 2013 at the average emissions for 2008-2010, with annual targets up to 2020. This poses a very significant challenge and, even under the most optimistic scenario, a compliance gap will need to be bridged.  This gap will be addressed through domestic policy development complemented, as necessary, by use of the flexibilities provided in Decision 406/2009/EC of 23 April 2009.</P>
        <P>Irish installations participating in the EU-ETS will operate within an EU-wide cap which will deliver a 21% reduction on 2005 levels by 2020.</P>
        <P>The review of national climate policy which I published in November 2011 was based on a major stock-taking exercise and is intended to provide the basis for a wide-ranging debate on future policy development.  Building on that foundation, the policy agenda will be progressed in three, interconnected ways.</P>
        <P>Firstly, the Government has decided to ask the Secretariat to the National Economic and Social Council to carry out an independent piece of analysis to inform advancement of the national mitigation agenda in line with our EU commitments and with a view to developing a longer-term plan for a low-carbon future.  This work is expected to be finalised by end-2012.  Secondly, a public consultation will commence shortly to ensure the widest possible range of views and ideas inform future policy.  Finally, there will be continued engagement across Government via the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy with a view to making progress on sectoral mitigation measures.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 to 493, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery. I am prioritising this commitment, as I am anxious to provide early regulatory certainty, in the form of both policy and legislation, to ensure that the necessary actions and investments are progressed to achieve those aims. The new national waste policy will address all tiers of the waste hierarchy, including recycling, recovery and disposal, and will also address other matters, such as the roles of the public and private sectors. I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in relation to national waste policy to Government by Easter this year.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for hazardous waste management planning is assigned to the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Management Act 1996. The National Hazardous Waste Management Plan 2008-2012 sets out priority actions for prevention, collection, self sufficiency and management of hazardous wastes. The Plan is scheduled to be reviewed in 2012.</P>
        <P>As regards the Poolbeg project, in accordance with the provisions of the Waste Management Acts, the preparation and adoption of a waste management plan, including in respect of infrastructure provision, is the statutory responsibility of the local authority or authorities concerned, and under section 60(3) of the Act the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. The Poolbeg project is being advanced by Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities. Questions concerning the status of the project should be directed to the City Council.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water. The Memorandum of Understanding with the EU, the IMF and the ECB also contains commitments for the reform of water services delivery and operation and the introduction of domestic water charges.</P>
        <P>To meet these commitments, the Government intends initiating a universal water metering programme in advance of the introduction of water charges. This will facilitate moving to a charging system for domestic water users that is based on use above a free allowance as provided for in the Programme for Government.  A procurement strategy for the metering programme is currently being finalised. A public consultation on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for reform of water services delivery in Ireland, including metering and water charges, recently concluded and my Department is currently examining the submissions that were received.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government acknowledges that having regard to the pressures on the national finances, the funding of local government and the associated locally delivered services should be put on a sound financial footing, with better alignment between the cost of providing services and the demand for those services.</P>
        <P>It is clear that local authorities require sufficient funding to ensure that they can operate effectively and efficiently across their wide range of functions and responsibilities.  Funding decisions must be balanced against the constraints imposed by the economic climate and the need at local level to balance required service provision with the impact of local rates and charges on business and enterprise.</P>
        <P>The existing revenue base of local authorities is narrow by international standards.  This was a consideration in the introduction of the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences in 2009.  A further broadening of the revenue base for local government is being achieved as a result of the introduction of the household charge from 2012 as required under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government has established an Inter-Departmental expert Group to consider the structure and modalities for an equitable valuation based property tax. This Group will complete its work and make recommendations to me by end April 2012.  I will bring proposals to Government later this year for a more comprehensive and equitable valuation-based property tax to replace the household charge.  The introduction of a full property tax provides the opportunity <Col N="281"/>to deal conclusively with this essential element of local government reform and create a system of local government that is more efficient, responsible, accountable and self-reliant.</P>

	<P>Part 5 of the Electoral (Amendment) Political Funding Bill 2011, published on 15 December 2011, provides that political parties will face a cut of half their State funding received under the Electoral Act 1997 if they do not have at least 30% women and 30% men candidates at the next general election.  Seven years from the general election where this provision first applies, the Bill makes provision for this figure to rise to 40% in respect of each gender, commencing at the general election held next after that.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Payments made to qualified political parties under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997 are linked to performance at a General Election and these new requirements will therefore apply in respect of candidates of political parties at a General Election.  There is no linkage between these payments and local elections.  The measures in Part 5 of the Bill will therefore not apply in respect of the 2014 local elections.  It is, however, my intention that the measures should have a knock-on effect by providing an incentive to political parties voluntarily to apply similar arrangements at local elections.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 and 503 together.  </P>
        <P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.  The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.</P>
        <P>Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.</P>
        <P>I have asked local authorities to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoption of their 2012 budgets.  As of 23 February 2012, 64 of the 88 rating authorities have submitted their adopted Budgets to my Department. Of those, 50 maintained their ARV at 2011 levels, and 14 have reduced their ARV.  I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under consideration in my Department.</P>

	<P>In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.  The financial parameters within which we will have to operate in the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.<b><i></i></b> Nevertheless, the <Col N="284"/>Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.</P>
        <P>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s new housing policy statement, published in June 2011, serves as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term. Within this framework is recognition of the obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</P>
        <P>In that context, in December 2011 NAMA identified over 2,000 properties as being potentially available for social housing.  Local Authorities and the Housing Agency are working systematically with NAMA to determine if there is a demand for properties identified as potentially suitable for social housing. Where a demand is identified, this information is provided to NAMA and efforts made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.  The units being advanced by NAMA will be provided through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply.</P>

	<P>The current homeless strategy, The Way Home &mdash; A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness 2008-2013, sets out Government policy on tackling homelessness and has a number of key aims including: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />preventing homelessness,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />eliminating the need to sleep rough,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />eliminating long-term occupation of emergency accommodation,</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring effective services,</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />better co-ordinated funding arrangements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While the current Strategy is fundamentally sound, some key targets have not been achieved and the Programme for Government is committed to reviewing the current strategy and to adopting a &lsquo;housing led&rsquo; approach to homelessness. Work now underway on updating the strategy is almost complete and the review will take account of demands on existing housing, will assess how to best continue providing services, and will ensure more effective prevention strategies.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply for the homeless, and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches. The initial emphasis will necessarily be on the Dublin region, where homeless numbers are most acute, by moving away from the current over reliance on emergency accommodation provision to a more permanent accommodation solution, to be achieved through a number of measures including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Directly linking the provision of funding with specific targets and outcomes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Making better use of the existing available accommodation units in the local authorities and in the voluntary sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Additional social housing provision through acquisitions and remedial works/upgrading of vacant local authority housing stock and a leasing programme;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Ongoing engagement with NAMA to secure properties;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Targeted use of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />An enhanced role for the private rental sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Better co-ordination with the voluntary and cooperative housing sector; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />The establishment of Homeless Action Teams across all regions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department&rsquo;s funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is &euro;50 million, which together with 10% provided from housing authorities&rsquo; own resources, brings the total available funding to &euro;55.55 million in 2012. This level of funding means that there will be no reduction in the provision of essential front line support services.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Plan for the Homeless Strategy also provides for the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities with emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency, value for money and greater local decision making in homeless services.</P>
        <P>A Protocol which sets outs arrangements and responsibilities for delegation of Section 10, Housing Act, 1988 funding between my Department and Dublin City Council in relation to the provision of ongoing revenue funding for homeless accommodation and related service costs has already being put in place in the Dublin region beginning 1 January 2012.  This will be extended nationally to the other regions beginning quarters April 2012 and July 2012.</P>

	<P>This Government remains fully committed to the regeneration of the estates and communities in our most disadvantaged areas.  Despite the current adverse economic conditions and consequent Exchequer constraints, we continue to prioritise funding for regeneration within the overall social housing programme.  Last year alone my Department provided &euro;118 million for regeneration, representing 25% of the overall housing capital investment programme. </P>
        <P>My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects which seek to address the causes of disadvantage through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration. The national regeneration programme includes a wide variety of projects ranging from large-scale urban regeneration projects such as those in Ballymun and Limerick City, to smaller estate-wide regeneration projects in Dublin city and in a number of regional towns around the country. There is a requirement for regeneration projects to deliver more than just an improvement in the housing standards of an area, by taking a broader approach to addressing the socioeconomic and infrastructural deficits that contribute to the social exclusion of the community. On that basis, the regeneration projects supported by my Department take a broad focus beyond the regeneration of the physical environment, to also deliver social and economic regeneration in these areas.</P>
        <P>This year, the total funding available for the housing capital investment programme will be over &euro;390 million. I envisage making announcements in relation to budgets or allocations for the various housing programmes, including the regeneration programme, in early March.</P>

        <QRef>[11115/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).  The charge is set at &euro;200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.   </P>
        <P>There is no obligation on local authorities to issue notifications or invoices regarding the charge. Nationwide advertising took place in both 2009 and 2010, and again in 2011, to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  Communications have also been issued by local authorities and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.</P>
        <P>The LGMA which is operating the NPPR on-line payment service issued 169,036 communications to NPPR owners from 19-26 April 2011 relating to 323,031 NPPR properties potentially liable for the 2011 charge.</P>
        <P>From 26 April, 2011 to date, the NPPR payment was made in respect of 296,255 properties of which 29,374 also paid a late payment fee.</P>
        <P>26,776 of those who paid in 2010 did not pay again in 2011.  There are a number of valid reasons as to why a person who paid an NPPR charge in 2010 did not pay again in 2011, including where, by reason of transfer or sale, the property concerned is no longer a property that is liable to the charge under the legislation.</P>
        <P>Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self-assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 518 together. </P>
        <P>My Department has not received communication of the nature referred to in the Question from Dublin City Council. It is a matter for individual local authorities to advance relevant development proposals for their areas as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Specific responsibility for the planning and delivery of the North and South Fringe development rests, respectively, with Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  Dublin City Council adopted its Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017 and Fingal County Council adopted its Fingal Development Plan 2011-2017 both of which set out statutory objectives for the development of the North and South Fringe, respectively.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the North Fringe Framework Development Plan, which was prepared by Dublin City Council in 2000, sets out the objectives for the area, the site context and the urban design framework.  I understand that it also continues to inform development management and planning guidance in the North Fringe area. A North Fringe Cross-Authority Forum established in 2004 continues to monitor progress in the implementation of the North Fringe Framework Development.  Meetings continue to be held on a cross-authority basis at which a wide range of issues relating to the planning and delivery of the North Fringe development are discussed and actions taken.</P>
        <P>One of the main benefits of designation of an area as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) is the co-ordinated planning and development of undeveloped sites on the basis of a planning scheme made by the local authority, with a good degree of certainty on the exact type and nature of development that will take place.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the good ongoing cooperation within the statutory framework of the existing development plans I do not believe that an SDZ would be the appropriate vehicle to deliver on areas such as the North and South Fringe.  The adopted development plans are in place to guide considerable development and continue to be the basis against which planning permissions and ancillary development are considered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 and 517 together. </P>
        <P>The formulation of Site Resolution Plans (SRP) is a key tool in resolving issues in unfinished developments. Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial insti<Col N="289"/>tutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership in a way that is in the best interests of residents.</P>
        <P>As part of the work of the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments my Department has initiated a pilot project for the resolution of sites using the site resolution plan process.  As part of the process my Department has issued a working template in order to establish best practice in this area.   I intend that the process which is pivotal to the resolution of problem sites, will be used more extensively in the coming year. Ultimately however, the initiation of the SRP process in respect of a particular development is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

        <P>The Steering Group presented its Interim Report to me in December 2011.  It outlined some preliminary conclusions vis-&agrave;-vis the existing arrangements and the respective roles of local authorities and local and community development.  The Report can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>).</P><Col N="290"/>
        <P>I expect to receive the Steering Group&rsquo;s Final Report shortly, and I will consider the Group&rsquo;s recommendations carefully in determining how best to ensure that we pursue the most effective and efficient service design and delivery model for communities.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the case of people (details supplied) in County Donegal whose application for a council mortgage was rejected on the grounds that neither applicant had been in employment for the required two years; and if he will address this refusal in view of the fact that the family have a proven track record of timely payment of their current rent which is higher than the proposed mortgage repayment. </Quest>

	<P>Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and associated credit policy.  In assessing loan applications, local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment or social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.  In such cases, long-term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long-term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant or refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority.  All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.</P>
        <P>The relevance of the difference between projected mortgage repayments and current rental payments for a prospective purchaser is limited.  It takes no account, for example, of the fact that while rent levels can be adjusted to reflect changing household income, mortgage repayments cannot.  It does not take account of the additional costs taken on when a household becomes a homeowner thereby assuming responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of their home.  While it is the case that the rate of refusal of applications for loan finance has increased, it is also clear that the loans issued since the introduction of the revised credit policy are more likely to be fully performing.  I am happy that the current mortgage loan model is fair and adequately meets the needs of prospective borrowers and facilitates participation in housing acquisition initiatives such as the tenant purchase schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 to 526, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The recruitment moratorium in the Public Service, which was introduced by the Government in March 2009 as an emergency measure in response to the financial crisis facing the State, remains in place.  Under the terms of the moratorium, no public service post, however arising, may be filled.  When vacancies arise, public bodies must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.  My Department has delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium across all local authorities.  This is on the condition that the overall staffing levels in the local government sector are reduced in line with the employment control framework.  Under the terms of the moratorium, all staffing requests must be agreed with my Department, which works closely with local authorities to ensure critical posts are filled while overall numbers are reduced.  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need for further reduction in overall staffing levels and expenditure in the local authority.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements, including recruitment and day to day operational measures, necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure the reduction in staff numbers is managed so the appropriate service level is maintained.  The cost of operational overtime for Dublin Fire Brigade in 2011 was &euro;3.09 million, which equates to 4.93% of payroll.  This is expected to reduce to &euro;1.5 million per annum following the implementation of Croke Park proposals.  I understand that 15 Dublin Fire Brigade operational employees are expected to retire between January and February 2012.  The number employed at the end of February will be 861.  The number of fire fighters employed by Dublin City Council at the end of December 2011 was 876 whole-time equivalent full-time fire fighters and 26 retained fire fighters.  This compares to the June 2008 figure of 825 whole-time equivalent full-time fire fighters and 54 retained fire fighters.  I also understand that the position in relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade is kept under constant review by Dublin City Council management.  The panel which was in place since 2007 expired in December 2011 and no further appointments will be made from this panel.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 529 together.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.

I envisage making announcements in relation to budgets or allocations for the various housing programmes, including the retrofitting programme, in early March.  Under the 2011 programme, an allocation of &euro;925,000 was made available to Fingal County Council in respect of the energy efficiency and retrofitting measure.  Over the course of 2011, a total of &euro;926,716 was recouped to the council by my Department.  Under the same programme, an allocation of &euro;1,420,000 was made available to Tipperary South Riding County Council in respect of the energy efficiency and retrofitting measure.  Over the course of 2011, a total of &euro;1,089,481 was recouped by my Department on foot of payment claims received from the Council.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &mdash; 2010, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission. Any development that is carried out without planning permission, or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission, is unauthorised development, and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority.</P>
        <P>Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts. A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development). There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.  There is however generally a 7 year limitation period on the taking of enforcement action: such action may not be taken, in the case of a development with no permission, after 7 years from the commencement of the development, and in the case of a development which was granted permission after seven years beginning on the expiration of the duration of the permission.</P>
        <P>An application for retention permission is required to be assessed by a planning authority in the same way as any other application, that is, the planning authority is required to consider <Col N="294"/>the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>The facility to apply for retention permission was curtailed in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 which provided that a planning authority may not accept an application for retention permission in respect of a development which would have required that one or more of the following was carried out:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />an environmental impact assessment;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a determination as to whether an environmental impact assessment was required; or</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />an appropriate assessment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The above provision was commenced on 23 March 2011.  Section 57 of the 2010 Act makes provision to allow developments which would have required an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment to be the subject of applications for substitute consent, but only in very limited circumstances e.g. the development had a permission which was found defective by a court or An Bord Plean&aacute;la consider that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant the granting of leave to apply for substitute consent.</P>

	<P>The Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund, which has been in operation since 1997, promotes sustainable development by assisting small scale, non-profit environmental projects at local level.  The scheme attracts significant interest throughout the country; a total of 515 projects were funded by the scheme in 2011.  Funds provided by my Department are matched by the relevant local authority and it is also recommended that this combined funding be supplemented, where possible, by other funding sources, such as private sector funding, to maximise the potential of partnership arrangements.</P>
        <P>Each local authority is responsible for its own staffing arrangements and my Department does not maintain a list of local authority staff that have been nominated as Local Agenda 21 (LA21) Officers or Environmental Awareness Officers (EAOs).  In some local authorities the role of LA21 Officer may be assigned to a staff member who is also assigned the role of EAO.</P>
        <P>The EAOs in local authorities actively promote positive action to protect our environment and work closely with schools, community groups and members of the public.  My Department facilitates periodic meetings of a network of EAOs, including some LA21 officers, for the purpose of sharing of information and best practice in environmental matters.  Guest speakers are invited to address the meetings on a variety of topical environmental issues.  The network also communicates regularly via email.</P>
        <P>The amounts allocated to each local authority for the years 2002 to 2011 are set out in the table below.  The information sought prior to 2002 is not readily available and compilation of this information would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.  The LA21 scheme has been funded from the Environment Fund since 2003; prior to that it was funded through the Department&rsquo;s Vote allocation.</P>
        <P>The operation of the scheme is kept under constant review; each year the outcome of individual projects is monitored through completion reports which must be submitted for all projects funded under the scheme. A wide variety of projects are funded under the scheme and it provides support for local, environmentally beneficial projects, which might otherwise be difficult for the community to undertake.  A breakdown of the project types funded in 2011 is as follows:</P>

Under the scheme each local authority is allocated a specified amount, however, in some cases they may not all use their full allocation and in other cases may use none of their allocation (i.e. the nil amounts above).  Amounts not used by individual local authorities are subsequently offered to the other local authorities and redistributed to where there is demand.</P>

        <P>My Department did not, either directly or via PAS, advertise any vacancies in national newspapers in the period concerned.   However, two new entrants, recruited via PAS but from existing recruitment panels, joined my Department during this time.</P>
        <P>My Department uses internal redeployment and streamlining of business areas to ensure optimum staffing in priority business areas.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been early movers in terms of staff reductions, reducing from 37,243 whole-time equivalents (WTE) in 2008 to 29,744 WTE in December, 2011 &mdash; a reduction of 7,499 WTE (20%). Staff numbers in state agencies under the aegis of my Department have fallen from 951 at end 2008 to 803 at the end of 2011 &mdash; a reduction of 148 WTE (16%).</P>
        <P>The moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service was introduced in March 2009. When vacancies arise, public bodies must reallocate staff and/or re-organise work or staff accordingly.  My Department operates a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities.  Any local authority exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from my Department.</P>
        <P>In relation to state agencies under the aegis of my Department all requests for recruitment must be agreed with my Department and also require sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for County and City Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.</P>
        <P>In considering local authority sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services and economic issues are given precedence as is the requirement to avoid increases in overall staffing levels.</P>

	<P>In July 2011 I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.  In broad terms the measures will involve:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</P>
        <P LI="1">(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Mandatory certification, lodgement of drawings and improved inspection arrangements as outlined above are key reforms which, I believe, will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Efficiency Review Group recommended in its Report in July 2010 that a single building inspectorate service could be established on a regional basis to streamline the approach to the inspection of property.  The matter is being kept under review in the context of the above-mentioned actions being taken at Department and at Local Authority levels to further the development of the Building Control function.</P>
        <P>Building Regulations set out the legal minimum performance standards which a completed building (including a dwelling) must achieve.  Building Control Regulations deal with procedural matters relating to the administration of the Building Control function.  Both sets of regulations are subject to ongoing review by my Department in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).</P>

	<P>The primary purpose of social housing support is to ensure that persons and families who do not have sufficient resources to provide accommodation themselves to meet their needs are provided with adequate housing for their needs.</P>
        <P>Regulation 22 of Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that an applicant household for long-term social housing support is ineligible for social housing support if a household member owns alternative accommodation that could meet their needs, either through occupation or through the proceeds of selling that accommodation. Part 11 of the prescribed social housing application form therefore asks for information on applicants&rsquo; current and past property ownership either in the State or abroad.</P>
        <P>In seeking to determine the eligibility for social housing support the housing authority may seek additional documentation from applicants. It is a matter for the local authority to determine what is required in individual cases.</P>

Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, an executive office within my Department, has examined the Convention and has requested observations on potential policy and legislative implications from relevant government departments and state agencies.  Following receipt of the observations, consideration will be given to any issues which need to be addressed.

	<P>Claims from property owners for damage caused to their properties arising from searches undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are delegated to and managed by the State Claims Agency.  Each claim is considered separately depending on the particular facts of the case.</P>
        <P>The general policy of the State Claims Agency, however, in relation to such claims is that where the Garda&iacute; cause damage to property in conducting a search, any claim from the property owner in respect of that damage is contested provided the Garda&iacute; were acting on foot of a valid search warrant.  Search warrants authorise the Garda&iacute; to use force to gain entry to a property if necessary and the Garda&iacute; have no legal liability to the property owner for the damage caused in forcing entry to the property.  The approach taken by the State Claims Agency in denying liability and contesting these claims has been upheld by the Courts in a number of claims brought to Court by property owners.</P>

	<P>The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) provides that the Private Security Authority (PSA) is the regulatory body responsible for the regulation and licensing of the security industry in Ireland. The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department.</P>
        <P>The PSA undertook a phased roll out of licensing of the private security industry.  It commenced licensing of contractors in 2006 and this was followed by the licensing of certain individuals in 2007.  I understand that there are, at present, almost 750 licensed contractors and over 27,000 licensed individuals operating in the security industry.  Licensing of the remaining sub-sectors of the industry is expected to be completed in the coming years.  The transformation which regulation has brought about to date, in just over 7 years, has been significant with many positive benefits for both the industry, the wider business community and the public alike.</P>
        <P>As regards the legislation itself, the 2004 Act was amended, last August, by the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2011.  These amendments strengthen certain financial, licensing and enforcement functions of the Authority and came about following lessons learned by the Authority from its operations to date.</P>
        <P>As the Authority continues its work and further expands its operations, no doubt further lessons will be learned.  However, given the relatively short timeframe in which the Authority <Col N="304"/>has been operating, the phased roll out of its licensing to date and the enactment of the legislative amendments last year, I have no current plans to review the operation of the 2004 Act.  I am of course open to considering such a review in the future, should the need arise.</P>

	<P>The allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of court cases and the management of court lists are matters for the judiciary and in particular the Presidents of the courts and it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment in relation to this matter. The Deputy will be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>
        <P>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the waiting times for family law cases in the Circuit Court in Bray Co Wicklow are between eight and nine months.  The Deputy will appreciate that all court cases are listed in such a way as to make optimum use of court time.  I am informed, for example, that a presiding Judge may give priority to criminal matters where defendants may be in custody particularly in circumstances where there may be longer waiting times for criminal trials.</P>
        <P>It should be noted there are currently five vacancies on the Circuit Court while two additional vacancies will occur on 29 February, and three Circuit Court judges are assigned to the Mahon Tribunal.  I am currently awaiting recommendations from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board in respect of the current vacancies.  Following receipt of those recommendations, the Government will make nominations to fill the vacancies as soon as possible which will have a substantial impact on court waiting times.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past few years strong legislative, administrative and operational measures have been put in place to combat and prevent trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  Section 5 of the Act makes it an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, public or private for the purposes of prostitution.  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State&rsquo;s response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  This led to the production of a National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons for the period from June 2009 to December 2012 setting out 144 Actions of which  97 were completed or significantly progressed at the end of 2011 with a further 47 on-going.  </P>
        <P>In addition to the dedicated Unit in my Department there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue &mdash; the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau; the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive  and a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board.  Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Director of Public Prosecutions Office.  All persons encountered or referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as victims are immediately offered access to a range of services provided by the State including accommodation, medical care, psychological assistance, legal aid and advice, and crime prevention advice.There are a wide range of training and awareness raising activities <Col N="307"/>on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-Governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.</P>
        <P>The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill contains statutory protections for victims of trafficking and also provides for recovery and reflection periods and temporary residence permission for persons whom a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of Superintendent, considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is a victim of human trafficking.  These provisions are reflected in Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking which have been in place since the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008.  The law in relation to human trafficking and prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities have conducted a number of operations to combat human trafficking and prostitution and will continue to do so in line with intelligence available to them.  Trafficking in human beings is again a policing priority this year, as it has been in recent years.  A number of prosecutions have been secured for trafficking and related offences. The details for 2009 and 2010 are set out in data reports published by my Department.  The 2011 report is currently being compiled.  A number of cases are also before the Courts.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with other police forces which has resulted in offenders being convicted in other jurisdictions.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my response on 23/02/2012 to a similar question raised by Deputy Regina Doherty (10392/12), which is essentially repeated here.</P>
        <P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is charged with responsibility for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for protection are being processed. As of 12/02/2012, there were 5,313 accommodated in RIA centres located throughout the State, with a total of 573 persons living at the Mosney centre.</P>
        <P>The number of asylum seekers requiring accommodation now and the likely number in the future are under constant review and it is not possible at this stage to predict what particular accommodation facilities will be required in the short or medium term future. There are no immediate plans to change existing arrangements at the Mosney Centre. In accordance with standard procedures RIA will shortly be entering into discussions with the contractor at Mosney in the context of the expiry of the current contract in June this year.  Plainly, it is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome of those discussions will be.</P>

By way of correspondence dated 15 December 2010 the Adjudicator clarified to both my Department and PDFORRA that three of his adjudication reports which found in favour of PDFORRA could not be implemented while the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009 was in place.</P>

	<P>A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated the population of wild mink in the State could reach a total of between 20,500 and 33,500 individuals, and identified ground-nesting birds as the species most vulnerable to mink predation.  Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species, including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns, from a range of predators, including mink.   Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these bird species.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the particular funding referred to by the Deputy, I requested, in granting the funding in question to the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC), that, as far as it is possible, special attention should be given to the counties of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry to enhance work in those areas where my Department has been concentrating its own efforts.</P>
        <P>My Department is particularly aware of the potential impacts of mink control on non-target species, especially otter, pine marten and stoat. The funding, therefore, is being provided to the NARGC with a strong reminder that these other species are protected. Accordingly, even accidental capture of such species while targeting mink would be an offence and only acceptable legal forms of live traps can be used, with snares and fentraps expressly forbidden.</P>

	<P>China is a key strategic market for Irish exports of food seafood and beverages and presents significant opportunities for other exports. Exports of Irish food and beverages to China are estimated in 2011 at &euro;215m, including exports of hides and skins. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Since taking office as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have sought to foster close relationships with my Ministerial counterparts in China and between officials from our respective administrations to further areas of mutual cooperation and to advance and facilitate market access opportunities in China. In May last year, the Agriculture Vice Minister, Niu Dun visited Ireland and was shown at first hand our agricultural production systems, our high food safety standards and veterinary controls and our state of the art laboratories. This visit culminated in the signing of an Action Plan in relation to mutual cooperation in the agri-food and fisheries areas which is being implemented at present.</P>
        <P>When Vice President Xi Jinping visited Ireland between 18 and 20 February, he specifically asked to visit a farm in Ireland and I had wide ranging discussions with him on China&rsquo;s concerns regarding food security. In his discussions with the Taoiseach, he outlined proposals for further development of the relationship between China and Ireland, including practical cooperation and exchanges in various fields such as agriculture. He also specifically highlighted the area of Animal Husbandry as an area in which China had a particular interest in learning from Ireland.  Ireland is viewed as a country with very high food safety standards and veterinary controls, as a leading expert in areas of traceability, public health controls, genetic improvements, grass land management, feeding systems and in sustainable production systems, particularly in relation to meat and dairy production. China has a particular interest in these areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would hope that in my proposed trade Mission to China, which will take place from 15-22 April, we can further explore and deepen these levels of cooperation and trust that have developed between our two countries in the agriculture and fisheries areas.</P>
        <P>In relation to two way investments, a number of Irish agri-food companies are already present in China and have made investments in setting up companies in China. Further investment decisions will be a matter for Irish food companies and their Chinese partners.</P>
        <P>In relation to international investment in Ireland, I have identified, in relation to the Fisheries sector, the development of deep sea aquaculture as a means of expanding the production of organic farmed salmon.  This will contribute to increased exports of fish and provide significant direct and indirect employment in vulnerable coastal communities. Ireland would welcome international interest in investing in Ireland&rsquo;s proposed large scale deep sea salmon farming, including that from China.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Single Payment Scheme, Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other area-based schemes, are fully and partially funded by the European Union.  The relevant Competent Authorities in each Member State are obliged to ensure that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are observed and that only valid applications that fully comply with the requirements are paid.  The administration of these Schemes in each Member State is subjected to <Col N="316"/>close scrutiny by officials of the EU Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met and that the Schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union. </P>
        <P>The requirements provide that payments under the Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land.  Applicants under these Schemes are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them.  The details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) and the Department continually monitors details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system.</P>
        <P>My Department, in the context of delivering the Direct Payments Schemes, is required to carry out annual inspections covering land eligibility and cross compliance to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements.  The value of these schemes to Irish farmers is &euro;1.8bn annually.  It is therefore incumbent on my Department to ensure that the regulatory control environment is comprehensively implemented to avoid EU disallowances.</P>

	<P>It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland&rsquo;s total land area.  From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission.</P>
        <P>The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the &euro;30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This reduction will arise from technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable &mdash; 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers, who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.</P>
        <P>There are an increasing number of applicants under the Scheme, who have discontinued livestock (cattle or sheep) farming, but who continue to benefit from aid under the Scheme by grazing some horses on their land. It is proposed that horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation on the basis that these applicants&rsquo; contribution to the rural economy is minimal. However, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy. My officials have engaged with the horse industry representatives in order to agree on criteria that would mean that those equine breeding enterprises (irrespective of their size), who are making a valuable contribution to the local economy will continue to receive support.</P>

	<P>The Foal Levy Scheme was introduced in 2000 on a statutory basis, the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999, refers. The Levy is payable by all breeders whose thoroughbred foals are born and registered in Ireland. The scheme is administered by Horse Racing Ireland, the State body with responsibility for the thoroughbred sector. </P>
        <P>The proceeds of the levy are used by Horse Racing Ireland to help fund the Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. These organisations provide key support structures to the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>The rate of the levy is calculated by reference to the advertised value of the nomination fee of the stallion in accordance with the provisions of the Thoroughbred Foal Levy Regulations, 2011, S.I. No. 735 of 2011. The amount of the nomination fee actually paid does not enter into the calculation, for example if a situation were to arise that a mare was covered free of charge the owner would still be liable to pay a levy based on the advertised value of the nomination fee of the stallion before the thoroughbred foal could be registered in the studbook.</P>
        <P>There are 11 levy rate bands. The setting of the rates of the Levy and the distribution of the funds is decided by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland based on the advice of its Foal Levy Committee which includes representatives of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association (ITBA) and the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association (IFA).</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;advertised value&rdquo; of the nomination fee of the stallion is the same as the covering fee generally applicable as notified by the stallion owner to HRI for the purposes of calculating the Levy. Horse Racing Ireland, in consultation with the Foal Levy Committee and breeders representatives, made, with my approval, a number of changes to the Foal Levy rates and bands for all registrations with effect from 1 January 2012.   However, all registrations in 2011 or earlier would have attracted levy at the then existing rates.  There is no question of any refunds of levies already paid in previous years because of the new rates and bands that came into effect from 1st January 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past year, I and my Department have been extremely active in raising the question of an adjustment to the milk quota regime at every appropriate opportunity.  We have made determined efforts to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German and Estonian counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  We will continue to pursue this matter over the coming months.</P>
        <P>Among the options discussed in relation to a soft landing are the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, a further reduction in butterfat correction <Col N="321"/>levels, or a kind of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would operate provided EU production overall was within quota.  Most attention has been focussed on the butterfat correction, and in December a coalition of Member States involving Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus formally put a specific proposal to the Special Committee for Agriculture for an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  This is a view which is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.</P>
        <P>Irish dairy farmers must therefore continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the milk quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.  This is extremely important, and I cannot emphasise the point strongly enough.  Milk deliveries in the 2010/2011 milk quota year were only just below quota, and deliveries in 2011/2012 to date continue to run almost on quota.  With a super levy an increasing likelihood in the final years before quota abolition, all dairy farmers must carefully plan their production activities and pay close attention to the limitations imposed by the quota regime if they are to avoid potentially ruinous super levy fines.</P>

	<P>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the reform of the CAP post-2013 include a proposal to gradually move away from payments based on historical production towards a system of uniform national or regional payment rates by 2019. The mechanism proposed raises serious concerns for Ireland, in that it would result in very significant transfers from more productive farms to more marginal and less productive land.</P>
        <P>Analysis carried out by my Department indicates that, under a national flat-rate model, the most productive farmers would lose, on average, about one-third of their current payments, while the least productive farmers would see their payments rise by an average of 86%. Alternative redistributions based on a two-region model, or even an eight-region model, would have similar outcomes. I do not believe that these are compatible with my commitment to sustainable intensification of production, the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy and the achievement of the objectives of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</P>
        <P>I have been relaying these concerns very strongly at every opportunity in recent months, most recently in the course of discussions with the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dacian Ciolos, during his visit to Dublin last month. I pressed for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions, and to include the possibility of lengthy transition periods. The &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards the average, and which the Commission itself has adopted in the distribution of funds between Member States, is one alternative that is currently being examined.</P><Col N="322"/>
        <P>I will continue to work intensively with the Commissioner, and with my counterparts at the Council of Ministers, to achieve the required flexibility and to come up with an acceptable solution that does not have the dramatic redistributive effects inherent in the current proposals.</P>

	<P>Despite the on-going serious difficulties in the public finances, a total funding of &euro;1,312m is being provided in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2012, &euro;1,144m in current and &euro;168m for capital expenditure. On the capital side, the 2012 capital allocation will be boosted by a further &euro;27m by way of carry-over of savings from 2011 to provide total capital funding next year of &euro;195m. The funding announced in the 2012 Estimates does not include the &euro;1.3b in payments under EU funded schemes which are administered by the Department.</P>
        <P>This funding commitment is a strong statement of the Government&rsquo;s support for the agri-food sector and recognition of the contribution which the sector can make to economic recovery and future growth in the Irish economy.   The schemes and programmes which underpin this funding aim to protect farm incomes by targeting existing resources at active farmers, support productivity and the up skilling of farmers and the food sector with a view to developing and ensuring maximum return for the Irish agri-food sector in line with Food Harvest 2020. I believe that the agri-food sector will continue to be one of the strongest performing sectors of the economy this year creating new jobs and building further on the outstanding export performance in 2011.</P>

	<P>Currently carbon credits accrue only to new forests planted after 1990.  It is the Government&rsquo;s view that carbon credits are owned by the State, irrespective of the owner of the land.

Our submission will be informed by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, which recommended three priority areas for Ireland in its efforts to address global hunger: 1) support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Africa; 2) addressing maternal and infant undernutrition, and 3) strengthening international political commitment to addressing Hunger.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made steady progress in implementing the Hunger Task Force recommendations.  Through our overseas development programme, Irish Aid, we support a comprehensive range of programmes to sustainably improve food and nutrition security of the poorest and most vulnerable.  For example, in Malawi, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; organisations to improve soil fertility and diversify to more nutritious crops; in Tanzania, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; access to better farm inputs such as seeds and fertiliser; and in Lesotho, we support smallholder farmers to develop vegetable gardens to improve household nutrition.  At the international level, we work to ensure that global agricultural research is focused on the needs of women smallholder farmers, and that research outputs are readily available to the poorest farmers.</P>

	<P>The Government currently supports the provision of early childhood care and education through three support programmes &mdash; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme.  These programmes are implemented by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme supports only community-based childcare services by enabling them to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  These not-for-profit facilities provide childcare at cost price with reductions to qualifying parents based on the level of subvention they are entitled to under the programme.</P>
        <P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State is participating in the programme, ensuring it is available to children in all areas.</P>
        <P>The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010.  Under the CETS programme, funding is provided by my Department to participating childcare services in return for the provision of free childcare places to qualifying students and trainees.  The eligibility criteria under which students and trainees qualify under the programme is determined by F&Aacute;S and the VECs.</P>
        <P>The ECCE and CETS programmes are available in both community and commercial childcare services.  In December 2011, the Government announced a new National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) Capital Funding 2012 grant.  This grant will provide capital funding of &euro;6m this year to both community and private childcare providers currently participating in one or more of the above funding programmes: CCS programme; CETS programme and ECCE programme.  The funding is available for small maintenance/renovation work or equipment and the maximum grant available to qualifying applicants is &euro;50,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The domestic adoption process in Ireland is managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  Persons may apply in the first instance to the HSE for an assessment of eligibility and suitability to adopt.  The HSE will undertake such an assessment and prepare a report for consideration by an Adoption Committee.  The Adoption Committee is established by the HSE under Section 36 of the Adoption Act, 2010.  The Committee makes a recommendation to the AAI on the suitability of the applicant.  The Authority, following consideration of the recommendation of the Adoption Committee will make a determination on whether to issue a declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt.  Much of the preparatory process work is undertaken by the HSE with appropriate guidance from the AAI, which is the ultimate decision maker in determining eligibility and suitability.  The cost of providing this service is met from within the respective financial allocations to the AAI and the HSE. In the case of the AAI the cost is met from within the Authority&rsquo;s overall allocation of &euro;3.3 million in 2012.  I have asked the HSE to provide an estimate of the cost of this service and I will revert to the Deputy on the matter. </P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The umbrella term of domestic adoption encompasses a number of different types of adoption, including a very small number of infant placements with non-familial applicants, step-parent/family adoptions and the adoption of children in long term foster care by their foster parents.  The domestic adoption <Col N="330"/>process in all of its forms is inherently complex due to a variety of factors including constitutional and legal requirements in relation to the placement of children, the requirement to consult birth fathers and consent requirements.  Each individual case presents a unique set of circumstances and issues to be addressed.  For this reason it is not possible to provide any reliable average length of time for the process.  However, the HSE estimates that the process may take up to 8 months, depending on the individual circumstances of the case.  I have been advised by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that in 2010 there were 153 applications received and 189 Orders made for domestic adoptions. In 2011 there were 47 applications and 39 Orders made for domestic adoptions.</P>

	<P>Ireland now has a nationwide network of successful youth caf&eacute;s which are mainly volunteer led although support and expertise from the youth sector can often be a key component in the initial stages of development.  The volunteer aspect is however an essential component if facilities are to be viable and sustainable in the medium to long term.  In addition, involving young people in the management and running of Youth Caf&eacute;s in partnership with adults is core to the on-going long term sustainability success of a youth caf&eacute;.  My Department is encouraging and supporting this approach through its interaction with youth organisations at national level, with Vocational Education Committees at regional level and with youth services at local level.</P>
        <P>The capital funding options provided by my Department to date for youth caf&eacute;s have been utilised for the refurbishment, redecoration, fitting out or adaptation of buildings as well as providing for the purchase of necessary equipment.  I anticipate that any future youth caf&eacute; funding initiatives will also primarily be for capital based expenditure and will not extend to supporting staff costs to operate these caf&eacute;s.</P>

	<P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  About 66,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.</P>
        <P>Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 qualified for the free pre-school year in September 2011 and children born in July and August of 2008 will qualify for the programme in September 2012. This child will therefore be eligible to avail of the ECCE <Col N="332"/>programme in September 2012.  There are no exceptions for children who are below the qualifying age.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</P>
        <P>My Department also implements the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Parents who consider that they qualify for support under the this programme should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee to establish exactly what participating community facilities are available in their area.  Westmeath County Childcare Committee may be contacted by telephone at 044 9335454 or by e-mail at <i>info@westmeathchildcare.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The General Register Office (Oifig An Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheora) is the central repository for records relating to Births, Deaths and Marriages in the Republic of Ireland. Under the Adoption Act 2010, the Adoption Authority of Ireland is responsible for sending particulars to an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir for entries in the Adopted Children Register.  An abridged certificate (a short birth certificate) currently available from the GRO, does not disclose that the person to whom the certificate relates is an adopted person. However, it is acknowledged that this short birth certificate contains, in essence, only the name and date of birth of the person.  In the Adoption Act, 2010, Section 89 provides that the Minister for Social Protection may, following consultation with myself, make regulations to provide that An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir in relation to any entry in the Adopted Children&rsquo;s Register may issue a certificate of such particulars contained in the entry as may be specified in the regulations. Section 89(2) provides that in making any such regulations, the certificate may not disclose that the person to whom the certificate relates is an adopted person.  In relation to the making of these regulations I will raise it with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection and bring the ongoing difficulties being experienced by adopted people to her attention. </P>
        <P>Heads of Bill in respect of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill are at an advanced stage and there is ongoing consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office in relation to the Heads.  The new legislation will provide a structured legal framework to support adopted people and birth parents who are seeking information and who wish to trace one another.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 638, 639 and 643 together.</P>
        <P>The primary school sector is a homogenous sector with a workforce holding the same qualifications and teaching the same primary school curriculum.  The model of implementation for Aistear in the primary school system is to establish a network of Aistear tutors who are themselves teachers and would deliver training in Aistear to other teachers.  My Department is in discussion with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) on what model should be used for the Early Years sector.  The Early Years sector is a diverse sector that operates across a wide range of curricular philosophical bases, e.g., Montessori, Steiner, High/Scope.</P>
        <P>As a preparatory step, the NCCA has been developing resources on Aistear for use in the Early Years sector and are working with Early Childhood Ireland on developing exemplars of good practice.e National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy was formally launched by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, on 8th July 2011.  Officials from my Department worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of the Strategy, and I welcome the recognition in the Strategy of the role of early childhood care and education.  The free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which is implemented by my Department is the key connection point between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills.  The introduction of universal pre-school provision brought with it a requirement that early years practitioners would achieve a qualification at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) by June 2012.  My Department is committed to incentivising the early years sector to acquire additional skills in oral language competency development for young children once this minimum requirement is met.  The ECCE programme will continue to be the catalyst for implementing the Workforce Development Plan through the Department of Education and Skills officials who are co-located within my Department.</P>

	<P>Early childhood training programmes are designed to ensure that practitioners have the skills and competencies to provide for the holistic and developmental needs of babies and young children.  The continuing validity of all training programmes is kept under review by the relevant Awarding bodies.  The process of programme development and validation in further and higher education is as follows:</P><Col N="336"/>
        <P LI="1">1.  An application for programme development is made by a training provider to an awarding body, i.e., FETAC, HETAC or a University or IoT with delegated authority.  The application will include rationale/identified need for the programme, proposed content, level of award, duration, delivery methods, assessment methods and quality assurance details.</P>
        <P LI="1">2.  Programme Development.  Upon approval by the relevant awarding body, the education and training provider will develop the programme according to their proposal and will submit the detailed content for validation by the awarding body.</P>
        <P LI="1">3.  Programme validation.  Programme validation is usually for a specified period of time after which programme review processes will have to be undertaken towards renewal of validation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In line with this process and as set out in the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, my Department will work with the Awarding Bodies and other Government Departments to ensure that training courses in early childhood care and education continue to have validity.</P>

	<P>The Workforce Development Plan for the Early Childhood Care and Education sector set out the key areas that emerged from an extensive programme of research and consultation:  These key areas are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The necessity for clearly articulated professional pathways into and across professional domains of practice related to the care and education of children. These include occupational role descriptors with associated qualification levels.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The establishment of an agreed set of national standards for all awards in early childhood care and education (incorporating core knowledge, skills, competencies and work experience) across all relevant levels of the National Framework of Qualifications in Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Access to flexible, affordable and nationally accredited learning opportunities at all levels of qualification for pre-service and in-service professional development.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The necessity to ensure consistent quality of ECCE courses nationally across a range of variables including content, delivery and work placement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The publication by FETAC of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications will ensure that there is consistent quality of ECCE courses across the country and will deliver on one of the key areas set out in the Workforce Development Plan.  I view this as an essential building block for developing and upskilling the workforce.</P>

        <Quest> if he is sure that the fluoridation of public water supplies does not have a negative impact on human health; if he can point to any research to support the case for the continuation of this practice; if his attention has been drawn to the research that highlights adverse effects of fluoridation on public health; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Forum on Fluoridation, which reported in 2002, advised that the fluoridation of piped public water supplies should continue as a public health measure. One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations, 1965 to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm. Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.</P>
        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, has among its functions to evaluate all new and emerging issues on fluorides and health. The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. The report of the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published in June 2011, has not made any findings of negative health or environmental effects concerning fluoridation of water. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Funding is included in the HSE Capital Plan to provide for planned infrastructural developments for the National Forensic Mental Health Service.  These include the development of a new 120 bed hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital (CMH), the development of a 10 bed Intellectual Disability Forensic Mental Health Unit, a 10 bed Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit, as well as four regional Intensive Care Rehabilitation Units (ICRUs).</P>
        <P>It is planned to build the new CMH, the Intellectual Disability and Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Units at Portrane, Co Dublin.  The HSE has sought expressions of interest for the design team for this project and it is hoped that work on the design will commence in the coming months.  It is envisaged that construction will start in 2014 and the facility will be completed and operational by 2016.</P>
        <P>The regional ICRUs will be located at appropriate locations around the country and will serve as a gateway between the community mental health service and the forensic service.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware the HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012, and in the case of Community Nursing Units these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.   It is clear that on a business as usual basis, the HSE would have to close further beds across a range of public community nursing units in 2012.  In the absence of reform, this would increase the cost of caring for older persons within the public system, undermine the viability of public community nursing units and reduce the overall number of older persons that can be supported within the budget available for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. This is not a sustainable way forward and would not meet the needs of older persons, local communities, the taxpayer or those working in the public service.</P>
        <P>The Minister has requested that the HSE provide him with a plan which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available, including smaller units where challenges of scale may require more innovative approaches to service delivery.  It is accepted that this will require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services; changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices; age and structure of public units etc. It will also have to take into account different types of services required and the capacity available within an area. The HSE is already examining issues in this regard and will be working closely with the Department to develop an overall set of proposals for the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Health Service Executive to deliver services both nationally and locally within its budget; and overall health policy priorities in line with the overall resources available <Col N="342"/>to it.   The Executive is currently examining the future use and development of public nursing homes in Co. Louth, taking into account the potential of these units to comply with HIQA standards.  In this regard a project group held its first meeting Tuesday, 24th January. The group is working on an optimal appraisal for the most appropriate service delivery model for residential care for Older People in Co Louth.  It has agreed a framework, with mid-March as the expected time for completion.</P>
        <P>Finally I would like to reassure the Deputy that should there be concern for the future of any unit, the HSE will engage fully in a local consultation process with all stakeholders before any decision is taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>The HSE&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) is responsible for the payment of fees and allowances to <Col N="343"/>general practitioners (GPs) who are contracted by the HSE to provide services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  </P>
        <P>The PCRS does not pay GPs for the provision of phlebotomy services.  Blood tests carried out as part of the general treatment of a patient are covered by the GMS contract with GPs.</P>
        <P>At my request, the HSE wrote to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in this regard.  The letter to GPs pointed out that, where the practice based phlebotomy service forms part of the investigation and necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions by the patient&rsquo;s GP, the service should be provided free of charge where the patient is a medical card or GP visit card holder.  I would encourage patients to follow up with the HSE if they believe they are being wrongly charged for services by their GP and the matter will be fully investigated by the Executive.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE&rsquo;s Consumer Affairs Service.  In a number of cases to-date, the GP has reimbursed patients following receipt of correspondence from the HSE.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 662 and 663 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.  The aim of this reform is to deliver a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.</P>
        <P>A fundamental element in the reform process involves significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access to General Practitioner (GP) services.   I have established the Universal Primary Care Project Team, which has been tasked with working through the issues relating to the introduction of this commitment.  The Project Team is meeting on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>Universal primary care will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals. Initially, free GP cover will be extended to persons in receipt of drugs and medicines under the Long Term Illness Scheme. Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.   There will be an announcement in due course about the start date for this arrangement.</P>
        <P>The Department commissioned research to develop a model of demand for and supply of GP and practice nurse services. The outcome is a functional and  adaptable excel model rather than any specific set of findings.  The Project Team will make use of the model in the course of its work.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 665 and 669 together.</P>
        <P>At present, doctors who wish to pursue a career in General Practice must obtain a place on a 4 year vocational training course.  Time spent on hospital rotation is not recognised for this purpose.  &ldquo;Fast track&rdquo; training refers to a potential programme for doctors who have already gained some of the required hospital rotation experience through General Professional Training and who now wish to become GPs, but do not have access to GP Specialist training.  No such programme currently exists in Ireland but the HSE is working with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) to develop such a training programme.  It is envisaged that fast track training will be managed and delivered through the existing bodies that provide GP training.</P>
        <P>In addition, the HSE and ICGP have reached agreement on an alternative route to specialist registration for doctors who have extensive experience in General Practice, but who lack some component of training to become eligible for specialist registration as a General Practitioner.  Details of this &ldquo;practice based assessment model&rdquo; were published on the ICGP website in September 2011.  The ICGP has advertised for personnel to implement the alternative model and this recruitment process is ongoing.</P>
        <P>In 2009, there were 120 general practice postgraduate training places available.  In 2010, that number was increased to 157.   Funding for GP training nationally is &euro;19.5m.</P>
        <P>The details of the GP trainee places from 2009 to the present, broken down by HSE Region, are set out in the tables below:</P>

Individual trip data are not readily available. Minister of State Shortall does not avail of a civilian driver. The basis on which Ministers record mileage does not require individual trips to be listed. </P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day-case surgery.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of consideration has been given to the issue of women who received potentially infectious batches of Anti D but who have neither tested positive for Hepatitis C, nor had a positive Tribunal decision in their favour.  While a number of these women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C have had, and may continue to have, a variety of symptoms, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression, are common conditions that occur in the general population. It is estimated that up to 16,000 women were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C.  </P>
        <P>Having taken account of international practice and the rationale which led to the clarification of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal eligibility requirements in 2006, I do not intend introducing a Statutory Instrument to extend the class or classes of persons eligible for compensation under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997.  While I am sympathetic to the women in question, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are fair and reasonable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group was published on 7 February last; and this recognises that while individuals are primarily responsible for their own behaviour, the State has a responsibility to foster the well being of its citizens &mdash; in addition to declaring that alcohol related harm increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.</P>
        <P>The alcohol content in alcoholic drinks produced by manufacturers is largely a function of market forces such as supply and demand; but of relevance to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is that at the outset, the Steering Group recommended that the low-risk weekly consumption guidelines of pure alcohol should be 168 grams and 112 grams for men and women respectively (the Irish standard drink is calculated at 10 grams); and that alcohol products should be labelled with calorific content, weight of alcohol content, and health warnings on drinking during pregnancy.</P>
        <P>Furthermore the Steering Group also recommended that excise duty rates on higher alcohol content products should be maintained at a higher rate than those on lower alcohol products to discourage consumption of higher alcohol content beverages.</P>
        <P>These recommendations of the Steering Group &mdash; including those above that are related to the alcohol content in alcoholic drinks &mdash; are encouraging public debate and I envisage an <Col N="352"/>Action Plan being developed in advance of proposals being drafted for Government later this year.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day-case surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means of the applicant and his/her dependants. </P>
        <P>At the request of my colleague, Dr James Reilly, Minister for Health, the HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  This should be of particular benefit to persons diagnosed with fibromyalgia whose income is in excess of the standard income guidelines.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to extend free GP services to the entire population during the course of this Government.</P>

	<P>Fibromyalgia is not one of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme and there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme</P>
        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with a physical and/or sensory disability.  Although the funding allocated to disability services has been cut by 3.7%, the HSE aims to maintain this level of service in 2012.  Service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation <Col N="360"/>with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service rather than reducing the number of hours or the pay of personal assistants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that there have been difficulties with the processing of medical card applications and renewals. These issues are a matter of serious concern and I have held several meetings with the HSE to raise my concerns.  As a result of these discussions, a number of changes are being introduced to the medical card application system.  These changes will assist in speeding up the turn around for applications by easing the level of pressure on the medical card system, particularly with respect to the review process which, due to the timing of the re-issuing, and hence review, of a large cohort of medical cards has placed a large demand on the resources of the centralised office.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the PCRS central office introduced a self assessment review process for people aged 70 years and over, as that cohort was managed entirely by the central office.  Following on from this development, the HSE has eased the review process for all pensioners. The change will mean that reviews for medical card holders who are aged 66 years or over will operate on a self-assessment basis, as currently happens with people aged 70 years and over. The self-assessment review model will also be extended to medical card holders under 66 years of age, who were granted their medical card on the basis of a means assessment, where the HSE is satisfied that the individual continues to be resident in this jurisdiction.</P><Col N="361"/>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is also standardising eligibility periods from two years to three years for people aged under 66 years, with a new four year eligibility period for medical card holders aged 66 years or over. Notwithstanding, there continues to be an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances which would disentitle them from holding a medical card at any time. The HSE is in the process of arranging access to data in the possession of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to allow it conduct reviews without troubling medical card holders for further documentation. It is also intended to increase the fine applying to false claims in forthcoming legislation.</P>
        <P>Discretionary cards, emergency cards and cards held by people in a small number of other categories will continue to be reviewed in the normal way, but the HSE are confident that the extension of the self assessment model to the great majority of medical card holders will simplify the process substantially, will improve the service to the client and will improve turnaround times for reviews. It is hoped that ultimately about 80% of renewals will be dealt with in this way. This new process also focuses attention on active users of the Medical Card to ensure that those most in need are involved in the streamlined process.</P>
        <P>The HSE has, this month, agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to implement a new system that gives GPs the additional ability to identify and assist the vulnerable medical card holders in our society.  GPs will be able to maintain the eligibility of these patients where they are going through the renewal system.  GPs will also be able to add new babies onto the medical card system.</P>
        <P>The PCRS central office is working to deal with some of the processing issues that have been arising. This has included reviewing and refining their systems for the receipt and logging of applications and documents being sent in as a result of requests for additional information. In addition, an additional 20 staff were redeployed to the central office in January to bring its complement up to 150 and this should make an impact on processing times.</P>
        <P>The HSE, for its part, has now accepted that it needs to review the overall operation of the central office with a view to ensuring that an acceptable level of service for the public is in place.  This review is being assisted by a consultancy firm which will review current processes, develop proposals for improvements of the processes and for improvements in customer service and it is due to be completed within a few weeks. I am continuing to engage with the HSE with regard to other possible improvements.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE for a report in the issue of length of time for processing applications and I will revert to the Deputy on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</P>
        <P>In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with physical and/or sensory disability. Although the funding allocated to disability services has been cut by 3.7%, the HSE aims to maintain this level of service in 2012. Service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service rather than reducing the number of hours or the pay of personal assistants.</P>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute <Col N="368"/>services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Jobs Initiative included a three-pronged plan to enhance overseas access and thereby promote inbound tourism through:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />abolishing the travel tax conditional on clear commitments by airlines to increase inbound capacity from our source markets;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of a new growth incentive scheme by the Dublin Airport Authority; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, DAA and the airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Subsequently, the Government agreed, in the absence of a sufficient response from the airlines, to retain the air travel tax and to avail of part of the receipts from its retention to fund additional cooperative marketing activities.  A &euro;9 million overseas tourism marketing campaign over the 2011/12 Autumn/Winter period was led by Tourism Ireland, inclusive of matching funding provided by partner companies, including Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann, overseas airlines, tour operators and online travel agents, and ferry companies.</P>
        <P>This initiative is not about one airline; the Government would like to see efforts made by all airlines serving the Irish market to increase capacity on inbound routes from key tourism markets.  While there has been some progress on additional access for summer season 2012, the Government is closely monitoring the capacity being made available and will decide whether to retain or abolish the travel tax.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that an additional 5 million passenger journeys through State Airports is not the same as 5 million additional inbound tourists.</P>

        <P>The Foynes line is included in the Core Network, for the moment,  on the basis of projected freight volumes. This line does not form part of the so-called &lsquo;Western Arc&rsquo;. Rather this is a short stretch of railway between the Shannon Foynes Port facility at Foynes, which already exists but was closed to traffic some years ago. The Foynes line will only be re-opened if it is clear that large volumes of freight will be transported on it. There are no proposals that the State would fund the re-opening of this line but rather it would be done on foot of private sector investment.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the unique characteristics of our network are taken into account so as to ensure we optimise the benefits and minimise the cost of these Regulations. This means ensuring that the Core and Comprehensive Networks can be developed in a manner that will assist our transports links with Europe whilst also ensuring that we do not give commitments that are neither realistic nor  financially tenable.</P>
        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the hearing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and Gaeltacht on 10 January 2012 where the Department&rsquo;s position was clearly set out and also the response of the Committee to the EU institutions on <Col N="373"/>foot of that hearing, which re-affirmed that position.   The Deputy should be aware that the existing sections of railway which serve Ballina and Westport are included on the Comprehensive Network as proposed by the Commission.</P>
        <P>It is very important to understand that this Directive is not an opportunity for Ireland to secure EU funds for investment. Rather it imposes legally binding and financially expensive obligations on us. Therefore, it is our policy to limit the number of routes included to those that do not need upgrading or for which there is a significant possibility of securing private sector investment.</P>

	<P>Last year, I introduced Regulations to make it compulsory for learner drivers to undertake lessons before sitting the driving tests.  This system, known as Essential Driver Training (EDT), is one of nine measures which together will add up to a Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS) for Ireland.  While I am aware that a number of Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) have registered objections to aspects of this system, I understand that ADIs were consulted on the introduction of EDT.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority (RSA) developed the measures for a GDLS, including EDT, during 2009 and 2010.  This process included a public consultation process.  The GDLS proposals were published in September of 2010.</P>
        <P>The RSA sought the views of ADIs around the country in the preparation of EDT, and engaged extensively with ADIs in advance of its introduction in order to inform them of the forthcoming requirements and address any issues arising.  In general, ADIs have strongly supported the principle of EDT.  I believe that the system benefits ADIs by providing clear objectives and expectations for each lesson, as well as making it harder for rogue instructors to operate. The RSA also established a Stakeholders Forum, which comprises the RSA and elected representatives of the ADIs, to discuss matters of interest.</P>
        <P>I am well aware that not all ADIs are happy with it.  The RSA keeps the operation of EDT under constant review and has committed to carrying out a full evaluation of the system after two years. ADIs and other stakeholders will have an opportunity to give feedback on any difficulties which may have arisen.  The scheme can then be revised, if necessary, to take account of any improvements which have been identified.</P>

	<P>I am advised that in December 2011, Galway City Councillors requested the officials of Galway City Council to arrange presentations on bus services in Galway City.  As the National Transport Authority (NTA) had recently undertaken and completed a review of the bus services in the city, the NTA and the City Council officials decided that it would be appropriate that the NTA would present the outcome of that review to the City Council.  </P>
        <P>A presentation was given by the NTA to the Council on 9th   January 2012. It dealt with the network review that had been completed; the proposed changes to the PSO (Public Service Obligation) network operated by Bus Eireann arising from that review and provided an update on various other initiatives being undertaken by the NTA.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P>Under the legislation  which established the NTA, the NTA are responsible for those public transport services which comprise the PSO network.

        <P>Furthermore in accordance with section 63(1) of the DTA Act 2008, the Authority has had extended to it the functions in relation to integrated ticketing schemes for all other areas of the State.</P>
        <P>I understand from the NTA, however,  that there are currently no plans to extend the Leap card integrated ticketing scheme to Galway or any other city or region outside the GDA.
