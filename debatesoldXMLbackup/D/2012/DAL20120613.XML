	<P>Since the election, the Government has announced a jobs initiative, a jobs protection budget and an action plan for jobs, all of which were meant to create approximately 100,000 jobs by 2016.  However, when one considers the Government&rsquo;s own statistics in a no-spin zone, the number of people who are unemployed continues to rise.  The quarterly national household survey released last week shows the number of Irish people in employment has fallen by approximately 38,900, which is a damning indictment of the Government&rsquo;s initiatives over the past 15 months.  Moreover, the unemployment rate has risen from approximately 14.1% to 14.8%, employment has fallen in nine of the 14 economic sectors over the past year and in a highly worrying trend, long-term unemployment has increased by a further 25,000, from 7.8% to 8.9%.  Consequently, the position continues to worsen significantly for many people.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach had stated he wanted his Ministers to become obsessed with jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Jobs for the boys.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, they have not become obsessed with jobs because unfortunately, the initiatives are not making any impact whatsoever.  I put it to the Taoiseach the initiatives the Government has taken have contributed to the worsening of the position.  At its most basic, the decision to reduce the capital investment programme resulted in a net loss of 8,000 construction jobs in labour-intensive capital projects, which is something that could have been avoided.  The increase in VAT only further dampened consumer demand in what already was a weak domestic economy.  Moreover, some of the initiatives that led to increased redundancy costs for employers constituted a further disincentive to job creation and to employment.  Above all, the failure to create any pressure on the banking sector to release funding to the SME sector, as evidenced by all reports and analysis, including that produced recently by Mr. John Trethowan in the credit review committee, gives further evidence regarding initiatives and a policy direction that have made this situation worse.</P>
        <P>The final statistic comes from the Minister for Finance, who in April of this year revised downwards significantly his predictions from one year ago of employment until 2015.  Last year, the Government predicted net job creation from 2011 to 2015 of 101,000 but this year it predicts a figure of 61,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please.  Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is a decline of 40,000.  This appeared under the radar, buried in the Department of Finance&rsquo;s own statistics released this April.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiatives are failing to make an impact and are not improving the position in respect of employment in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions at all.  Obviously the live register speaks for itself.  I am extremely unhappy at the numbers of people who are unemployed and why would I not be?  The entire effect of Government is to deal with the reality of the position the country faces.  This is compounded, as the Deputy is aware, by the impact outside the country in respect of the growth of other European economies.  As an exporting nation, it is extremely important for us to be involved in this regard.  The Government produced its jobs action programme in February.  Its purpose is to create 100,000 new jobs by 2016, which is the end of this period of government.  It contains 270 propositions, progress on which will be published on a quarterly basis.  The programme is being monitored and overseen by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>
        <P>Clearly, Deputy Martin is only too well aware of the difficulties faced by so many businesses, including retail and small businesses, in the context of indigenous confidence in Ireland, as well as access to finance from banks.  This is the reason the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is pursuing the partial loan credit guarantee scheme and the introduction of the micro-finance agency, proposals for which I expect to come before the Government next week with the capacity to leverage resources up to &euro;100 million for very small operators in that line.  This is the reason the Government did not increase income tax to avoid imposing additional taxes on work and employment.  This is the reason the Minister of State with specific responsibility for jobs and small businesses has involved himself deeply with the small business associations and with small operators.  His purpose is to bring about a realisation that help and assistance is available and that while this environment is economically difficult, there is a big movement in the labour market.  This movement comes off the live register into the world of work.  Unfortunately, the level on the register is too high and I regret that.</P>
        <P>At the other end of the spectrum, the change from F&Aacute;S to SOLAS, linked to the Department of Education and Skills, will become for further education what the opportunities in the HEA&rsquo;s universities are for young people, be they in TUS, JobBridge or Springboard, allowing them to get back into a process where they can retrain, upskill and change direction.  As Deputy Martin is well aware, when one speaks to any of the people involved in modern industry one learns that jobs and careers can change every three or four years.  It is very important that the system we have is able to deal with those changes.  It is true the number of unemployed is too high.  It fluctuates every summer, as the Deputy knows, with those who come off the back to education allowances, and so on.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s programme is a capital programme of &euro;17 billion.  We inherited an economy that was badly smashed up.  There was not, and is not, the money to do all the things we would like to do, or to spend effectively on job creation.  The Deputy is well aware that the Government now has to borrow  &euro;3 billion every year for Anglo Irish Bank.  Think of what we could do with that money if things had been different.</P>
        <P>That is the situation we have to deal with and we will continue to deal with it.  Jobs, job priorities and the creation of jobs are central to the Government&rsquo;s focus.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Problem solved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is dealing with it very badly.  That is the problem.  It is not about job career changes and so on but about access to employment and people getting jobs, people who are well qualified but unemployed, and long-term unemployed.</P>

	<P>Can we have a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Take the launch in February, for example, when the Government claimed it would create 100,000 jobs.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s documentation a month and a half later claimed there would be 61,000 jobs, some 40,000 of a difference.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the SME sector is hurting very badly and is not getting access to credit in spite of what the Taoiseach claimed.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because they have never been able to get access to finance from banks.  That is why both pillar banks committed to the Government each gave new lending of &euro;3.5 billion this year.  That is why they attend before the Economic Management Council on a regular basis.  Deputy Martin is insinuating that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should not introduce a partial loan credit guarantee scheme even though it might affect, to their benefit, more than 1,000 small firms which are looking for money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He ridicules the fact that more than 11,000 jobs were created in the hospitality sector as a result of the reduction in VAT.  He ridicules the suggestion that the Government should not increase income tax so that there would be no extra tax on jobs.  He ridicules the suggestion that, for example, the renegotiation of the memorandum of understanding with the troika meant the Government was able to restore the minimum wage which his Government reduced for 30,000 people on low incomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>How many jobs did you create?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>He ridicules the suggestion that the Government was also able to renegotiate with the troika to take more than 300,000 people from liability for the universal social charge.  These were the decisions his Government made which this one has to reverse.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;their overriding ambition is to have a job and be in gainful employment.  What the Government is doing, and making no apology for it, is shifting out of the rut of hopelessness we inherited to a situation where people can have, not only confidence but also see there is opportunity and that jobs can and will be created.  In the course of the six weeks of the referendum campaign we pointed out, time and again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>This morning we have a tale of two reports.  On the one hand there is the troika&rsquo;s sixth review of Ireland&rsquo;s bailout programme, which has yet again been given to parliamentarians in the Bundestag and leaked to the media before Members of this D&aacute;il or the public in this State have had any sight of it.  On the other, there is an ESRI report which was not an ESRI report, rather a working document which has been withdrawn from the State-sponsored organisation&rsquo;s website.   By any standards, it was a very shoddy piece of work.  It was based on data from 2004 and 2005.  It was not peer-reviewed internally or externally.  It has been spun and used by some people to create the impression that the hundreds of thousands of people who are out of work at the moment are somehow living a gilt-edged lifestyle.  I ask the Taoiseach to make clear in the D&aacute;il that he understands that is not the case.  There is no doubt that people at work are struggling to pay their bills.  We know that.  There is no doubt that people are struggling as a direct consequence of the policies the Government is pursuing.  The Taoiseach has accused other Members of this House of abdicating their responsibilities.  I want him to take responsibility for his position and for his decisions.</P>

	<P>I would like to begin by responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s comment about documentation being given to the Bundestag.  When the Minister for Finance brought the draft report before the Government yesterday, it was made perfectly clear that he had agreed to allow the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to access the document.  That is the normal procedure.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy McDonald is well aware, it is a requirement that copies of the reports be given to the funding countries.  Arising from the previous occasion, when a European Commission document was leaked, the Government made it clear that in future, such reports would be given simultaneously to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and that the reports would remain confidential until they had been completely signed off.  I want the Deputy to understand that it is not a case of taking particular documents and giving them to particular international committees.  That matter was rectified after the last leak.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond to the comments that have been made this morning about the ESRI document.  The ESRI is an independent organisation.  I could not and would not stand over any contact from the Government to an independent organisation saying that particular documentation must be withdrawn or taken down.  Why should I?  The manner in which the Government makes decisions to create employment and opportunities for our people and follows them up is the most important element of what we have as a society.  Of course I recognise that many people in this country are struggling.  Of course I understand the despair that some people feel.  I empathise with their frustration about the fact that the scale of their job expectations for themselves and their families is not being delivered as fast as we would like.  Of course I recognise that people in negative equity and those whose sons and daughters have gone to America, Australia, Britain or elsewhere are struggling.  There is no question about that.  There is clear evidence to indicate that people in Greece, Cyprus and Spain are struggling similarly.  People in many other countries are also worried.  This Government will accept its responsibility for the decisions it makes.  The Deputy can take it that the Government&rsquo;s priority is to deal with the central issue, which is the need for Ministers and Ministers of State in their Departments to focus continually on methods of job creation and opportunity for young and old people who want to get involved in their own areas and communities and contribute to this country.  I want the Deputy to understand that clearly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Taoiseach to understand that struggling families do not want his recognition, understanding or empathy.  They want the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues to take responsibility for the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.  More to the point, they want to see action that yields results for them and their families.  As the Taoiseach said, the ESRI is an independent organisation.  It receives substantial State funding.  Many people have been asking why this document was taken off the ESRI website.  A more pertinent question would relate to how this report was put up there in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a shoddy and misleading piece of work.  I ask the Taoiseach to make it clear to the D&aacute;il and the people who are viewing this session that he understands well that those who are living on welfare are not doing so by choice and, more to the point, are not living the high life.  That is simply not the case.  A low income is a low income.  People are struggling as a direct consequence of the Government&rsquo;s bad policy decisions.</P>

	<P>A question, please.  We are over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments that he continues to have full confidence in the ESRI, its independence and its capacity to give thought-provoking and useful information to policy makers.  I would raise a question mark over that.  I think this document was incendiary and misleading.  I also believe it will be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not speak for the ESRI.  I listened to the comments that were made this morning by the author of the report.  I also listened to the comments of the director of the ESRI.  I do not speak for either of them.  I do not see why we cannot have an opportunity to discuss these issues through the Oireachtas committees.  Unemployment and employment are the most pertinent and fundamental issues that are facing this country and its people.  I do not accept the assertion, which the Deputy always blithely throws in, that all of these policies are bad.  I am sure she accepts that 11,000 jobs have been created in the hospitality sector.  I am sure she is pleased that PayPal will create 1,000 jobs in County Louth, which is the constituency of her party leader.  In many areas, this will not be turned around in the next two years.  We are dealing with reality here.  The Deputy seems to be asserting that the Government should not empathise with those who are living frustrated lives and are under serious pressure because of the current economic circumstances.  Does she believe we should not try to understand their needs?  Does she think we should not be asking young people what they would like to do?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has done a lot of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has done a fair bit of it herself.</P>

	<P>It is not getting us anywhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does she want us to stop asking them what kind of upskilling or retraining courses they would like to pursue, so the Government can reflect that through the State agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does she think it is all right to live in an ivory tower?  Is that what she assumes?  I want her to understand that the Government is engaging vigorously with people about their concerns and anxieties.  We are listening and we will act, in so far as we can, in the interests of the nation and the people.  Our job is to rectify the public finances and the legacy we inherited.  The Government must make decisions that provide opportunities for people to work in gainful employment.</P>

	<P>It is no joke for those who are on social protection.  Deputy McDonald can cast aspersions on that in any way she wants.  The important thing is that such people should be given an opportunity to have hope and confidence by means of a demonstration that good Government decisions actually lead to employment.  If people are happy in themselves that they can contribute to their own family circumstances, that will be to the good and the benefit of their localities.  Regardless of whether this document is complete, whether it used correct methodologies or whether it is to be reformed, my understanding is that it is a working document.  I do not see why the Oireachtas committee dealing with this matter cannot talk about these issues.  The important thing is to listen to those who are on social protection as they speak about their circumstances and to point out that assistance is available to get such people out of that rut.  That is what this Government will focus on for the duration of its remit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>As we organise ceremonies to mark the centenary of 1916 and the ensuing War of Independence, the continuing European crisis looms as a forbidding backdrop.  Our debate in this country has always been skewed by &ldquo;follow the money&rdquo; mantras which deflect from what could be a bigger master-plan.  As in the Treaty negotiations, when Lloyd George described negotiating with de Valera as trying to pick up mercury with a fork, the federalisation of Europe debate, one of rational thought, views and opinions, is also like trying to pick up mercury.</P>
        <P>Are we being sleepwalked into a federalised Europe?  If so, what do the Irish sovereign people think of this and is it something we want?  Federalism will downgrade Ireland to a province of Europe and, consequently, downgrade Leinster House to a very nice but, in effect, county council office.  With economic policies being the starting block for building a federal Europe, what are we looking at and are we being played by the Pied Piper of Europe down a road where we may relinquish our sovereignty completely?</P>
        <P>This debate is one that needs to be addressed.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on what many would see as failed plans to federalise Europe and how Ireland may well be set to revert to the dominion status of 1949, this time to Europe rather than to the Commonwealth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Ireland is not going to be walked into any federalisation of Europe.  That was rejected by the people on more than one occasion.  What is required here is to make political decisions, both within the eurozone and at a European level, to deal with the European banking crisis in the first instance and look at where the Union of 500 million people expects to be in the next ten years.  It also means looking at the opportunities that exist through the Single Market, the development of the single patent digital market and for concluding trade agreements outside the European Union, which means so much potential for this country as an exporting nation.  The Deputy&rsquo;s asks if this country going to be walked into a federalised Europe and the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his very clear and definitive answer &ldquo;No&rdquo;, to which I will hold him in the House.  However, the constant debate in recent months has been totally about further integration and further fiscal union.  Chancellor Angela Merkel says we cannot have a solution unless we first get to that full fiscal union.  Will the Taoiseach tell Angela Merkel and Germany that the Irish people are not for a federal Europe and that the Irish people are not going to be walked down this road into giving up our sovereignty completely and following the lead of Germany and France, given the way they are dictating the pace of the Union for the future?  Will the Taoiseach bring that message to Europe and will he tell Europe that the Irish people are not for a full federalised Europe and not for full integration, and that they will retain their sovereignty into the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The European leaders are very well aware of Ireland&rsquo;s position.  Ireland has voted over the years in respect of European Union treaty after European Union treaty and the Irish people have made their decisions on that very clear, no more so than in the recent 60-40 decision in respect of the fiscal stability treaty.  That is what this is about.  It is about consolidating and strengthening the euro within the eurozone.  I answered a question yesterday by saying we support in principle the question of a banking union, which is something that would be in every country&rsquo;s interest in regard to having a streamlined, efficient, working banking system across all countries in the eurozone.  European leaders are well aware of the importance of sovereignty in a country like this and they are well aware of our attitude towards a federal Europe.  Let me repeat it again for the Deputy.  His first question was whether we are being sleepwalked into something like a total federal Europe.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised in the House the issue of the necessity and the importance of having a debate in regard to the situation pertaining to Deputy Mick Wallace, and I understand Deputy Wallace himself wanted to avail of an opportunity to make a statement to the House.  My understanding from the Whips&rsquo; meetings was that the Government Whip indicated there were legal reasons that motions or a debate could not be proceeded with.  I also understood that Standing Orders precluded any such statement by Deputy Wallace.  However, it would seem to me, and I would appreciate some clarification of this, that Standing Order 57 specifically allows for a statement in regard to a matter of this kind, and also a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder why legal issues are being invoked here when Standing Order 57 seems very clear.  Standing Order 57 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Subject always to the right of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to legislate on any matter (and any guidelines which may be drawn up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges from time to time), and unless otherwise precluded under Standing Orders, a member shall not be prevented from raising in the D&aacute;il any matter of general public importance, even where court proceedings have been initiated: Provided that...</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) members may only raise matters in a substantive manner (i.e. by way of Parliamentary Question, matter raised under Standing Order 21, motion, etc.) where due notice is required...</P>
        <P FLI="0">It seems to me there is no barrier to having this issue at least debated and discussed.  I repeat that I consider it extraordinary that every news channel and every station outside of this House can debate the issue and facilitate discussion of it yet this House is the last place that can actually do that.  Irrespective of the merits or demerits of the case and irrespective of one&rsquo;s views on it, it is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Parliament of the nation is not in a position to debate it.</P>
        <P>It seems to me that the Standing Orders allow for it.  I believe we should concentrate our minds in terms of facilitating the said Deputy if he wishes to make a statement &mdash; Standing Orders allow that &mdash; and then to allow a debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy had taken the trouble to telephone me instead of raising it on the floor of the House, I would have explained exactly what I was requested to do.  I have already dealt with this matter.  I received a request that a personal statement be made.  Under Standing Order 44, a personal statement relates to matters that were raised where clarification is needed and where no debate takes place after the statement.  Therefore, the matter is not in accordance with Standing Order 44.</P>
        <P>I did what I did in the interest of the Members of this House and in accordance with Standing Orders and I make no apologies for adhering to Standing Orders.  I suggest the Deputy should get his Whip to come to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the next occasion and suggest an amendment to Standing Orders.  I would be pleased if the committee discussed it, and if the D&aacute;il so decides, we will change the Standing Orders.  There is no point in coming in here and making it look as if I am being questioned as to why I was the bad boy and did not allow a statement.  Therefore, we are not having a debate.

      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>As I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, at approximately this time of year, Women&rsquo;s Aid publishes its annual domestic violence figures.  Over 13,000 people called the organisation&rsquo;s helpline last year.  Some 2,000 of those calls disclosed emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children in their homes and this represented a 25% increase on the previous year.  Some 3,000 callers said that children were witnessing at first hand the abuse and violence perpetrated against their mothers.  The Government has been in office for over 15 months and, as the Taoiseach is aware, he made a commitment on entering Government to introduce reformed, consolidated domestic violence legislation.  Unfortunately, that legislation has been put on the back burner because the Government has prioritised troika-related legislation.  We know that domestic violence increases during times of economic recession, so the urgency of dealing with this matter by introducing legislation also increases.  I am disappointed that the Government has not yet taken the kind of concrete preventative action that is necessary to protect women and their children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot have a debate on the subject.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Taoiseach propose to deliver on the programme for Government commitment?  When can we expect the introduction of the reformed consolidated domestic violence legislation, and when will we get some indication that the Government will fund the services in question to an adequate level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for her query.  Given that this country is in a programme, detailed analysis of its performance is required on a regular basis.  So that we can continue to receive funding, various changes must be made, some of which are very serious and many of which require legislation.  That is why the House will continue to sit as late as necessary before it rises for the summer recess to deal with a raft of legislation which is required under the troika arrangements for the country to function.  That does not in any way detract from the necessity of dealing with other important legislation, including the domestic violence legislation.  I responded to Deputy Adams on this last week.  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to deal with all aspects of domestic violence &mdash; the Deputy mentioned sexual, physical and emotional abuse.  I cannot give a date on which it will be produced, but work is proceeding.  Given the need for consultation and the sensitivity of the issue, as well as the requirement to dispose of other legislation, it has not been possible to publish a Bill before now.</P>
        <P>In advance of those wider reforms, reforms have already been introduced to domestic violence legislation by means of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which, as the Deputy is aware, removed the minimum required period of cohabitation before one member of a cohabiting couple may apply for a safety order &mdash; previously, the applicant was required to have resided with the respondent for at least six of the previous 12 months &mdash; and gave equal access to the protections of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 to same and opposite-sex couples.  The relevant provision previously referred only to couples living together as husband and wife.  The 2011 Act also widened the scope of section 2 of the 1996 Act, which specifies who may apply for a safety order, to enable a person to obtain a safety order against a person with whom he or she has a child in common.  This is the only exception to the general rule that the protections available under the Domestic Violence Act are for the benefit of persons who have lived together in the same household.  The work to which I have referred is proceeding, and changes were made in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Taoiseach cannot give a date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy a date for publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>After all that.  It took ten minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Within four months the Government will introduce those changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>With the window of opportunity for the introduction of legislation between now and the summer recess narrowing, can the Taoiseach tell me whether the Bill pertaining to the creation of SOLAS, earmarked for 2012, will be published before the end of this year?  It is important that we have a good education and training system in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Bannon that the clear intention is to have the legislation introduced and passed by the end of this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill be published?  It is important legislation.</P>

	<P>With regard to the promised health governance Bill, is the Taoiseach aware that there are 68 people waiting for prostheses at the moment at Gurranabraher hospital in Cork, and a total of 595 people, between prostheses and orthotics&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What legislation is the Deputy talking about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>

	<P>On the health governance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to indulge me on one more matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot make statements every morning on legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not making a statement, a Cheann Comhairle.  A child aged three and a half&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should request a Topical Issue debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>A three and a half year old child who had an amputation must wait a year and a half for a prosthesis.  That is not right.  What can be done about it?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we talking about promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of Deputy Healy-Rae, the HSE governance Bill will be published this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The health information Bill is also promised.  Has the Bill been discussed in Cabinet, and have the heads been agreed?  When is it likely to come before the House for Second Stage?</P>
        <P>The DNA Bill, which is also promised, is eagerly awaited by those involved in the pursuit of crime and those given the responsibility of impeding those who have made a life of crime.  Have the heads of that Bill been discussed and agreed?  When is it likely to come before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform Deputy Durkan that the heads of that Bill were cleared in 2009.  It is expected to be published before the end of the year.  The heads of the criminal justice (forensic evidence and DNA database system) Bill were cleared back in 2007, and it will also be published before the end of this year.</P>

	<P>Is there any legislative response that we can make as a House to the situation in Syria?  There is a humanitarian crisis which requires leadership not only by our country, but by the whole world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This has erupted into a full-scale civil war and the atrocities are beyond belief.  As far as the Government is concerned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is in touch with our European colleagues and we join with them and with other leaders of Governments around the world in condemning unreservedly the atrocities taking place in Syria.  Ireland will contribute in whatever way it can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the civil war in the Labour Party that the Taoiseach should be more worried about.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The issue of Syria will be discussed during the Topical Issue Debate this afternoon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it intended to publish the Green Paper on the Defence Forces, and why is the Minister pre-empting its recommendations by announcing a reduction in the number of Army brigades from three to two?  When will the House be informed of the future of the Western Brigade and the status of its headquarters in Custume Barracks in Athlone?  There is great anxiety among Army personnel, their families and the business community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy asking about the Green Paper?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Minister has pre-empted the recommendations of the Green Paper.  I want to know when it will come before the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge, a Cheann Comhairle, that the manner in which you dealt with my request to make a statement was correct.  It was due to my lack of understanding that I did not apply in the right manner.  If I apply under Standing Order 57, will I be facilitated with an opportunity to make a statement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing I can suggest to the Deputy is that, as he is no longer in the Technical Group, he make a request to the Government, which has made it clear that it will await the outcome of the discussion by the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests.  I understand the Whips are discussing the possibility of having statements, but let us wait for the committee to discuss the issue.  It is the Deputy&rsquo;s right to seek time from the Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Standing Orders are there for everybody to read.  I advised Deputy Wallace that he had the right to seek Government time but that a personal explanation under Standing Order 44 was not in order.  If Deputies Martin, Joe Higgins and Wallace want to ask for Government time on the Order of Business to debate an issue, that is their right and I will facilitate them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to comply with what the Ceann Comhairle has just said.  I acknowledge that he referred Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s request to the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests.  If that committee deliberates the matter, it will come back to the D&aacute;il afterwards.  However, if the committee decides that it does not want to address the matter, it is unthinkable that we do not have time this week &mdash; I am asking the Taoiseach to facilitate us &mdash; for statements from all the parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  We will ask the Taoiseach to respond.</P>

	<P>I am glad that peace has broken out again.  It is good to see calm restored to the Chamber.  The Ceann Comhairle requested the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests to consider this today.  Deputy Pringle is Chairman of that committee and I expect it will reach a decision quickly.  The Government will respond to its decision.  I have seen instances of this in the past and it is not for me make a comment that might be prejudicial to any consequent proceedings.  I assure Deputy Higgins that the Government will make its decision clear following the committee&rsquo;s deliberations, which I understand will meet shortly.  The Whips will meet after that and the Government will respond.</P>

The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated clearly in his opening statement on Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 on 6 June that it was the Government&rsquo;s intention to move amendments on Committee Stage to add the Treaty of Accession of Croatia and the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon to the measures to be included by the Bill in the domestic law of the State.  Standing Orders require the House to give the necessary instruction before the Select Committee on European Union Affairs is able to consider these amendments.  That is the purpose of the motion.</P>
        <P>In amending the European Communities Act of 1972, the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides a means of incorporating a number of developments at European Union level into the domestic law of the State.  The first element is a protocol amending the protocol on transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.  The purpose of this protocol is to raise on a temporary basis the number of Members of the European Parliament during the current Parliament&rsquo;s term of 2009-14.  This reflects the increased number of MEPs to which 12 member states are entitled under the Treaty of Lisbon in a Parliament elected before that treaty entered into force.</P>
        <P>The second element is the European Council decision amending article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for member states whose currency is the euro.  This will provide a legal underpinning to the European Stability Mechanism, which is to enter into force next month.  It is for that reason that the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 was published on 8 May in tandem with the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.  The Government wanted to ensure that the people had the full picture available to them, including this Bill, when they came to vote in the referendum on the stability treaty on 31 May.  At the time of publication of the Bill on 8 May, the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon had not yet been signed.  This was done in Brussels on 16 May.  When EU leaders agreed the terms of the protocol at the European Council meeting of 18 and 19 June 2009 they also agreed that at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty the provisions of the decision on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon would be set out in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties.  The protocol is thus linked in time to the Croatian accession treaty.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to bring forward amendments to include the Irish legal guarantees protocol and the Croatian accession treaty in the current Bill so as to include both in the definition of the treaties governing the EU as set out in the European Communities Act.  The effect of the proposed amendments will be to provide in the domestic law of the State for the accession of Croatia as the 28th member of the European Union, which the Government warmly welcomes, and for the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon.  The latter is also warmly welcomed as a clear reflection of the EU delivering on its promise to the Irish people.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>The timing of this legislation is cruel in some respects given that it deals with Croatia after our loss to them on Sunday.  Notwithstanding that, it is positive that the process has reached its final stages and we are now in a position to welcome Croatia into the family of European states.  Perhaps we can look to Spain to bail us out on the football field before the end of the week.</P>
        <P>The forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is scheduled for 1 July 2013, is the culmination of a long process of European integration for that country but it also marks a seminal moment for the long embattled Balkans.  Looking at the volatility in the region and the current problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the EU must play a positive part in that area.  The EU should act as a role model and, ultimately, a goal for these countries.  A cursory glance at history shows the importance of the region globally.  The shots in Sarajevo sparked the start of the First World War and reshaped the whole world.  The scars of the civil wars of the 90s that accompanied the collapse of Yugoslavia carry a strong moral imperative to show leadership in the area and avoid the horrifying violence of Srebrenica that, 50 years after the Second World War, shows the great threat of violence has not left the Continent.  The EU has a moral, political and strategic onus to take up the burden of leadership in the region.  I hope the current travails of the Union do not distract from that work or discourage the countries that aspire to the values of the Union and are working towards EU membership.  Croatia should act as an incentive to, and a flagship of, EU membership in the region.</P>
        <P>In these difficult days for the EU, when the thread of solidarity for the Union wears thin for many member states, it is reinvigorating to be reminded of what sustains the Union.  The reasons Croatia underwent the arduous task of adhering to the ever more complex <i>acquis</i> of the EU were manifold.  It allows Croatia to access the open markets of the world&rsquo;s largest economic area of over 500 million people and it enables the free movement of capital across the Continent.  It allows her people to travel unhindered across 27 other member states, to open up EU universities to Croat students, and to affirm the democratic principles and respect for human rights and dignity that underpins the philosophy of the Union.</P>
        <P>In going through the economic crisis that has bedevilled the Union and, more particularly, the euro area over the past three years, much has been lost of the vision of the founding fathers of the European project.  It has become a narrow focus on economics, fiscal difficulties and banking issues, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the euro project was carved from a desire to see peace across the Continent and how we could develop and build on it.  We should not be blinded by the crisis, which will be a small footnote in the history of Europe.</P>
        <P>In moments of doubt about the future of the Union it is worth reminding ourselves of the progress the Union has spurred on, facilitated and encouraged across the Continent, in Ireland and now hopefully in Croatia.  Croatia emphatically voted in favour of accession to the EU in January, a sign of enthusiasm for the EU that should stir us on towards tackling the problems of the Union.  A country that first emerged as a war-torn land riven by sectarian violence has moved on from its bloody past to embrace a brighter future founded on the pan-European values of democracy, competition and the rule of law.  This should serve to remind us all of the potential of the EU and serve as a beacon of hope for the region.  Issues about accession remain, namely, whether Croatian nationals should have immediate access to our labour markets.  Outstanding issues in Croatia remain to be resolved.  However, those important issues aside, we can welcome Croatia into the fold of the EU as an equal partner in the future of Europe.</P>
        <P>I understand the second amendment to the Bill, which the Government will move on Committee Stage, will provide for the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Lisbon treaty, which was signed in Brussels on 16 May to form part of the domestic law of the State.  The signing of the protocol addresses the concerns of the Irish people on the Lisbon treaty with regard to the right to life, family and education, taxation, and security and defence.  The European Council stated the sole purpose of the protocol is to give full treaty status to the clarifications set out in the decision.</P>
        <P>I understand the protocol will clarify but not change the content or the application of the Lisbon treaty.  This a welcome measure to finalise the Lisbon treaty and copperfasten the assurances the Government received on areas of particular sensitivity to the Irish people.  I welcome the amendments to the Bill as progressive steps for Ireland and the Union.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in is not happy that four diverse issues have been lumped together in this Bill.  However, we agree with each of the proposals and will accept them.  It is ironic they have been lumped together, even though it was not planned like this.  One proposal is to provide for a permanent emergency funding mechanism and reflects the failure of European monetary union, the failure of solidarity, the failure of the structure to deal with the crisis, the failure of those in the banking sector to take responsibility for the crisis they created and the failure to restructure the banking and financial sector.  As we speak, the Spanish Government and the Spanish people will be given money to bail out their banks without any rigorous stress testing of the banking sector.  The same mistakes have been repeated and they do not meet their responsibilities.  It is ironic that we have that provision in the amendment as well as the accession of Croatia.</P>
        <P>Good luck to Croatia, which is very welcome.  It has been a long journey for its people to get to this point.  What kind of European Union is Croatia entering and what kind of solidarity can it expect when a potential crisis emerges?  The Irish people were saddled with banking debt that will have an impact on generations, with no answer to our difficulties.  If that experience is anything to go by, this is a difficult time for Croatia to enter the Union.</P>
        <P>On a hopeful note, we need to go back to basics.  The European Union project has many positive elements, such as the binding together of peoples who were in an awful conflict.  Croatia is part of the Balkans and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo gave birth to the dreadful First World War and, because lessons were not learned from mistakes, the devastation of the dreadful Second World War followed.  The hopeful project of the European Union followed and included social Europe, women&rsquo;s rights, environmental legislation, equality and human rights.  All of these have been achieved and there has been solidarity at times.  The project has potential to be a great, hopeful project but this is not a good time for it.  With the exception of Croatia, it might remind us to go back to what the project was supposed to be about.  With that positive development next year, it might focus our minds on what we need to do in Europe and what solidarity means.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak and we will support the four items in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a shoddy attempt to muddy the waters on the European stability mechanism.  It is part of a systematic campaign by this Government to prevent serious discussion on the European Stability Mechanism, its contents and its far-reaching consequences for the citizens of this country in terms of further austerity when we enter a second so-called bailout programme.  Given the austerity provisions we will be required to commit to if we enter the European Stability Mechanism, it should more accurately be described as a burial programme for the Irish economy and society.</P>
        <P>No one has any objection to the accession of Croatia to the European Union.  We welcome it.  Similarly, inserting some protocol into the Lisbon treaty, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty on European Union noting the concerns raised by the public about the Lisbon treaty are welcome provisions.  However, I note that the concerns the Government chose to identify as what the public was concerned about in respect of the Lisbon treaty are not exhaustive or reflective of the actual concerns raised by those of us who opposed it on the first and second occasions.  This protocol identifies issues to do with the right to life, with taxation &mdash; the Government is primarily concerned with the issue of corporate tax &mdash; with the important issue of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the common foreign and security policy of the European Union and in particular, Ireland being slowly dragged into a European army and a European military apparatus, the militarisation of Europe and the connection to the NATO military alliance.  However, this protocol merely notes our concern in this regard and it does nothing to prevent us being slowly dragged into that NATO military alliance, as, of course, is testified to by the fact that Irish soldiers are present in the NATO operation in Afghanistan.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Of course, other concerns were raised by the public at the time, one of which is particularly worthy of mention, given the current financial crisis in Europe.  The first people to raise the narrow mandate of the European Central Bank being copper-fastened &mdash; only concerning itself with inflation and not concerning itself with issues to do with employment and macro-economic stability &mdash; were those of us from the left who opposed the Lisbon treaty, who said this was a recipe for disaster, that the mandate of the ECB was too narrow.  Since then, other people are jumping up and down saying they want the mandate of the ECB to be broadened but, of course, at the time, when we raised the issue of the narrow mandate of the ECB, we were dismissed, ignored and vilified as being scar-mongers.  Of course, we have been proven to be right.  At the time of the Lisbon treaty, we also raised issues to do with the commitment of European treaties &mdash; strengthened in the Lisbon treaty &mdash; to foster and promote the privatisation of public services, to effectively make illegal the provision of State aid for public enterprises, all of which are extremely damaging provisions which undermine the ability of this State and other European states to protect themselves against the consequences of economic crisis and they undermine us in our efforts to find a way out of that economic crisis.  None of those expressed concerns is acknowledged in this protocol.  Most of all, I object very strongly to the mixing up of these issues of the accession of Croatia and the concerns of the Irish public over the Lisbon treaty with the European Stability Mechanism.  It is part of an attempt to cover up what is involved in the European Stability Mechanism.  This should be dealt with separately and there should be proper debate.  A guillotine should not have been imposed.</P>
        <P>It is disgraceful that the media have refused to engage in any serious way in a discussion of the contents of the European Stability Mechanism, which may cost this State up &euro;11 billion or more to help recapitalise and bail out European banks or even more than &euro;11 billion, as is becoming apparent with the growing crisis in Spain and in Italy.  The ESM staff and governors and its assets and property will not be subject to any legal scrutiny or any political or public oversight.  It is outrageous.  The ESM will be based on strict conditionality, that is, austerity being imposed on the Irish people for the privilege of bailing out European banks.  I strongly oppose these amendments being included in a Bill that is essentially about facilitating the European Stability Mechanism which is nothing more than another vehicle to deliver poisonous austerity onto the heads of the Irish people and other European citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30th June, 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The House will be aware of the background to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  It was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing in August 1998 in which 29 people were murdered in an indiscriminate bomb attack.</P>
        <P>The Act contains a series of amendments to the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1985 to make them more responsive to the threat from certain groups.  Principally, these amendments concern changes in the rules of evidence for certain offences under the Acts, including the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances; the creation of new offences, such as directing an unlawful organisation, possession of certain articles and collecting information; and extending the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the 1939 Act to 72 hours.</P>
        <P>Section 18 of the 1998 Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force.  By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2011, these sections were continued in force until 30 June 2012.</P>
        <P>Prior to moving any motion for renewal, the Act requires me to lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions.  The present report covers the period from 1 June 2011, the end date of the previous report, to 31 May this year.  The report was laid before the House on 8 June 2012.   It also includes, following a commitment I gave when seeking renewal of the sections this time last year, a table showing the figures for each of the years since the Act came into operation.  This is helpful in showing the importance of the Act in equipping the Garda to detect and prevent terrorist actions.</P>
        <P>It is my fervent wish that the time will come when these provisions will no longer be required.  However, as Minister for Justice and Equality I must have regard to the reality of the situation.  The Garda assessment, shared by the PSNI, in regard to the terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland is that it is severe, which demonstrates the need for the continuance of these provisions.  If Deputies needed reminding, this need is clearly and tragically evidenced by the murder of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr on 2 April 2011, the numerous other attacks on PSNI and security personnel and attempted bombings in recent months.  These attacks included the attempted murder of a soldier on 5 January 2012, a pipe bomb recovered at the scene of a fire in West Belfast on 17 January 2012, two pipe bombs set off in Londonderry on 19 January 2012, a viable device placed under the car of the elderly parents of a PSNI officer on the 15 April 2012 &mdash; the second such attack on these individuals, a van with 262 kg of home made explosives, with the potential for remote detonation, discovered near the Border at a location used as a regular turnaround point for PSNI vehicles on 26 April 2012 and an explosive device &mdash; found under a parked car &mdash; and a cache of weapons found in north Belfast on the 27 April 2012.  On Saturday last, 9 June, a quantity of explosives was found during a search in County Mayo.</P>
        <P>North-South co-operation in the area of security is vital.  I can assure the House that it has never been better.  I keep in close contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Owen Paterson and with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford.  I know that the Commissioner maintains close and frequent contact with Chief Constable Baggott.  This is mirrored by contacts between the two Forces at every level.</P>
        <P>While countering the threat posed by dissident groups is very important, it is necessary not to lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  The 1998 Act grew out of our own domestic troubles.  However, its provisions form an essential element of the State&rsquo;s response to the threat of terrorism from any source.  We cannot ignore the growth in recent years of the international terrorist threat.  In co-operation with our EU partners, we must continue to counteract any threat from such sources.  The 1998 Act forms part of the response to that threat.</P>
        <P>It is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Act continues to be a most important tool in its ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  The Garda authorities have stated that the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report which I have laid before the House.  Furthermore, given the considerable threat posed by some dissident groups, it is essential that the Act&rsquo;s provisions should continue in force to support the ongoing investigation and disruption of terrorist activity.</P>
        <P>I would like now to turn to the provisions of the 1998 Act, which are the subject of the resolution.  As I mentioned, I have laid before the House a report on the operation of the relevant sections between 1 June 2011 and 31 May this year.  The report demonstrates the value of the relevant sections to the Garda&iacute; and the necessity for their continued availability in tackling the terrorist threat.</P>
        <P>Section 2 allows a court, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, to draw appropriate inferences where an accused person fails to answer or gives false or misleading answers to questions.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on the basis of such an inference.  There must be some other evidence which points towards a person&rsquo;s guilt.  This provision was used on 47 occasions in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 3 requires an accused, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, to give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf. This provision was used on four occasions.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides that evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation can be inferred from certain conduct, including matters such as movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused.  This provision was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 6 creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939. This provision was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 7 makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that they are in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.  This provision was used on 15 occasions.</P>
        <P>Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  This provision was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 9 makes it an offence to withhold certain information which might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person for such an offence.  This provision was used on 83 occasions.</P>
        <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court following an application by a Garda of at least superintendent rank.  Furthermore, the person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf.  An extension was granted in 11 cases.</P>
        <P>Section 11 allows a judge of the District Court to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, but released without charge.  This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised where the judge is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda about that person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the offence.  This provision was used on 17 occasions.</P>
        <P>Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  This provision was not used in the period covered by the report.</P>
        <P>Section 14 is, in effect, a procedural section which makes the offences created under sections 6 to 9 and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  This means that persons suspected of committing these offences may be arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  This provision was used on 98 occasions during the period under report.</P>
        <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property.  Where a person is convicted of offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, the court is required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.  This provision was used on three occasions during the period covered by the report.  Deputies will note by reference to the table that this is the first reporting period that has recorded a usage of this most valuable provision.  I very much welcome this development.</P>
        <P>As I have already stated, dissident groups unfortunately remain a threat to the existence of this State.  They are opposed to the benefits that have flowed from the peace process and are determined to undermine it.  The State must retain in its laws the capacity to defeat them and defend itself.  On the basis of the information set out in the report and on the advice of the Garda authorities, I consider that the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act should remain in operation for a further 12 months.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all agreed that one of the challenges of this sustained period of peace on our island is complacency.  We cannot assume that it will always be this way.  For this reason, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting renewal of this legislation.  The Minister outlined seven incidents, all of which were serious and had the capacity to maim, damage or, in some instances, result in mass murder.  I presume the incidents outlined are only a selection of those which have taken place during the past 12 months.  The potential to cause huge damage to human rights and the identity of this country remains a threat.  As recently as last week, there were further incidents.</P>
        <P>There have been cuts to the budgets of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Police Service of Northern Ireland.  It is hoped there will be a continued ringfencing of the budget in this area and that the maximum possible resources, along with the co-operation referred to by the Minister, are being invested to ensure these laws are implemented.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the continuance of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed this issue last year in the context of the requirement on the Minister to bring before the House every 12 months a resolution for continuance of certain sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, at which time Sinn F&eacute;in put on record its opposition to the provisions contained within that Act and the then proposed resolution.</P>
        <P>In outlining his reasons for continuance of these provisions, the Minister referred to dissident activity.  Sinn F&eacute;in has clearly stated that those groups involved in that type of activity should cease that activity.  They need to join the peace process.  It is incumbent on all of us to encourage these groups to embrace the democratic process.  The Minister has referred in the past to upholding and implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement because it is the democratic wish of the Irish people.  There is an onus on us to do so and as part of this there is a responsibility to bring about as quickly as possible the normalisation of policing and justice on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is no argument for the retention of these Acts.  This is draconian legislation and we have said so in the past.  This is not only our view.  It might be a lonely view in the Chamber, but outside it various human rights organisations have criticised the provisions the Minister proposes to renew.  According to the Minister&rsquo;s report only ten convictions have been secured in the courts despite the fact that 610 people have been arrested under these provisions.  According to the table provided by the Minister, four sections have not been used for many years and one section has not been used for ten years.  This is an indication the provisions have more to do with information gathering, but this is not the purpose for which they were originally brought before the House.  We need to review and repeal them and I urge Deputies to vote against the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I opposed the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 when it came before the D&aacute;il and I also oppose the renewal of the various sections today.  The Act was introduced after the unspeakable atrocity that was the Omagh bombing.  At the time I pointed out the united response of rage and revulsion of ordinary people on the island as a whole and beyond the island, but in particular of the ordinary people, Protestant and Catholic, in Northern Ireland, did more to isolate the crazed organisations which seek to sow sectarian division than any raft of repressive legislation.</P>
        <P>The Socialist Party and its antecedents over a 40 year period have a proud record of championing the unity of working-class people in Northern Ireland and active opposition to sectarian division, sectarianism and sectarian organisations.  It also opposed the oppression coming from the British establishment and the tactics and methods of the paramilitary organisations, whether loyalist or republican, pointing out they would not bring forward the interests of the ordinary working class people of the North or find a resolution to the situation in the North and the national question.  We have been vindicated with regard to these issues.</P>
        <P>I am opposed to giving the State major repressive powers which can be used in any direction should the State require it at a particular time.  I refer in particular to the renewal of section 6 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which provides, &ldquo;A person who directs, at any level of the organisation&rsquo;s structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under section 19 of the Act of 1939 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This brings us to sections 18 and 19 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  Section 19 states if and whenever the Government is of the opinion that any particular organisation is an unlawful organisation it shall be lawful for the Government in the public interest to declare that such organisation be suppressed.  This relates to organisations outlined in section 18 of the 1939 Act.  According to section 18, &ldquo;In order to regulate and control in the public interest the exercise of the constitutional right of citizens to form associations, it is hereby declared that any organisation which [under section 18(<i>f</i>)] &lsquo;promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the Central Fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation shall be an unlawful organisation within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Are you worried you will be suppressed for not paying the household charge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, this gives the State the power to suppress an organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Socialist Party members who do not pay the household charge.  They could be suppressed under this provision.  Is this the Deputy&rsquo;s case?  Is this what is known as an invitation to treat?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We will come to this in a moment but before we do so let us take as an example a group of citizens with serious difficulties with how motor taxation is levied who form a group and as part of a civil disobedience protest and a demand for change advocate the withholding of motor tax for a period.  This could be criminalised under the Offences Against the State Act and the progression I have gone through could be implemented.  It gives dictatorial powers to the Government.  Since the Minister referred to it, 50% of the households in the State are engaged in a major boycott of the household tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is called tax dodging.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister would not refer to billionaire tax exiles who own most of the media in the country in the same terms, or perhaps the Minister does.  Does he?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not want to talk about them in case they do not use their newspapers to support him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 50% of the households in the State are engaged in a major boycott of the household tax.  This is a major active campaign of opposition to austerity and the injustice of their being called upon to bail out billionaire bankers and bondholders throughout Europe and the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Was Deputy Wallace engaged in a campaign against austerity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The campaign involves mass assemblies and rallies, political lobbying, major protest marches and organised opposition to effect a change in Government policies.  The Minister and the Government would have the power to declare such an organisation could be repressed and those organising the anti-household tax organisation could be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.</P>
        <P>To go back further in history prior to 1939, the campaign of justice by small farmers against land annuities and repayment of the old landlord class to reward them for their crimes or what they did could be suppressed and those leading it could be subject to life imprisonment under this legislation.  It is monstrous.  It is oppressive and we oppose it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Higgins has already said, we all welcomed the enormous movement by people in the North &mdash; Catholic, Protestant and those of no religion &mdash; who in response to some of the most horrendous atrocities in the conflict there demanded an end to the sectarian violence that had blighted the Northern state for so long.  It was that pressure of people power uniting against sectarian atrocities that brought about an end to the worst aspects of the conflict in the North.  While it was not, sadly, an end to all the conflict, at least it created an atmosphere in which the main participants in that conflict stood down and peace agreements followed.  We all welcomed that and we all abhor the attempt by small numbers of people to return to or continue down the cul-de-sac of sectarian violence that blighted the North.</P>
        <P>While it is right and justified to condemn and criticise in the strongest terms groups that wish to continue down that failed and disastrous road, it is also worth pointing out &mdash; as we did at the time &mdash; that the structures that were established as a result of the peace agreement institutionalised politics along sectarian lines, not dissimilar to what has happened in places such as Lebanon and elsewhere and has at least helped to continue to fester sectarian sentiment rather than overcome it by having, for example, quota systems when it comes to voting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a solution to the Lebanon problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has had his chance and he will have it again.  It helps to move away from sectarian quotas which are included in the Northern Ireland peace agreement.  However, repressive legislation such as this is not the way to continue the momentum for peace and for breaking down sectarianism.  In many cases this legislation is used to target the wrong people.  I will not elaborate on Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s comments in this regard except to say that under the provisions of this legislation Mahatma Gandhi, if he were in this country, could be imprisoned for life for his campaign not to pay tax on the production of salt.  Under such a campaign of civil disobedience he would be liable to be put in prison for life and proscribed as the organiser of an unlawful campaign of civil disobedience.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Brien pointed out that given the low number of convictions under this legislation in contrast with the large number of arrests and other uses of the legislation, it would appear it is being used more to gather information on organisations and groups with which the State has a problem.  When this extends to anti-war activists it begins to be of serious concern.  The Garda recently raided the home of the PRO of the Galway Alliance against War.  His house was raided at 8 a.m. with his wife and daughters in bed.  Vile language was used against members of the family and one of his daughters was vilified for being a member of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The garda&iacute; claimed to be there because of an investigation over a protest that had taken place in Shannon Airport against the use of that airport by the US military.  They did not find the information they sought, but they seized three computers, two DVDs of peace protests in 2005 and 2006, and various papers.  They also complained that Mr. Farrell, the PRO of the Galway Alliance against War, had too many books on his shelves before they headed off with computers, including a computer belonging to his wife which contained sensitive academic and examination material belonging to students in the university in which she lectures.  They have still not returned those computers which do not contain any incriminating information on the activities of a peace organisation, but contain the databases containing contact details for the membership of the Galway Alliance against War.</P>
        <P>Was that raid carried out under the provisions of this legislation?  What does the Minister have to say about the use of such powers to raid in the early morning the house of an anti-war activist?  Will he return those computers and ensure this legislation is not abused in this way?  Will he ensure that legislation that would allow that to happen is not on the Statute Book?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Calleary for his considered response to and support for the motion.  There remains a substantial threat from terrorist activity and particularly from so-called dissident republican paramilitary groups which warrants the continuing in force of the Act&rsquo;s provisions.  This House needs to send out the clear message that the State will not bow to the self-serving interests of terrorists who continue to see themselves as being entitled to destroy a peace process that is working and has made the lives of so many people on this island so much better.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the provision of resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I repeat what I have said on many occasions in the past.  The Garda will continue to take whatever action is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks and bring those engaged in terrorist activities to justice before the courts.  It will continue to co-operate fully with the PSNI in its work.  It is appropriate to congratulate the Garda and PSNI on the work they have done in the past 12 months in preventing some atrocities that would have occurred without the very good work undertaken by both policing organisations on this island, which work so well in co-operation with each other.</P>
        <P>I listened with some interest to what Deputy O&rsquo;Brien had to say with regard to human rights and with some bemusement to what Deputies Higgins and Boyd Barrett had to say.  They appear more concerned with the rights of those intent on destroying the peace process and committed to continued violence and atrocities than the rights of ordinary individuals who want to go about their lives on the island.  The greatest right is the right to live in peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister has just said is utterly dishonest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the right not to be maimed or injured, the right not to discover a bomb under one&rsquo;s car, the right not to be shot as one walks down the street, and the right of a member of the PSNI, who happens to be a member of the Roman Catholic community, not to be targeted and shot by republicans who resent that the PSNI is now a force that substantially represents the different religious groupings in Northern Ireland.  That is the ultimate right &mdash; the right to live in peace.  The State has a right and obligation to protect the wider community on this island.  We have a particular obligation regarding the Republic of Ireland and we have an obligation with regard to all those who live in Northern Ireland to do everything we can to contribute to maintaining peace on the island.  These provisions are crucial in that regard and I make no apology for their continuation.  The number of occasions on which they have been utilised clearly indicates they perform a very serious function in this area.</P>
        <P>I listened to Deputy Higgins speak about how he opposed these provisions originally and he religiously opposes them.  He then made reference to the atrocity of the Omagh bombing and pointed out that in his view the united rage and revulsion that resulted from the Omagh bombing was all that was needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite rage and revulsion it took 30 years to end the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The conflict in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It was ended by the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s illusion that it ended because people rose up against violence, it ended because it took those engaged in violence 30 years to discover that violence was not getting them anywhere and they grew weary of it.  Ultimately, political arrangements were put in place under the Good Friday Agreement which provided mechanisms to bring the violence to an end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is no credit to the people.  It is never the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly and tragically, it was not the demonstrations that took place in the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s that ended the violence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They sent a message to the paramilitaries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality was that many of the people perpetrating violence were slow learners and were impervious to demonstrations.  If the Deputies are naive enough to think that expressing revulsion will stop the groups currently committed to terrorism on this island or that it is something they have any regard or consideration for, they are living in cloud cuckoo land.  The reality is that there is a group of violent people committed to destroying the peace process and to creating as much chaos as they can on this island and all the revulsion in the world will not do any good.  Democracies must have legislation in place to protect the essence of democracy.  This legislation is necessary to ensure the law enforcement agencies on this island can take whatever action is necessary to ensure that those engaged in these activities can be fully and properly investigated and brought to justice.</P>
        <P>My final point is brief.  Either Deputies Boyd Barrett and Higgins are of the view that they are part of democracy and of the democratic system, respect Parliament and recognise that Parliament passes laws and those laws should be complied with or they are simply permanent street protestors.  One cannot take an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> view to the law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (No. 32 of 2009) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30th June, 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This resolution will provide for the continuation in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for a period of 12 months from 30 June 2012.  Let me briefly remind the House of the background to the 2009 Act, lest anyone believe it was an overreaction to a non-existent threat.  At the time there had been an increase in the level of organised crime.  Organised gangs had shown a particular ruthlessness in their activities, including attacks on witnesses and intimidation of jurors.  As a result the Garda was encountering difficulties in persuading people to give assistance in their investigations.  The complete disregard which these gangs showed for human lives threatened to subvert the entire justice system.  In the circumstances, it was imperative that the State take the necessary steps to ensure the criminal justice system was sufficiently robust to withstand the assault launched upon it through intimidation of and violence towards witnesses and jurors.  The measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 were designed to tilt the balance firmly in favour of the rule of law and justice and to instil confidence in all that criminal gangs were not going to be permitted to frustrate criminal investigations or prosecutions of their activities.</P>
        <P>In view of the very real threat these gangs posed, the Act provided for a limited number of specific &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo; offences to be prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court.  The proposal to use the Special Criminal Court for a limited number of organised crime offences removed the possibility of jury tampering or intimidation of jurors.</P>
        <P>The purpose of section 8, therefore, is to ensure that organised criminal gangs cannot interfere with the criminal process to determine the outcome of cases.  To this end the section declares that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, in respect of certain offences.  The offences in question are the organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  In brief, these offences are directing the activities of a criminal organisation, referring to section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006; participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation, referring to section 72; committing a serious offence for a criminal organisation, referring to section 73; and, liability for offences committed by a body corporate, as in section 76.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 makes these scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  Although this means the Special Criminal Court will hear prosecutions for the offences in question, the Director of Public Prosecutions may still exercise his power to direct that the offences should be tried in the ordinary courts.  I believe that permitting the DPP this discretion maintains the fundamental balance in deciding which cases are appropriate to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  A further bulwark in maintaining this balance is provided in section 8(4) of the 2009 Act.  This provides that the section shall cease to be in operation unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that it should continue in operation for a further period, to be decided by the Oireachtas.  I reiterate, that is the purpose of moving today&rsquo;s resolution.</P>
        <P>In order to enable the House to decide on the continuation of section 8, subsection 6 provides that before a resolution to continue section 8 in operation is passed, the Minister for Justice and Equality shall prepare a report, which shall be laid before both Houses, on the operation of the section in the period under report.  The report, covering the period from 1 June 2011 to 31 May 2012 was laid before both Houses on 8 June 2012.</P>
        <P>My reasons for seeking the renewal of section 8 are clear.  Organised crime continues to present a significant law enforcement issue, with a number of criminal gangs continuing to engage in serious crimes.  Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence showing the willingness of the these gangs to engage in murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, counterfeiting and other serious offences.  Given the nature of organised crime, the investigation and prosecution process can be lengthy and difficult.  This is particularly so given the insidious power that criminal gangs hold over their members and, regrettably, within the communities in which they live.  The 2009 Act has been in operation for more than three years and while there have been arrests under the relevant sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 no cases have yet come before the Special Criminal Court in accordance with section 8.  This does not, however, invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use in appropriate circumstances.  The use of the Act to date serves to highlight the considered approach of the Director of Public Prosecutions and vindicates the way in which the provision is constructed, allowing him to exercise his discretion to direct that cases be tried in the ordinary courts.</P>
        <P>In his report to me on the operation of section 8, the Garda Commissioner is of the clear view that this provision is likely to be required for some time to come.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I must have the utmost regard for the views of the Garda authorities in matters such as this.  It is absolutely essential to ensure that garda&iacute; have at their disposal the best possible range of powers to face up to organised criminal gangs.  In that context, and in keeping with an undertaking I gave last year when this matter was being considered, I have asked my officials, in co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to examine ways in which the legislation might be improved.</P>
        <P>In the period under report, there have been a total of 38 arrests under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Three arrests were made under section 71A, namely, directing the activities of a criminal organisation; the remaining 35 were made under section 72, namely, participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation.  As a result of these arrests, a total of 19 other charges have been preferred against various individuals, including 18 relating to burglary and one relating to robbery contrary to sections 12 and 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 respectively.  Only last Monday, 11 June, two men from Galway were each sentenced to nine years&rsquo; imprisonment after they pleaded guilty to offences under section 72.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities devote considerable resources from across the Garda organisation to their efforts to tackle organised crime and they deserve our praise for the successes they have had against a number of those involved in these criminal gangs, who are now behind bars.  Furthermore, the Commissioner has made it clear, time and again, there will be no let-up in the action taken against these gangs.  He has the Government&rsquo;s full support &mdash; and I expect that of Members of this House &mdash; in that approach.</P>
        <P>Let me be blunt &mdash; the individuals involved in organised crime are ruthless people who will stop at nothing to avoid being brought to account for their crimes.  Violence and intimidation are a way of life for these people.  We, that is the Government and the Oireachtas, have a duty to ensure the criminal justice system is equipped to prevent them undermining our core values.  To that end, we must ensure that in the most serious of cases, where jury intimidation is a real possibility, the law has a means available to bring serious criminals to account and to justice.  On balance, I consider it is necessary to continue section 8 in operation for a further period.  The period now proposed will run for 12 months, from 30 June 2012.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House and hope it will have the full support of Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My party will support this motion.  I wish to pay tribute to the Garda for its work in this area during the past 12 months.  Anybody who read about the case in Galway last Monday, to which the Minister referred, will look at the detail and the work that had to go into the prosecution of that case on the part of garda&iacute;.  Although some of the provisions of the Act overall enabled the prosecution it was also the man, or person, hours that went into it which contributed.</P>
        <P>The one difficulty or challenge we have in this regard is that we need to ensure that EU legislation in this general area is as robust as our own internal legislation.  The Minister committed previously to making this one of the key points of his agenda for the Presidency next year.  Perhaps in his wrapping up he might give the House an idea of where we stand on that.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with people who have no regard for this House, the citizens of this country or the rights of anybody.  People who perform their duty and give jury service are doing the State a service and to think that because they do that they may be subject to threats by people who wish to avoid justice is fundamentally wrong.  We need to ensure they have protection and that those who are selected for jury duty in a case such as this will have that protection.  That is why we support the renewal of these measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I comment on the motion, I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s closing remarks on the previous motion which show a complete lack of understanding and ignorance of the situation that prevailed in the North during the past 30 years.  Some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments in regard to &ldquo;slow learners&rdquo; and people only embracing the peace process because they were tired of violence are way off the mark.  He knows this himself.  Those types of comments do not do any justice to those individuals and organisations that took brave and courageous decisions to show leadership in trying to bring about a situation on the island of Ireland where conflict can be resolved through solely democratic and peaceful means.  Even by referring to Derry as Londonderry in his speech, the Minister shows the type of mindset he has, as an individual.  It is very disappointing.  I have never clashed with the Minister on any issues in this House but that closing rant was not fitting for a Minister for Justice and Equality, especially when I consider that the Minister in question has responsibility, under the terms of strand three of the Good Friday Agreement, to bring about the full implementation of that Agreement.</P>
        <P>One of the outstanding issues is the normalisation of policing and justice systems on the island of Ireland.  I have stated in this House that we must all work together to ensure that those groups which are still engaged in a certain type of activity will be convinced their actions will not not achieve the goals they think they will achieve and that the only way forward on this island is through peaceful and democratic methods.  We will work continually to encourage those groups to embrace that belief.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s closing remarks on that point were completely overboard and I believed I should say as much to him.</P>
        <P>On the motion before the House, some of those who are involved in organised criminal activity have absolutely no regard for law and order or the rights of citizens.  Everything must be done to ensure people are given due process when they are brought before the courts.  Everyone has the right to be tried by a jury of their peers.  We have a responsibility to ensure those who serve on juries can do so in a safe manner, free from intimidation.  We will support measures that will allow that.  The budget for witness protection, for instance, was decreased a number of years ago.  We welcomed the increase of 33% in the witness protection budget in this year&rsquo;s budget.  Such measures will ensure we can bring people to court for a fair trial where they can be judged by a jury of their peers.  Such measures will prove more effective in the long run than the repressive measures &mdash; there is no other way of describing them &mdash; contained in the proposal before the House.</P>
        <P>It is a sad reflection on any government or state when it has to admit that the ordinary courts are not adequate to deal with individuals who are involved in organised criminal activity.  In such circumstances, the state in question has failed to deal with issues like jury intimidation and witness protection.  If we are serious about dealing with organised criminal gangs, we need to put resources in place.  For instance, we should not be closing rural Garda stations.  The Minister will say that is just one aspect of the matter.  If we are to be serious, we should ensure financial resources are invested in front-line manpower.  If the recruitment embargo has to be lifted to deal with organised criminal gangs, that should be done.  I am sure those who are involved in organised criminal activity see the introduction of legislation to ensure they are tried before the Special Criminal Court as an admission of the State&rsquo;s failure to provide protections and safeguards to those who serve on juries.  It is the wrong way to go.  We will oppose this proposal for that reason.  That is not flippantly to disregard the activities of these criminal gangs.  We understand they cause misery and hardship and have no regard for law and order.  If we examine best international practice, we will see that other countries have found more effective ways of dealing with organised criminal gangs that do not involve institutions like the Special Criminal Court.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this motion, which relates to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  This hugely important motion gives us a chance to set out our clear and objective views on the current situation, from a human rights view and in the context of the safety of the citizens of this State.  The lives and safety of our people have to be priorities.  This does not mean we do not have to be vigilant and careful in case potential cases of miscarriage of justice arise.  As an Independent Deputy, my role is to ensure the State has a quality justice system that provides safeguards for its citizens.  I welcome this legislation because the issue of organised crime is an exceptional one.  It is a huge problem for the State.  As the Minister knows, it is also an international problem.  That is why co-operation right across the world is fundamental.</P>
        <P>We all hear or read about murders, shoot-outs and cases of intimidation, but we should not forget the silent and widespread intimidation of communities.  Fear dominates and destroys communities.  Whole areas of our cities and towns and being destroyed by gangs.  Most cases of intimidation are not even reported to the Garda.  We have a duty to face up to that reality.  The men and women across this city who have to face intimidation every single night do not make the news headlines.  Many of us have witnessed at first hand the fear and coercion that is really bad in many communities that have been abandoned by many politicians and by the State.  It is important to deal with this by means of legislation.  That is why I am very supportive of this motion.  I have witnessed on the ground what is going on.  Great courage and bravery have been shown against the odds in many of these communities.  In the 1980s, the late Tony Gregory stood up to the drug dealers and spoke out against organised crime merchants at great personal risk.  I saw that at first hand.  Such brave public service should never be forgotten.  Men and women across the north side of Dublin, in particular, have to deal with this and live with it every single day.  As a country, as a society and as a State, we have to support those people fully.  It is important that we do that.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 was enacted in July 2009 to put certain additional legislative measures in place to tackle organised crime.  Such measures are needed on the ground.  Section 8 of the Act provides that certain organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 are schedule offences of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  Accordingly, the offences in question shall be tried in the Special Criminal Court without prejudice to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct that a person should not be sent forward for trial by that court.  This is the background to this debate.</P>
        <P>We have to appreciate that this is not just about the organised criminals themselves.  We have to examine the economic and social damage caused by such people.  Those involved in organised crime are up to their necks in the cigarette business.  That has not been touched on.  Such activity leads to loss of tax and loss of jobs.  When there is a debate on those directly involved in organised crime, everybody focuses on the drugs trade or armed robberies.  The illegal sale of cigarettes is a huge industry for organised criminals.  That has to be tackled head-on because significant amounts of money and substantial exploitation are involved.  Massive revenues are being lost to the State.  As a smoker who buys 20 cigarettes every day, I know that smokers pay a great deal of tax.  I will not moan about having to pay it, but I will mention that organised criminals are selling cigarettes on the streets and in communities at a fraction of the price they cost in shops.  We often hear about the drugs issue, but there should also be a focus on the cigarettes issue.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I believe we need to invest in disadvantaged communities.  Tony Gregory fought for this in the 1980s.  I was one of those who welcomed the foundation of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the 1990s.  I thought it was important for a State organisation to have the right to take the assets of criminals and organised crime merchants.  When the resources and assets of these people are seized, we should consider ensuring they are reinvested into communities like those mentioned by Deputy O&rsquo;Brien.  I know many people are talking about the huge Priory Hall issue and the families who are affected by pyrite.  Similarly, many blocks of flats throughout this city and in my constituency could do with a little improvement to give them a bit of a leg-up.  The people living in areas where organised criminals are operating on the ground are not looking for a hand-out &mdash; they are looking for community facilities.  There would be cross-party support for any attempt to ensure the money accrued in this way is reinvested in disadvantaged communities that have to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>I strongly support section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which is the important part of that legislation.  It makes it an offence to direct a criminal organisation, participate in and contribute to the activity of a criminal organisation for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of a serious offence, or commit an offence for a criminal organisation.  It also covers such offences as committed by a body corporate.  Section 8 is very important as this is the area we need to target.  No matter what we say, and we can talk about human rights until the end of the world, our priority must be to ensure that the human rights of our citizens come first.  Section 8 must ensure we target these people, get them off the pitch and try to resolve the issues.  However, there is no point in dealing with the criminal justice side unless we also look at the broader response, in particular the position of alienated communities.</P>
        <P>We also need to look at our policing service.  I have seen examples of good practice in regard to people being involved with the drugs squad and similar issues.  There are examples of good practice within the system but there needs to be a national policy across communities.  There are people in communities who are prepared to take a little extra risk provided they get back-up.  The problem is that they often say they do not get the back-up when needed, as I know from walking about my own constituency, meeting people and talking to those who are intimidated on the ground.  Many of them have asked me to report incidents in this regard, which I am sure has happened to many other colleagues as well.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to allow the trials for such offences to take place without a jury in order to avoid the possibility of jury intimidation.  We must face this reality but there is no contradiction in challenging it in order to ensure we always have respect for the human rights side.  It is stated that if the DPP is of the opinion that jury intimidation is not an issue, he may direct that the offence be tried in the ordinary courts.  That is an opt-out clause.  If the DPP decides jury intimidation is not an issue, it is in the ordinary courts that the case should be tried.</P>
        <P>The reality is there is a huge threat from serious organised crime, particularly in regard to smuggling, including that of cigarettes, but also murder, intimidation and the use of firearms and explosives.  A sad point is the lack of response on occasion when incidents happen in poorer communities rather than in more upper middle class areas.  Many people feel that if an incident happens in a certain part of the city, it will be forgotten within three days.  To have young teenage girls shot in the back of cars is not acceptable in any society.  The Minister has heard all the different views.  We need to ensure the human rights of every person in the State, including victims, are protected and given the maximum support regardless of whether they are affluent people or those who are unemployed or who do not necessarily have a lot of money or resources.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  I will always be a watch-guard on human rights but, when it comes to organised crime, we must face reality and we must have the legislative powers to deal with these people.  Otherwise, communities will be destroyed and it will go on and on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Dara Calleary and Finian McGrath for their support for this measure.  I regret that Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien does not see fit to support it.</P>
        <P>To deal with the issues raised, as Deputies Calleary and McGrath referred to CAB, I can confirm I am continuing to engage with my European colleagues in these areas.  We now have published by Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m a new European measure to provide greater co-operation in the seizure of criminal assets following criminal convictions being obtained against individuals in serious cases, and also for the freezing of assets pending the hearing of criminal proceedings.  I am also proceeding to engage with trying to persuade colleagues in Europe that we should have a European-wide framework whereby, within each European Union member state, there is an agency that replicates our Criminal Assets Bureau, so we would have European-wide co-operation on the civil seizure of criminal assets.  I am happy to report to the House that we are having some success in that regard.</P>
        <P>Some of the EU member states have gone about enacting such legislation.  Bulgaria only two weeks ago succeeded in bringing its legislation through parliament and, indeed, we provided some assistance to the Bulgarian minister in the provision of background information.  Slovenia is enacting such legislation and a number of other European countries are also now considering it.  That is an issue that is continuing to develop.  It takes time but we are making progress.</P>
        <P>The reality is organised crime is now international; it does not recognise borders or boundaries.  If we are to be successful in tackling organised crime, we must do what is necessary on this island.  However, we need far greater co-operation on a European-wide approach so those who benefit from organised crime in one EU state do not feel the proceeds realised by them can be safely invested or held in another EU state.</P>
        <P>Turning to what Deputy O&rsquo;Brien had to say, and perhaps this is my attitude when it comes to the Good Friday Agreement, I would use the terms Derry or Londonderry interchangeably.  They are used by the two different communities in Northern Ireland &mdash; the Catholic community refers to Derry, the Protestant community refers to Londonderry.  It is a place I want to see live in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>As I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have hang-ups about which name is attached to it.  I tend to use Derry more frequently than Londonderry simply because of my interest in soccer and catching up with what Derry City do on occasion.  If my interest in soccer could bring about a situation where we had one international team representing the island of Ireland with regard to soccer, as we have in rugby, I wish we could see that happen.  I know other people have expressed that view.  If we are going to truly be successful on the international stage, as successful as our rugby team has been over the years, we need one soccer team that represents the island of Ireland and, indeed, to develop to a maturity where we have one domestic soccer league and second division that covers the island of Ireland.  That would be very welcome.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that we must continue to work the peace process and encourage those who are still intent on violence to end the violence, but we have to be realistic.  I know the Deputy&rsquo;s party has sought to bring about that result.  Unfortunately, to date, some of the more recalcitrant individuals committed to violence and, tragically and sadly, some young people who were not around at the time of the Troubles or were too young to take notice of them, are prepared to kill and maim.  We need robust laws to deal with those issues.  People showed courage to bring about an end to violence and bring about peace, but it is a great pity that those who were ultimately courageous were not courageous a decade or two decades earlier and did not bring the violence to an end at an earlier point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There were different circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s contribution, I agree it is very important we have robust laws that facilitate ensuring that those engaged in organised crime are brought to justice and, indeed, that trials can take place that are free and fair.  As I pointed out, although the powers exist under this section to provide for trials in the Special Criminal Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions can make decisions that do not result in such trials coming before the Special Criminal Court but ensure they are ordinary jury trials.</P>
        <P>I am afraid Deputy O&rsquo;Brien is wrong in one respect.  It is important we have the witness protection programme and we are doing what we can to ensure it is adequately resourced.  Indeed, it has been used very effectively in recent times to provide protection, where necessary.  However, a witness protection programme does not give solace to juries.  People do not want to serve on juries or feel there is a need for a jury protection programme whereby, if they sit on a jury, they may end up having to take themselves and their family out of this country to be relocated somewhere else for fear of intimidation or threats which may result in the death of a member of their family, as happened to the Collins family as a result of evidence given in a particular trial.  We do not need to and should never put jurors in that position.  If organised gangs or individuals are prepared to intimidate jurors and if it is not possible to have a trial that is open and free, where jurors can, with an open mind, listen to evidence and make decisions, we need the fallback position of enabling the Special Criminal Court to hear appropriate cases.  This is very important.  It is the structure we need to keep in place.  For those reasons, I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Returns from across the public service indicate that approximately 7,900 public servants retired during the first three months of this year.  The bulk of these retirements occurred prior to the ending of the grace period on 29 February.  Information received to date by my Department, exclusive of the health sector, shows the number of re-engagements of retired civil and public servants to be approximately 70 so far in 2012.  In addition, in the education sector some 254 secondary teachers and 67 primary teachers have been re-engaged in order to maintain front line services.  These figures are small in comparison to the numbers who have retired.</P>
        <P>The general policy is that staff should not be retained beyond retirement age and any re-engagement should be kept as limited as possible and should be for a very restricted period.  Usually, the rehiring of retirees is related to completion of a specific task where their particular skill or experience is required.  Situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task.  In many instances the most appropriate and cost-effective way of solving a short-term problem is to bring in someone who has worked in the area and understands the background.  In the majority of cases these re-hires are very short-term and project specific and where the short-term nature would not justify the expense of any more formal selection process.</P>
        <P>Where an officer who goes on pension is retained in the public service or is re-employed in the public service in a non-established capacity, the pension is abated.  Such pensioners may never earn more than they would have if they had continued working.  Where a person is re-engaged on a fee-paid basis, the abatement is applied to the fee itself, not the pension.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his response and appreciate the information he has provided.  The main issue on which the people want a response in this regard concerns the biggest category in the public sector, health services, which employ approximately one third of all public servants.  Somewhere along the line, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, must be brought into line with everything happening in the public service.  He has obtained an exemption from the pay ceiling for hospital consultants and there are a couple of thousand hospital consultants earning more than the Taoiseach.  That is wrong.  Every Member of the Cabinet probably knows in his or her heart that this is wrong.  How has the Minister for Health the ability to circumvent the pay ceilings?  I see it as a discourtesy that the HSE or the Minister for Health can allow a situation where the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must come into the D&aacute;il today and say he will have to exclude the health services.  They must be brought to heel at some stage.</P>
        <P>We are not in opposition to the health services, but they are hiding under the radar.  We know they have already gone over budget by &euro;150 million in the first quarter and by July we will see hospital and bed closures.  In the meantime, we will not have been informed of the cost of using agency staff.  Agency nurses are being employed throughout the country and paying them costs more than rehiring nurses as allowed under the existing arrangement.  Is there a legal limit on the number that can be rehired?  The Minister has said the minimum number possible should be rehired.  Is there a limit on the period of time in which these people can be rehired?  Can the Minister establish a limit?  Can he send out a circular to say the limit is six months and that nobody can be rehired after that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This all sounds great in theory, but it is different when it comes down to the specifics.  There are specialist areas where it is very difficult to get a replacement in the short term for somebody who opts out.  The Deputy will be aware of the difficulty we had with regard to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  It was important that person stayed in his post until important work was concluded.  However, I fully agree with the bulk of what Deputy Fleming has said.  I am against the notion of rehiring people who have left and agree the terms for rehiring should be very restricted.  I have had direct discussions with all my colleagues on this.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made a specific point with regard to the health sector.  I regret I do not have the specific numbers on the health area but, as the Deputy pointed out, they are the biggest numbers.  In fairness to the Minister, everybody in the House knows there is a major job of work to do on restructuring the HSE and in fairness to the HSE, the sector has been very proactive in downsizing, in the past 12 months in particular as we saw from the report of the implementation body today.  I am alert to the points made by Deputy Fleming.  This is an issue on which we must keep a close scrutiny to ensure that when we are hiring, we are creating new positions for people new into employment and that people who retire on pensions are retired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister agrees with me with regard to the health service, because we cannot come in here again the next time we have questions on public expenditure and still have a lacuna in terms of information on the health service.  Will the Minister consider issuing a circular setting out a minimum period for which a person can be rehired temporarily?  If the period is over six months, there is a case for hiring somebody new to do the job.  I accept the need to rehire retirees where a project is near completion, where technology is involved and where it could take three to four months to hire staff with the relevant qualifications.  However, there should be a limit on the period for which they can be rehired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, but it is hard to be prescriptive for everybody, because there will be hard cases that will not be amenable to that situation.  The situation does cause me concern and I have, for example, raised it directly with the Minister for Education and Skills.  The notion of teachers retiring and then filling in for colleagues on sick days and maternity leave is wrong.  I do not know whether we need to go a legal route on that, but it is one issue I want to bring to an end.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will provide an update on his Department&rsquo;s Budget 2013 preparations; and if he will confirm the budgetary process for the remainder of the year in advance of the Government&rsquo;s December Budget 2013 expenditure announcements.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[28671/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The medium-term fiscal statement, published in November last year, set out the Government&rsquo;s economic and budgetary assessment for the four year period 2012-15, including the estimated level of fiscal consolidation that is required to bring the general Government deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015, as the Government is committed to doing.  The comprehensive expenditure report, published in December 2011, set out the Government&rsquo;s position as to how the aggregate expenditure would be split across individual Departments for each of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.</P>
        <P>Officials from all Departments are currently working to identify the appropriate policy measures to give effect to the medium-term budgetary adjustment while minimising the impact on public services.  In this regard, I remind the Deputy that as part of the whole of year budgetary approach in the comprehensive expenditure report published, I wrote to all Oireachtas select committees in January of this year inviting them to engage actively with the relevant Departments during this year&rsquo;s Estimates process.  Committees now have an opportunity to engage with the relevant Ministers with regard to next year&rsquo;s allocations.  I am happy to report that a number of committees have informally indicated that they intend to do that.  I also encourage all select committees to give serious consideration to this approach, as it will ensure a much wider engagement by Members of the D&aacute;il in the annual Estimates process in advance of the allocations being agreed at Government level and not afterwards as has been traditional.</P>
        <P>As to the wider budgetary process, I will consult closely with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on arrangements for all budgetary and fiscal announcements for the remainder of the year.  It is also the case that Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary and Estimates timetable is influenced to an increasing extent by requirements at a European level, which apply to all member states.  The introduction of a European semester in 2011 has led to the publication of the annual Stability Programme update in April of each year setting out the parameters for the budgetary process.  The European Council is currently finalising an overall package of economic governance reforms, including the so-called &ldquo;six-pack&rdquo; and &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo;, which will have further implications for the budget and Estimates processes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  What spurred me to raise this issue was a comment made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, with whom the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform works in close collaboration.  He led the public at large to understand that in the event of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the recent referendum, there would be an &ldquo;easier&rdquo; budget.  In light of the Minister&rsquo;s response, could he clarify where the easing will come from?  I have here a copy of the report to which he referred.  I understand from what the Minister said that he intends to plough ahead, taking, for example, a further &euro;3.7 million from community child care subvention &mdash; a sector that, as the Minister well knows, is under siege &mdash; in 2013, and taking a further &euro;1.8 million from school completion projects.  In the context of the broader budgetary mathematics these cutbacks, which were identified in the report, might seem like small sums, but they will have severe implications on the ground.  What on earth was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on about when he mentioned an easier budget?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the European semester and also to the six-pack, and he made reference to its limitations and its implications for our budgetary process.  Could he shed more light on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a number of questions in Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s contribution.  The target for next year is to reach a deficit of 7.5% of GDP.  The quantum of money required to get to that is not defined.  An estimate was published in the last fiscal review, but that needs to be refined because it takes into account inflation and growth, which are constantly under review, as well as external factors.  In my earlier reply I invited the Deputy to involve herself in the detail with line Ministers across each Department, who have all the data with regard to the reduction required to meet the fiscal targets we have set and achieve a deficit of less than 3% of GDP by 2015.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure contains all the measures that might contribute to that, some of which the Deputy may agree with but most of which she will not.  We should engage in a democratic debate on these matters so that people&rsquo;s opinions at a political level are understood.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, logically made the point during the course of the referendum debate that the freedom we have to spend reserves such as the National Pensions Reserve Fund for stimulus purposes, which is our stated intention, in addition to other stimulus measures &mdash; I will deal with that in a separate question &mdash; would have been significantly affected had the people chosen to reject the stability treaty, because our chances of returning to the markets would have been damaged and we would have been required to hold on to as much money as we could to pay for day-to-day public expenditure.  That is clearly what the Minister was saying.</P>
        <P>With regard to the EU semester, there was a proposal in the two-pack to bring forward the budgetary process and align it across the European Union.  The most recent discussions within the budgetary committee in Brussels have indicated that it is unlikely, in my judgment, to be agreed this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister set out what he sees as the logic of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s position.  I take a contrary view; I think he was being rather deceptive in his clear articulation that there would be an easier budget after a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Out of curiosity, did the Minister realise that the Minister for Finance was going to make those comments?</P>
        <P>The target of 7.5% is contingent on a number of factors, not least growth.  While we have figures and targets in the document produced by the Minister, they are a moveable feast.  I appreciate that he wants a democratic debate, but for that to happen effectively we must know the precise parameters.  Those of us on this side of the House must have confidence that whatever observations we make will be taken seriously and that the Minister is not simply attempting to institute a protracted process to take the heat out of what will be another very difficult budget &mdash; not difficult for the Minister, but difficult for the people on the receiving end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I must disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s last comment.  It is very difficult to introduce a consolidation budget.  I would be a much happier Minister if I were in Charlie McCreevy land, the good times were rolling and I could announce spending increases to rapturous applause in the House.  That is not the lot that fell to me or to this unfortunate nation.  We have to map our way out of a difficult economic situation.</P>
        <P>I also disagree with the Deputy about the volume of information she has.  She has the targets for each year, including the 8.6% deficit target we must reach this year, the 7.5% target for next year and the target of 2.9% of GDP by 2015.  She has the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure documentation, which contains voluminous information from every line Department on all options for reducing expenditure.  If there is anything outside of that which the Deputy wishes to put on the table, I would welcome it.  The Deputy says she would be happy to do so if her suggestions were paid heed to.  If they are constructive, that is fine, but if the approach is one of nihilism &mdash; the notion of cutting nothing and opposing all taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are facing into another difficult budget &mdash; I will not gainsay that for a second.  Deputies have seen the figures.  The adjustments for next year are bigger than the adjustments we have imposed for this year.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the changes he proposes to make to the funding and resourcing of individual TDs and political parties; the timeframe for implementation of these changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[28686/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Aside from salaries and other allowances in the nature of pay, there are three main ways that funding and resourcing of individual Deputies and political parties are provided by the taxpayer: first, amounts provided to political parties and independent representatives by way of the party leader allowance; second, payments under the Electoral Acts; and third, allowances paid to Members of each House in respect of their duties as public representatives and in respect of free travelling and other facilities in accordance with Article 15.15 of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The party leader allowance is provided for in the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Act 1938, as amended by the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act 2001.  The allowance is paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party in respect of expenses arising from the parliamentary activities of that party, including research.  Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and elected or nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the preceding general election or a subsequent by-election, or nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann after the preceding general election.  The conditions governing calculation of and entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction on the use of the allowances in the Act is that they may not be used in respect of election expenses.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides that payments may be made to Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann who at the last preceding general election or a subsequent by-election were elected as Members other than as members of qualifying parties.  Such qualifying Independent Deputies are entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152.  A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment of &euro;23,383 for Independent Senators.  I intend to bring proposals on these allowances to the Government shortly.  Any changes proposed following that review will require primary legislation, which is currently being prepared.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the Electoral Acts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Following a major review, a new system of expense allowances payable to Oireachtas Members was introduced in 2010.  I have also reduced the number of pre-paid envelopes Members may receive.  It is my intention to continue to ensure that the greatest value for money can be achieved for payments and expenses of this nature on an ongoing basis consistent with ensuring maximum efficiency and output from Members.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Finally, additional supports for the activities of Members of each House, including secretarial assistance, are provided directly to Members under the auspices of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Since 2004, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has been financed from the Central Fund.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act is amended every three years to provide the Oireachtas funding allocation for the following three years.  The legislation is also amended as necessary to update finance, staffing, and governance procedures.  It is envisaged that amending legislation will be enacted before the end of 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The question encompassed resourcing and funding for all Deputies and political parties.  The Minister did not get a chance to finish the reply.  I will assume &mdash; he may correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the changes being introduced are purely to leaders&rsquo; allowances and allowances for Independent Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that there are no major changes proposed for the political parties.  The Minister might clarify that in his reply.</P>
        <P>We have a major opportunity to lead by example in two ways.  We need radical cuts to political funding and funding for Deputies.  I welcome the vouching of the leader&rsquo;s allowance.  It is extraordinary that I am allowed unvouched payments and I do not think I should.</P>
        <P>As the Minister will be aware, the resources provided to Independent Deputies are a fraction of those paid to Members who are in parties.  For example, Independent Deputies receive one fourth of the amount paid to Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  When one adds the leader&rsquo;s allowance to the Exchequer funding, the funding per Deputy is several times higher in Opposition parties than it is for Independents, while Government parties receive approximately twice as much.  Total expenditure on leaders&rsquo; allowances is &euro;4.8 million annually, based on 2011 figures, with an additional &euro;4 million in Exchequer funding.  Will the Minister consider bringing the total State funding for individual Deputies to the current level paid to Independent Deputies, that is, approximately &euro;40,000 before reducing the amount by a further 10%?  My calculations suggest that we would save the State between &euro;7 million and &euro;10 million if political funding to parties was at the level currently paid to Independent Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on the matter when I publish my suggestions.  The Deputy is wrong on a couple of points, however.  I will be reviewing all allowances, whether to political parties or to Independent Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought he was making an assumption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The claim that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are receiving multiples of what is paid to Independent Deputies is also incorrect.  As an Independent, Deputy Donnelly personally receives &euro;41,152.  The first ten Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies receive &euro;71,000, which is less than twice that paid to Independent Deputies, the next 11 to 30 receive &euro;57,000 each and above 30 the figure is &euro;28,000.  The idea behind this system is that the demands on a major Opposition party in terms of fronting Parliament and analysing major national events are different from the work of an Independent Deputy.</P>
        <P>I am willing to consider these matters in the round.  We have had extensive debates on the funding of politics by business and there was considerable pressure to exclude political donations of all kinds, even personal ones.  From my perspective, I do not see a great difference between a cheque sent from Tony O&rsquo;Reilly in a personal capacity and one from Independent News and Media.  However, if one is to restrict private as well as public funding for political parties, how will the political system continue to operate?  As we saw in the last referendum, there are significant external funders for debates in this country.  I do not think that is healthy but we need to debate these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures I provided are correct.  The figures I received in a parliamentary question solely refer to the leader&rsquo;s allowance.  The Minister cited the Electoral Acts, which give Fianna F&aacute;il an additional &euro;1.1 million.  When one adds the leader&rsquo;s allowance to the funding provided through the Acts, public funding to political parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il is several times that paid to Independent Deputies on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  I can provide the Minister with the figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have them in front of me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that he is going to review all forms of political funding because it needs to decrease across the board.  As part of that review I ask that he consider providing funding directly to Members.  There is nothing in the Constitution on political parties.  Power, authority and the democratic mandate are vested in each of us as Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I suggest that a healthier system would involve the allocation of money to individual Deputies and Senators and, if they then chose to be a member of the Labour Party or other party, it would be up to them to contribute a portion of their resources.  The Constitution does not vest the democratic mandate in parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s argument.  Obviously we come from very different traditions.  I joined a political party to drive the agenda to which I subscribe.  We debate democratically within the party and attend national conferences which provide a space for input from our membership.  I do not come to this House as a sole trader.  I come with a political agenda and I believe Deputies Fleming and McDonald are involved in politics on the same basis.  The essence of our democratic system is not that we ask an array of individuals to represent us but that Governments set out manifestos that will be implemented, sometimes after negotiations on a programme for Government.  The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would fracture the basis of our political system and I, for one, am not keen to pursue it.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Government has no intention of disposing of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The State asset disposal programme that I announced last February refers only to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy generation and supply business.  I made it clear at the time that the rest of the group, which consists of the gas transmission and distribution systems and the two gas interconnectors, will remain in State ownership.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>In deciding that the new Irish Water utility will be an independent State-owned subsidiary of the group, the Government&rsquo;s intention was that a number of key synergies would be achieved between the gas and the water utilities core network functions, such as operating in a regulated environment, network management, metering and utility operation systems.  These core functions will not be impacted by the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, which is a separate business within the group and which operates under a separate management team.  I do not, therefore, propose to exclude Bord G&aacute;is Energy from the disposal programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s perspective on this issue.  I accept it is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention to privatise Bord G&aacute;is completely and that he proposes to give it a new business through a subsidiary which it will own and control.  This subsidiary, Irish Water, will be responsible for the supply of water and sewerage services throughout the country.  The people of Ireland will not be happy and difficulties with non-payment will ensue if they believe he is giving control of their water to a company which is being partially privatised.  They will be afraid that he may plan to sell off Irish Water.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will attempt to allay the Deputy&rsquo;s fears.  It is the Government&rsquo;s firm intention to establish a publicly-owned water utility called Irish Water.  It will be retained in State ownership.  That will be enshrined in legislation and, while we have no control over future Governments, as long as my party is a member of this Government no consideration will be given to the sale of Irish Water.  That is the unanimous decision of both parties in Government and it is our firm commitment. </P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was established to distribute natural gas.  It built up other business but these are not related to its core functions.  Selling off some of the company&rsquo;s capacity to generate electricity in order to increase competition in the market and avoid domination by two publicly owned utilities is a pro-energy and pro-business stance which the Deputy opposite would normally be inclined to support.</P>
      
      </Speaker>

	<P>On the sale of State assets, I judge each case on its merits.  I do not have a philosophical objection, nor am I am supporter of a philosophy on it.  The Minister is saying he is selling key State assets that are not part of the core of Bord G&aacute;is.  Irish Water is not part of the core of Bord G&aacute;is and people feel it will fall into the same category.  I accept the Minister means what he says but it accounts for nothing in the real world.  The view that the Minister would not like to see something happen is not a legal commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy did not hear.  We are writing it into the law of the land so it is a legal commitment.  Every Parliament is sovereign so we have no control over what a future Parliament will do.  As far as this Parliament and this Government is concerned, the utility will be a wholly-owned State utility.  Most parties in the House and most Independents see it as the correct course.  I do not see any push to have it privatised because the experience of privatised water in the UK is not good.</P>
        <P>I am not enthusiastic about the general principle of selling State assets.  We made a decision about what we are putting on the market.  These are not strategic assets and will allow the leveraging of money to invest in new jobs.  In Irish Water, we are creating the biggest new State utility since the ESB.</P>

        <Quest>  the stage at which his privatisation programme is currently at and taking into account the job losses that arose from the previous privatisation and part privatisation of State assets, if he has undertaken an impact assessment study of the likely job losses that will arise from the sale of State assets; and if he has conducted a study of the way such losses would compare with jobs alleged to be created with the proceeds.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[28689/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to report that the State asset disposal programme has made significant progress since I announced its content last February.  The respective inter-departmental steering groups established at that time to prepare the assets for disposal have examined comprehensive financial reports by NewERA on Bord G&aacute;is Energy, BGE, and Coillte and work is also proceeding on identifying the electricity generation assets of ESB to be included in the sale programme.</P>
        <P>Under the EU-ECB-IMF funding programme, the Government remains committed to outlining in detail for the troika, by the end of this month, the specific regulatory, legislative, corporate governance and financial reforms that need to be taken in 2012 to allow for the State asset disposal programme to proceed in 2013.  A calendar with indicative timelines for sales will be set out.  The issues requiring resolution having already been identified by the end of the first quarter and we published that in the report of the last troika visit.  Work is continuing now in the relevant Departments and agencies on considering how they should be addressed in order to facilitate the launch of sale transactions in 2013.</P>
        <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question on job losses, the inter-departmental steering groups mentioned earlier are charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with identifying any implications for employment that arise from the asset sales in question.  I do not necessarily accept the implication in the Deputy&rsquo;s question that job losses will be inevitable.  Part of the receipts from the sale of assets will be retained for reinvestment.  The sale of certain business units of State companies may offer the prospect of access to significant new capital to grow these businesses, which might not otherwise be available given the current position in capital markets.  The BGE sale and the proposed divestment of some of the ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation assets also presents an opportunity to achieve wider economic benefits by introducing new players into the Irish market, thereby leading to increased competition, which should, hopefully, increase efficiency, drive down costs and lead to reduced prices to consumers and businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Any progress on the privatisation of State-owned assets, meaning assets owned by the people, is not something to be pleased about.  I ask the Minister to recognise the serious implications for the protection of jobs in the privatisation process.  In an appalling development in 2009, 1,300 high-quality aircraft engine maintenance jobs were lost mainly at Dublin Airport when a multinational company, SR Technics, closed down peremptorily.  Does the Minister accept this happened because of the privatisation of Team Aer Lingus?  Does he recognise that vulture capitalists will move in to take ready-made assets when they are only interested in private profit, not the jobs and security of employment of Irish people?  It is repulsive to a majority of people in this country that the troika, representing the interests of the financial markets and bondholders, dictates to this State &mdash; and that the dictation is acceded to by the Government &mdash; that public assets are sold off in this way rather than developed and invested in to create tens of thousands of jobs.</P>
        <P>Is the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, that the troika is demanding Aer Lingus to be totally privatised at the beginning of next year, accurate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>For many years, I have known Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s view on State industry and private industry.  He regards one as all good and the other as all bad.  I do not have the same philosophical view and I believe there is room for a dynamic State sector, which we need to protect and enhance, but not everything in the State sector is, by definition, good.  Neither is everything in the private sector, by definition, bad.  I will provide Deputy Higgins with a concrete example from my constituency.  The State-owned company, ESB, sold Great Island power station to a private company called Endesa.  From being a mothballed generating station owned by the State, it is now a facility in which the company invested &euro;300 million and it is bringing natural gas to my county for the first time.  It has the potential to create many jobs.  We want to be smart in terms of utilising resources and looking to the next generation of State companies, including Irish Water, to generate jobs and provide the infrastructure for further jobs.  The sale of BGE grew up from a company designed to distribute gas and built up a generating capacity from wind farms to gas power generating stations.</P>
        <P>To sell off the generating element of the company and create real competition with a State company will test the mettle of the ESB.  It is well fit for purpose and it will be good for the business and private consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not realise preparation for the privatisation of the electricity generation has been going on for years?  So-called competition has been a farcical joke, with the price of electricity increased by the regulator so that venture capitalists are tempted into the market by increased profits to create competition.  What kind of a joke of a way is that to carry on?</P>
        <P>The Minister did not answer me with regard to Aer Lingus.  Is the troika pressing for its privatisation?</P>
        <P>The Minister has not carried out an impact study comparing what jobs could be lost, as in many privatised industries, and the damage done.  The Telecom &Eacute;ireann privatisation did major damage to investment potential in this country as venture capitalists asset stripped for private profit.  What percentage of funds will the troika allow to be invested if the Government sells it off?  I will oppose it at every hand&rsquo;s turn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  I fundamentally disagree with the way Eircom was privatised.  It was a strategic company providing a strategic service.  That is why we are not selling off any of the strategic distribution lines of gas or electricity in this country.  We are determined not to make those awful mistakes.  I also agree with the point of Deputy Higgins in respect of artificial competition.  The notion that energy competition is one State company being forced to keep high prices while another State company takes its business is a nonsense.  I agree with Deputy Higgins and that is why we need real competition, with a State company unleashed to compete in a real market with, hopefully, an external player that will drive down the cost of energy for all consumers.  That is what we want to achieve, without being captured by any ideology of the past.</P>
        <P>There is no pressure on us on the sale deadline for Aer Lingus.  We will only sell State assets if there is a fair market price.  This is also true of BGE.  If circumstances are not opportune when we get to the market, that will be my recommendation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a tabular reply so there is a slight difficulty.  I will read the response and I will endeavour to help the Deputy with any of the tabulated particulars.  I do not have a spare printed copy to give the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The estimated gross monthly pay and pensions bill for the period June 2011 to April 2012, as notified by Departments and offices, in respect of public service workers, is set out in the table which follows the text of this reply.  It should be noted that the estimated figures notified in respect of 2012 are subject to change due to ongoing reconciliation by Departments and offices as data becomes available.  Month on month figures are significantly influenced by the number of pay days and pension lump sums paid in each month.  The figures exclude pay and pension expenditure by local authorities and do not take account of the pension-related deduction on public service remuneration.  Monthly returns in respect of the pay and pensions costs incurred in May 2012 by Departments are currently being collated.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to provide the figures in respect of the pay bill for the months at the start and end of the period as set out in the tabulated return, the top and tail figures for June 2011 and May 2012 and likewise in respect of the pension bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In June 2011, total pay was &euro;1,218,901,000.  The pension bill for the same month was &euro;203,939,000, a total pay and pension bill in June 2011 of &euro;1,422, 840,000.  In April 2012, total pay was &euro;1,134,191,000.  The total pension bill payable in April 2012 was &euro;247,975,000, giving a total pay and pension bill of &euro;1,382,166,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had this discussion before in respect of the pay and pension bill.  The Minister&rsquo;s strategy from the outset in respect of what he terms reform was simply to cut out head count, to reduce the pay and pensions bill.  He regarded this as a major savings initiative.  The report of the Croke Park implementation group is due to be published today and this question is related.  We have never got to the bottom of the real savings to the Exchequer in net terms as a result of all of the cutbacks and the hacking away of the public service and the loss of staff from the system.  This is the nub of the issue.  The manner in which the Minister deals with what he calls reform in the public sector is wrong-headed.  It is not just about head count.  I have set this out in some detail on other occasions.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge we are discussing the top and tail figures from the tabulated return but for all the bluster and the hardship endured by the front line staff, the savings are not significant.  To return to a bugbear of mine, it highlights the real pity of the Minister&rsquo;s failure to address the issue of very high pay.  I refer in particular to those in the public and Civil Service who are on salaries of &euro;100,000 and above and the kind of pension pots that still persist to this day, along with the exceptional payments made to people when they exit employment.  These are all live issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has been consistently wrong on every issue.  She regards rhetoric as being a substitute.  I suggest she reads the report of the implementation group which is published today.  Head count is one element but it also includes fundamental reform.  This reform is accruing real benefits in monetary terms to the State.  It is fanciful to say what the Deputy has just stated and to talk about month by month figures because there are variants within months such as particular issues which arise and the number of pay days in a month and so on.  One must look at the whole period in question and this is what has been done independently by the implementation group.  It has indicated that in the 12-month period under review from the end of March 2011 to the end of March 2012, a total of &euro;650 million in payroll savings have been made.  Deputy Fleming shares the Deputy&rsquo;s view that this is abated by a pension contribution but people have paid for 40 years for their pensions and this is included in the arithmetic anyway &mdash; unless the Deputy is suggesting they should not receive their pensions.  The vast majority are ordinary workers and the vast majority of pensions are modest in size.</P>
        <P>The real savings in pay terms is &euro;650 million in a year.  The non-pay savings amounts to an additional &euro;370 million.  This is as a result of a change in Garda rosters, a change to which had been discussed for the past 40 years.  There has been a change in the rosters in the health service.  A total of 4,500 people have been deployed in the health service in the past year and this could not have been done without the Croke Park agreement.  A total of 1,200 teachers have been redeployed, as well as 750 F&Aacute;S workers and 1,000 community welfare officers.  There have been very great changes which include better procurement procedures.  This has all been driven by the reform agenda which the Deputy is not bothered to actually read.</P>
        <P>The Civil Service reform agenda includes more than 200 actions and I presented it to the committee of which the Deputy is a member.  She knows I have established a reform office in my Department which is responsible for driving change.  However, there are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 7 and 35 together.</P>
        <P>The implementation body has completed its second annual review and published this morning its second annual report of progress under the Croke Park agreement.  In my view, the body has once again produced a very comprehensive, detailed and robust report.  The report analyses the pay and non-pay efficiency savings being delivered under the agreement.  It also examines the change and reform being delivered in each sector of the public service and highlights examples of improved productivity that have been achieved as the decreased number of staff respond to increased demand for many public services.</P>
        <P>The body has found that pay bill savings in the order of &euro;650 million were achieved between April 2011 and March 2012, driven primarily by a significant reduction in staff numbers of 11,530.  Furthermore, the body sought to factor in an estimate for planned recruitment to fill critical positions later this year, following the retirement of some 8,000 staff in the first quarter of this year, in order to arrive at an estimate of the sustainable pay bill savings that might be achieved.  This yields an estimated net sustainable pay bill saving of &euro;521 million.  In addition, the body found that &euro;370 million in administrative efficiencies or non-pay savings were achieved.</P>
        <P>The body engaged external financial advisors to undertake an independent verification of the savings being reported in the case of a small sample of projects.  Following a tendering process, Grant Thornton were engaged to evaluate four projects.  They found that the savings reported by management in each of the four projects were reasonable estimates of savings; the methodology used for each project was found to be acceptable; and the agreement is playing a significant role in facilitating the implementation of the savings initiatives in each case.  The Grant Thornton report was published in parallel with the report of the implementation body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given a glowing account of what is contained in the second report of the implementation group but I asked what are his criteria for assessing the report.  I note the figures for the reduction in staff numbers are good and the public sector pay bill has been reduced and I note the non-pay savings.  What has been the cost of the severance payments for the 11,500 staff who left this year?  I would estimate the average cost would be at least &euro;70,000 per person.  What is the cost?  It is not in that report.  Maybe they will say it is not their job, but it is certainly the Minister&rsquo;s job to inform this House of the cost of the severance payments.</P>
        <P>I also want the Minister to clarify the figures supplied by his Department.  Will he comment on the fact that the public sector pay bill from 2009 to 2011 fell by 4% per annum, whereas the figures from 2012 to 2015 are only to fall by 1.75%?  The chart in the report refer to a gross public sector pay bill in 2009 of &euro;17.5 billion and compares it to the net pay bill in 2015, but that is nonsense.  The report does not even compare, in the same sentence, gross or net figures with their equivalents.  It mixes and matches them to give a bigger figure, which does not tally with the chart that is printed there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have the report in front of him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I have, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>If he looks at page 4 he will see, in table 3, the Exchequer pay bill in gross terms for each year from 2009 to 2015.  It is comparing exactly like with like across the top, beginning with the 2009 gross figure of &euro;17.514 billion and ending in 2015 with the Exchequer gross figure of &euro;14.6 billion.  It is therefore comparing like with like.  Has the Deputy read the table at all?  I was asked a question on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; on foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, saying there were no pension figures in it, but they are on the same page in the next table.  The Deputy should read the tables before he asks questions and issues statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister a question about severance costs, not about pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer that separately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I want that figure either now or in the immediate future.  It is not there.  The HSE&rsquo;s chief executive told the Committee of Public Accounts that it is costing &euro;380 million up front to achieve a saving of &euro;80 million net per annum in the HSE.  He broke down those figures at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister has misread his own chart.  The bottom line on chart No. 3 refers to an Exchequer pay bill net of PRD, public related deduction, which goes from &euro;16.7 billion in 2009 to &euro;13.7 billion in 2015.  That is a reduction of &euro;3 billion, yet the figure in the chart is &euro;3.8 billion.  That figure is not a correct assessment of the bottom line the Minister quoted.  It is a simple fact that the Minister quoted the wrong figure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy wants to mix and match himself now.</P>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He said the gross figures were not there, but they are in the published report.  This is not my report; it is from the implementation body.  Let me be quite clear because we can lose things in figures.  The bottom line is that in the reference period in question we have reduced the pay bill, independently validated not by my Department but by the implementation body, in gross terms by &euro;650 million.  There will be some add back because it involves 11,500 people leaving the service.  I have indicated that there will be some recruitment this year.  They have made an attempt to quantify what that might cost, indicating that the net payroll savings will be of the order of &euro;520 million.  By 2015, our aim is to reduce the public pay bill from its peak by &euro;3.8 billion gross or &euro;3.3 billion net of pension.  That is a significant reduction in anyone&rsquo;s language.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s point that a reduction in numbers is only part of this whole dynamic.  The reform side of it is as important, which is what I want to concentrate on in order to get different delivery mechanisms and rosters.  For example, we want to ensure we are deploying garda&iacute; when they are most needed and that we have optimum use of resources in hospitals so that staff will match equipment availability.  That is the drive for reform that is happening in parallel to the reduction in numbers.  The fact that we are doing that in an atmosphere of industrial peace is a great credit to public service workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>On that note, I would be the first to acknowledge and give credit to people working within the public service and Civil Service.  Here is the Minister&rsquo;s difficulty, however &mdash; he has a figure of &euro;3.3 billion, which is his target.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Net.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>That goes to the point that has been raised repeatedly with the Minister and at the Committee of Public Accounts, which is that we need the net figures.  Aside from any value judgment one might make on the rights and wrongs of the process, including the effect it is having on the front line, it is entirely proper and legitimate that we are given the net figures.  We have had to question individual Accounting Officers to try to get to the bottom of what the figures actually are.  It is much more useful for us, as legislators involved in public policy, to have net figures.  The Minister has a net target so he should be able to give us the net figures also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Here is my question to the Minister &mdash; he says it is not just about a head-count, but is also about reform.  The Minister has been more than cautious in addressing issues of culture within the public sector, particularly at the upper echelons.  He has almost been afraid to deal with some of the obvious issues, including high pay and pension pots.  The Minister has run away from that.  Redeployments have happened, as have cuts for civil and public servants on modest incomes, and they are feeling the pain as a result.  When it comes to playing the game with the big boys, however, it strikes me that the Minister does not have the belly for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is either living in a bubble or is deliberately ignoring the facts, because no Minister has been more proactive in reducing high-level pay than I have.  I set the ceiling for civil servants at &euro;200,000.  As of now, no civil servant is paid more than &euro;200,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The French President does not earn &euro;200,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that we have pushed people&rsquo;s salaries down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, so what is the Minister&rsquo;s point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We introduced a referendum to cut judges&rsquo; pay.  I have introduced new financial emergency measures in the public interest to implement that and other reductions, including pensions to further abate those with high public service pensions.  It is absolutely wrong to say that we have not been active on that front.  It is popular to trot out the same old thing and Deputy McDonald is addicted to popular phrases as opposed to reality.  The head-count issue is important because we need to reduce public service numbers, but the Deputy is right in that it is not the solution in itself.  We need reform in order to do things differently and that is why we are engaging through the implementation body with the sectoral committees to bring about real reform in service delivery.  We are doing things differently, including shared services.  The Civil Service shared human resource service is in the process of being set up, and we will follow that through with other shared services, including payroll management and pension costs.  We are identifying leave arrangements, including sick leave, and are currently in the Labour Court on that matter.  We are moving on a variety of fronts.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy is interested, we will come back to the committee again to present the latest instalment of where we are on the 200 aims of the civil servants&rsquo; reform programme.  We are ambitious and are doing things that have not been done in a generation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot let this pass.  The Minister is blowing his trumpet about a &euro;200,000 pay cap.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can rely on Deputy McDonald to keep blowing her trumpet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hold on a second.  Does the Minister know that the Finnish prime minister earns &euro;129,000 and the French president does not earn &euro;200,000?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has already made that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>What bubble is the Minister in when he imagines that a salary of &euro;200,000 is some cruel and unusual punishment or hardship?  That is ludicrous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>How much is Deputy Adams earning?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that segment, which arguably is the most in need of reform.  The Minister has run away from that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A final reply from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Deputy runs out of truth, she puts words in my mouth.  I never said anything about cruel and unusual punishment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did so in committee some weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can shout me down if she wishes.  I regard that level of salary as high.  That is the reason the Government set it as a ceiling for the Taoiseach.  Ministers are paid less than that.  In net terms, the Taoiseach earns 44% less than a Taoiseach did in 2008 and Ministers are earning 40% less.  They are still on a handsome salary; there is no doubt about that.  However, we should acknowledge what has been done.  Deputy McDonald acknowledges nothing, except herself.  She does not remember her party&rsquo;s past and is only interested in the sins of others.  In truth, we have a reform agenda which we are delivering on.  A report independently validated shows the progress made.  The Deputy should for once have the good grace to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of public servants who are driving reform and making the change.  </P>

        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of agency and contract staff currently employed in the public sector; the mechanism in place for monitoring and managing the associated costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[28294/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size of the public service pay bill.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years, enhanced numbers, monitoring systems and multi-annual employment frameworks have been put in place.  These arrangements will be strengthened to ensure that effect is given to Government decisions on public service numbers, including temporary staff.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to reducing public service numbers to 282,500 by the end of 2015 as part of its reform agenda.  The overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.   However, I wish to make clear that it is part of the day-to-day function of the management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within existing resources.  Again, it is a matter for local management to determine the appropriate recruitment method for such temporary staff.  This data is not held centrally.</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department, there are 21 persons currently working in a non-established capacity on fixed-term contracts and contracts of indefinite duration<i>.</i>  In addition, there is one contractor working in the IT unit in the role of senior technical network service administrator.  The IT unit undertakes a market exercise each year to fill the senior technical role position.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is under the aegis of my Department, currently has ten contract audit staff, whose work is expected to amount to approximately 4.4 whole-time equivalents in the calendar year.  The staff are all professionally qualified and assist that office during periods of peak demand for audit services.  The use of these contract staff is fully sanctioned and is limited by the amount of sanction granted.  The office also has two whole-time equivalent agency staff who provide front of house security and reception-telephony services and eight students on internship from the University of Limerick, who work with audit teams for about nine months during the year before returning to their studies.  The office provides any information requested of it to my Department on monitoring and managing costs.</P>
        <P>As data on the number of agency and contract staff currently employed in the public sector is not held centrally it would be a matter for individual Departments to provide details to the Deputy in respect of their agency and contract staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, the final sentence of which answers my question.  I was not asking about the number of contract staff in the Minister&rsquo;s Department or in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office, although I am surprised at the numbers given by the Minister in that regard, but about my hobby horse, the health service, where there are vacancies in hospitals countrywide for nurses and so on.</P>
        <P>There are many agency nurses in our hospitals, in respect of whom there are separate staffing schedules and rotas, and to whom the embargo does not apply, which I understand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister make it his business to get this information compiled centrally so that somebody at Government level has a handle on it?  It is not on to have this information dispersed with no one knowing what is going on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and will try to address it.  It is a matter of annoyance that this sector is always a little later than every other in providing information to me.  The Deputy might consider having the HSE invited to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue, which debate I will listen to with great interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the same question of the Minister in the autumn.  As per the Minister&rsquo;s reply, I sought and obtained, and continue to receive, statistics on the number of contract and temporary staff in the public sector from various agencies operating under the aegis of his Department and, crucially, the comparison between the cost to the Exchequer of employing agency staff versus direct employees.</P>
        <P>It seems to me that a Government that is willing and able to impose brutal cuts and austerity on people on social welfare such as rent allowance and so on and on the incomes of workers should show the same zeal in terms of ensuring we are getting value for money when it comes to the massive amount of outsourcing that is resulting from the cuts in the number of directly employed people within the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to have a centrally held record of the number of agency staff employed across the public sector and a comparison in terms of how much it would cost if those people were directly employed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This question was not tabled by the Deputy.  Other Deputies wish to get answers to their questions.  I call the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to be prescriptive about this because there will be cases where agency workers are the best way of meeting an urgent public demand for services and where, without them, central services might not function.  There might be a case for that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fleming is looking at the broader picture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister continues to cut numbers he will need more of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is we are faced with reducing the total volume of money we can borrow.  The only people who will lend us money have attached conditions to it.  We can stick our heads in the ground and pretend that is not a reality.  We need to reduce the quantum of money we are borrowing.  There are a variety of ways of doing so, including cutting services, making them more efficient and reducing the numbers involved in service delivery.  These are hard decisions.  I know the Deputy is not interested in engaging with them and prefers the soft option that there is no need for retrenchment or taxation of any kind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to know if it is saving money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to continue his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the final part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question quite seriously.  We do need to ensure that wherever we are engaging with agency or temporary staff there is a robust business case for it and that it makes economic sense.  That is part of the culture which I am trying to inculcate across all State agencies and Departments.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will provide an update on the progress made regarding the Regulation of Lobbying Bill.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[28249/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and rules governing the conduct of lobbying.  In addition, the public service reform programme, launched in November 2011, contains a commitment to prepare legislation to meet these objectives through the publication of legislation early in 2013.  My Department is currently engaged in developing proposals for consideration by me and, in due course, the Government on implementation of these commitments. </P>
        <P>A review of international approaches to the regulation of lobbyists was commenced late last year.  In December 2011, submissions were invited from interested parties on key issues relating to options for the design, structure and implementation of an effective regulatory system for lobbying in Ireland.  The consultation process was based on the agreed OECD Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying which was the subject of a recommendation by the OECD Council in February 2010.  The response to the consultation process was positive, with approximately 60 organisations and individuals submitting views to my Department.</P>
        <P>A policy paper is being finalised on the basis of further research and analysis, in particular on the key issues highlighted in the submissions received as well as from subsequent meetings with some contributors to the consultation process undertaken.  I intend to publish this paper shortly to communicate the main elements of the proposed lobbying legislation.  Following publication of the paper, a public seminar will be held in July to provide a further opportunity for discussion on the proposals, in particular on the key implementation issues raised during the consultation process.</P>
        <P>Preliminary work has commenced on the preparation of an outline scheme of a lobbying Bill for approval by the Government in due course based on the lobbying regulations in other jurisdictions as well as several Private Members&rsquo; Bills published on this topic over the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  Perhaps I did not catch it but did the Minister give an indicative date for the publication of the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to have a paper published very shortly but the Bill itself will be published early next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I raise this is because while I am aware of the process undertaken with regard to the submissions, I am also aware that in March the Minister told us he would publish a paper within weeks.  This month his party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, stated the heads of the Bill were expected by the end of the summer.  In sum, my concern is that there is some foot dragging on this.  I do not think I need to emphasise to the Minister how important this legislation is.  It needs to be robust and fit for purpose but it also needs to be published.  We need a firm timetable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.  She is aware I published a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this subject but it is a complicated issue.  Lobbying is legitimate and every citizen and representative group should be able to lobby, whether it is a group representing the unemployed, farmers, single parents or anybody else.  The issue is that it must be done in a regulated way that is transparent and in accordance with best practice and we also need to avoid undue influence in the hands of some.  This is an important part of the body of legislation on transparency the Government will enact.  I would welcome the Deputy to the forum we will hold in July to hear ideas.  I will produce papers and the submissions received to date and we will see how we can take it forward.  We are already working on the draft heads of the Bill so the T&aacute;naiste is correct in this regard.  It may be preferable to bring the heads of Bill to the committee rather than the completed Bill.  I have an open mind on this and I will be interested to hear the Deputy&rsquo;s views on it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  in view of his proposal to use funds realised from the sale of State assets for job creation, his views on European research which shows that privatisation has a largely negative effect on employment and working conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[26482/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I am unaware of the particular research to which the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers, and he might indicate what it is as I could not find it, I would not necessarily accept that such findings can be extrapolated either generally or to the particular context of the programme of State asset disposals I announced last February.</P>
        <P>In dealing with the troika it has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that funds released from asset disposals should be used to support job creating initiatives in the economy.  After long-term negotiations, I recently reached agreement with troika representatives that all such proceeds would be available, in one shape or another, for this purpose.  Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature.  The other half, while destined eventually to pay down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to guarantee additional lending into Ireland, for example by the European Investment Bank, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.</P>
        <P>Apart from the receipts from the sale of assets which the Government will retain for reinvestment, the sale of certain business units of State companies may also offer the prospect of access to significant new capital to grow these businesses, which might not have otherwise have been available given the current position in capital markets.  The Bord G&aacute;is Energy sale and the proposed divestment of some of the ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation assets also present an opportunity to achieve wider economic benefits by introducing new players into the Irish energy market thereby leading to increased competition, which should, hopefully, increase efficiency, drive down costs and lead to reduced prices for consumers.</P>
        <P>Last April&rsquo;s announcement of the establishment of the new Irish water utility under the umbrella of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann amply demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continued confidence in the semi-State sector as both a vehicle for large-scale infrastructural investment and a driver of innovative change, and we will continue to ensure the State sector plays a vital part in the generation of jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The research to which I referred in the question was an EU funded project entitled Privatisation of Public Services and the Impact on Quality, Employment and Productivity.  It examined the impact of privatisation and liberalisation of public services in five European countries, namely, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK.  Case studies across six different sectors found that following liberalisation and privatisation the main company objective, that is the reduction of production costs, was achieved primarily at the cost of workers mainly through the worsening of working conditions.  The report states, &ldquo;The balance of evidence suggests that liberalisation and privatisation have been primarily associated with employment reductions rather than with employment creation and that, at the same time, employment within the target sectors has become increasingly part-time, often having greater recourse than when they were publicly delivered services to self-employed, and perhaps also temporary, workers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The project concurs with many others in its findings that positive effects and better performance are mostly the result of superior regulation rather than of competition or private corporate initiative.  Liberalisation and privatisation of public services have largely negative effects on employment and working conditions and varied effects on productivity and service quality.  I am not sure whether the Government has conducted a cost benefit analysis on how this will work out.  Will it really create extra quality jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>If I cannot find the report he mentioned I will get my office to contact the Deputy to ensure the review group takes full account of it.  The experience of privatisation is not uniform and it depends on what is privatised and the method used.  Our experience in the State of the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann was disastrous in my judgment.  It was a wholly wrong decision to privatise a strategic company like that, which is why we will not go down this road.  What we have put on the table to meet the troika requirement is the energy division of a State company.  We already have a very elaborate company, namely, the ESB, in electricity generation.  Do we need two State companies competing with one another or would it be better to have a dynamic private sector company competing with a State company and let the State company match it?  Earlier we debated the fairly ludicrous situation we had in the past where we had two State companies in the energy sector, one of which was required by instruction from the Minister with responsibility for energy not to reduce its prices so the other State company could get a bigger market share.  This was supposed to amount to competition but this is nonsense.</P>
        <P>There are specific instances of privatisation being very successful and the Deputy will know the example of Great Island power station very well as it is not far from his home base.  Endesa, a private company, has bought a mothball power station and is bringing national gas into the county, which is very important.  It is investing heavily in bringing the power station back onstream.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister with regard to the Great Island power station.  However, I disagree with the notion that we should sell assets because the troika thinks we should do so.  This is not healthy and it will not create jobs in the long term.  The Great Island power station was lying idle and selling it to someone prepared to get involved at a commercial level was a good idea.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, I know he was late but at least he is in attendance.  I believe this is the second time I have spoken on the topic of Syria and the situation has become graver.  Given that Ireland is a member of the OSCE, of which we hold the chairmanship, we must voice our deepest concerns at the highest diplomatic level about the ongoing desperate situation in Syria, which appears to be on the brink of civil war.  The UN has been trying to broker a ceasefire between opposing sides in recent months but it appears that has not been successful and the entire situation has escalated into one of horrific proportions.</P>
        <P>If the latest reports from that country are to be believed, children are bearing the brunt of this civil unrest.  Herein lies a great difficulty as the Syrian Government restricts journalists from moving freely, making it nearly impossible to independently verify accounts from either side.  This action speaks volumes &mdash; why would it restrict coverage if it had nothing to hide?  Very worrying reports are coming from the UN that children are being beaten, abused, tortured and subjected to sexual abuse.  One report quoted a witness as saying several dozen boys and girls, between the ages of eight and 13, were forcibly taken from their homes and used by soldiers and militia members as human shields.  An estimated 1,200 children have been killed in the 15-month conflict.</P>
        <P>The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, said the report had uncovered many grave violations against children.  The report was completed before the Houla massacre in Syria on 25 May, when 49 of the 108 victims were said to be children, who were shot in the head or had their skulls smashed with blunt instruments.  We must act now.  I am reminded of the quote, &ldquo;The world is a dangerous place, not because of the evil men do, but because of those that stand idly by and do nothing&rdquo;.  It has gone well past that time and we cannot just stand idly by.  While our thoughts are elsewhere on economic affairs in Europe, we must act at this stage and bring pressure to bear given that we hold the chairmanship of the OSCE.  Members of the OSCE include the United States and Russia, which have a very large role to play.  We need to do whatever we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise the matter.  I echo the sentiments Deputy Ann Phelan eloquently expressed.  I am conscious that the T&aacute;naiste has been active on the matter and that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade will meet tomorrow for a special discussion on the issue.  It is vital that parliaments discuss the crisis which is now of gargantuan proportions.  There is a particular onus on those of us in the EU to take unified action.  The European Union was a social and economic Union of great success.  It has also, in itself, been very successful peace project.  It behoves us to unite in a way that the UN has failed to do effectively in addressing the matter.  We need to focus on the failure of the UN Security Council to address this dreadful crisis given the stance being adopted by the Russian and Chinese delegations in their own national interests.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste and other European foreign Ministers to liaise directly with their counterparts in Russia and China.  It would be useful to call in the ambassadors of those two states.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> carries horrific reports from the US Secretary of State, Ms Clinton, that the Russian Government is supplying attack helicopters to Syria to massacre its own people.  The international community cannot stand idly by and accept what is going on in Syria where a monstrous regime is attacking and killing its own people.  I echo what has been said about children in particular.  While war &mdash; particularly civil war &mdash; is regrettable in every circumstance, to attack helpless, innocent children and put them at the forefront of this conflict is totally unacceptable and disgusts the Irish people.  It goes to the heart of our belief in the need for us as an independent voice in Europe to stand up and be heard and not to allow ourselves to be in any way inhibited by our membership of the UN or EU.  While acknowledging that the T&aacute;naiste has been active, I ask him to redouble his efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Ann Phelan and &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for raising this urgent matter.  The Government shares the concern of all right-thinking people at the escalating conflict in Syria which is now estimated to have claimed well over 10,000 lives in the past 15 months.  There has been particular revulsion at the massacre in Houla on 25 and 26 May where more than 100 people, including 49 children, died as well as the reported mass killing of 78 people in the village of Al-Qubeir on 6 June.  The T&aacute;naiste has strongly condemned both these atrocities, including in statements issued on 27 and 30 May.  Such atrocities, as well as the latest reports regarding the fate of the town of Haffa and the use of attack helicopters, provide further unwelcome testimony of the Syrian regime&rsquo;s utter disdain for human life and the welfare of its own people.</P>
        <P>In the face of such atrocities, the Syrian people have every right to expect that there will be accountability and those responsible will be ultimately held to account.  Ireland welcomes the strong statement issued by EU High Representative on 3 June on this issue.</P>
      
        <P>The EU also actively worked to secure adoption of a resolution by the UN Human Rights Council on 1 June which extends the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry in Syria to investigate the events at Houla and report to the UN Security Council on possible criminal prosecutions.  Referral of the situation in Syria by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court also remains an option and is one which the Government has already made clear it would be happy to support.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Despite the difficulties it is facing, the Annan plan remains the only agreed plan for ending the violence and promoting a peaceful transition in Syria.  As joint UN-Arab League Special Envoy, Kofi Annan intimated to the UN Security Council last week that the problem lies not with his six-point plan but with getting the parties who have agreed it to honour their commitments.  In particular, all parties should immediately cease all form of hostilities and the Assad regime must ensure the complete withdrawal of heavy weaponry and troops from population centres, the release of all political detainees and ensure free access to all, including media, humanitarian organisations and the UN.  The humanitarian situation within Syria remains critical, with upwards of 1 million in need of assistance.  Irish Aid has already provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding to assist the situation.</P>
        <P>It is also critical that the UN Supervision Mission in Syria, UNSMIS, to which Ireland is contributing six officers, is allowed fulfil its mandate and enjoys full freedom of movement as well as security for its personnel.  Recent attempts to prevent observers from carrying out their monitoring duties are completely unacceptable.  The Minister for Defence is continuing to monitor the situation closely, with a view to ensuring the safety and security of the Irish officers serving with UNSMIS.  If the Syrian regime or any other party continues to fail to meet their obligations under the plan, further action by the UN Security Council, including the imposition of sanctions, should be considered.  This obviously argues for closer engagement with Russia, as it remains the country best placed to exert influence on the Syrian authorities at present.  Special Envoy Annan has advocated an international contact group in this regard and this should be considered.  Ireland is already active within the Friends of Syria group and will be represented at the next meeting of the group in Paris on 6 July.</P>
        <P>No interest will be served by intensifying the conflict through either external military intervention or arming the opposition since we can already observe the impact which the Syrian crisis is having on the wider region, not least in neighbouring Lebanon.  Pressure also must be maintained on the Syrian opposition to coalesce and agree a common platform, since this is an essential element for the Annan plan to succeed.  Ultimately, an end to all violence as well as to Bashar Al-Assad&rsquo;s rule and an urgent political transition are required to resolve this crisis.  The Annan plan, if fully implemented, offers the template for achieving this.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work steadfastly in support of this aim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister has said but I still think a country that abuses children in the manner in which these poor Syrian children are being abused deserves a great deal more action.  Syria is not a Third World country where, perhaps, a lack of education and democratic structures might excuse such behaviour.  Syria is a leading light in the Arab League and is a modern example of a well structured society.  This behaviour towards children is simply unacceptable from such an advanced nation.  It appears the UN&rsquo;s appeals are falling on deaf ears, so it is up to Ireland and the EU to do something about this.  Europe and the EU should impose whatever sanctions it can.</P>
        <P>I welcome relations with Russia as the Russian influence in this situation could bring about some control.  However, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l referred to the attack helicopters being ordered from Russia by Syria.  It will be a new low if these helicopters are going to be used to shoot children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to know where we should go with this crisis.  If what is reported in respect of Russia providing additional arms to this monstrous regime is true, it is an affront to international law.  The members of the EU, led by the T&aacute;naiste, must directly confront the Russian President and Government on that action.  It is reprehensible, at the very least, that arms would be provided in a situation where they are being directed at children and women.  In fact, there are reports that children are being strapped to armoured tanks.  This repulses everybody who is right thinking and has a commitment to human rights and common decency.</P>
        <P>In terms of the strategic and diplomatic approach that must be adopted to this, I agree it would probably be unwise to contemplate military intervention at this stage.  Diplomacy must continue, but far greater support must be given to Mr. Annan for the implementation of his six-point plan.  The EU, UN and the Arab League must work far more closely to forcefully support that plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their supplementary contributions.  It is certainly an extraordinarily frustrating situation.  Virtually the entire world is pleading for a resolution to this matter.  It is a savage civil war.  More than 10,000 lives have already been lost and children appear to have been very much to the fore in suffering from the savage acts that have occurred.  There are huge ethnic and religious divisions in the country so military intervention is a difficult measure to contemplate in such circumstances.  It could very well add fuel to the fire.  The only plan in town, so to speak, is the Kofi Annan plan, which has the support of the United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League.  Almost all countries support it.  Clearly, there are problems with Russia and China, and Russia is the country with most influence in that respect.  The rumours that Russia is providing attack helicopters are still not substantiated but it would be a serious escalation if that is the case.</P>
        <P>The European Union has been involved in imposing quite substantial sanctions relating to oil imports, arms sales, freezing of assets and a ban on luxury items, which are very much prized by the Assad family.  UN sanctions are now being imposed and we support that.  We would support any intensification of sanctions.  The T&aacute;naiste has been to the fore in arguing the case at the EU, the OSCE and at the UN, and will continue to do that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter and I thank the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, for being present to respond.  I wrote to the Minister last evening and now we have the opportunity to share our thoughts on the very distressing situation now presenting in Castleblayney, a town that suffered recent significant job losses with the closure of the Cargill Integra plant, a meat processing facility in the town, where 70 jobs were lost.</P>
        <P>On Monday, it emerged that Musgrave, the supplier to the SuperValu store in Castleblayney and despite the fact that it was engaged in direct negotiations with the owner, Mr. Jim McConnon, and his accountant over some time previously, proceeded unilaterally and sought the appointment of a temporary liquidator through the High Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the consequence of that is devastating for Mr. McConnon and his family, the closure also was devastating for the 40 full-time and 15 part-time workers in this significant store located in this relatively small Border community.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good office, as well as that of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to engage directly with the Musgrave Group in Cork and to impress on it the importance of resuming their engagement with the owner.  That negotiation was against the positive development of the securing by Mr. McConnon of certainty of tenure as a result of a previous protracted negotiation with the bank and others.  On that basis, Mr. McConnon believed there was indeed a workable way forward that would have both protected his business and importantly, and a priority in my view, would have protected the employment of the approximately 55 people who now find themselves numbered among the unemployed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister is in a position to outline to Members what steps he has undertaken or intends to undertake.  It is of huge importance that negotiations which were understood to be proceeding in good faith would not be undermined by duplicitous action whereby on the one part, there is an engagement and on the other, one of the parties is preparing literally to pull the carpet from underneath the other.  This is the position that presented in this case last Monday.  Mr. McConnon and his colleague had travelled to Dublin for what was, they believed, a continuum of an engagement that had been taking place over a preceding period.  Simultaneously, however, Musgraves were before the High Court and an army of approximately 30 redshirted employees of that group were <i>en route</i> to Castleblayney to carry out a stock take.  This is not the way to conduct a mutual relationship.  What is involved here is a highly serious matter in respect of procedure, disposition and attitude.  Whatever about the issues and difficulties at its core, there must be some sense of straightforwardness and appreciation of what is involved in the round.  People should not take decisions unilaterally that will have such devastating consequences.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s office and Department will impress this point on the principal in this instance, namely, the Musgrave Group as the suppliers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and note Deputy Conlan also has raised concerns with me about this matter.  I am really disappointed to hear of any job losses and am highly conscious of the effect those losses will have on the individuals concerned.  I certainly wish to assure people the State agencies will be available to support people in any way they can.  As for the substance of the business case, obviously there are legal processes in train in this regard in which the parties involved have proceeded to the courts.  The issues are under the supervision of the courts and the scope for intervention is extremely limited.  This is not a company supported by the agencies and consequently, my Department does not have the sort of relationship that would be involved with other firms.  It appears as though a business decision has been taken by the supplier in respect of this outlet but clearly, I am not privy to the details of that decision.  I cannot set myself up as arbiter of business decisions of this nature.  The supplier has approached the courts, as is its entitlement under the law, and I must respect that.</P>
        <P>I, of course, will seek to offer support in any way I can.  If issues of industrial relations arise, I will use the offices I have available to me, including the agencies that are experienced in dealing with such issues, if scope exists in this regard.  As for workers&rsquo; positions, if it is not possible from the liquidation to find a basis for continued trading in some form, the offices of F&Aacute;S, the State training agencies and the county enterprise boards will be available to support workers, should they seek to start a new business or to retrain.  In respect of access to statutory entitlements, the insolvency payment scheme established under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 provides for payment of certain entitlements owed to employees by their employer at the time of liquidation.  These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, minimum notice and pension contributions.  Claims in respect of such entitlements under the insolvency payment scheme can be processed if a company is insolvent within the definition of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 and a relevant officer, normally a receiver or a liquidator, has been appointed and certifies the claims.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the protection of employees and associated regulations is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 contains a number of provisions regarding information and consultation that must be entered into before collective redundancies can be implemented, including the provision of information regarding employees to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 make it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to engage in an information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the 30-day minimum employee information and consultation period.  Where a liquidator has been appointed to a company, he or she takes on the responsibilities of the employer.  There also are procedures in the event of disputes about the honouring of such obligations and the right to refer a case to a rights commissioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate these are early hours following on this dreadful announcement.  I have corresponded directly with the Musgrave Group and received a response from that company today to my written appeal sent yesterday.  I have it to say it has offered nothing and has guaranteed nothing.  However, Musgrave has of course sought to recruit my support of calls for an end to the workers&rsquo; protest at the now-closed store.  That is about the sum total of what Musgrave has had to say.  I fully understand the great upset and frustration of the significant workforce in this retail outlet.  My purpose in raising this matter with the Minister is to make an appeal to him, whatever the restrictions or difficulties and whatever the limited opportunities that may be open to him, that he and his office should engage directly with Musgrave.  I believe it would have been a better course had Musgrave not sought the appointment of a liquidator with all that that entails but perhaps had sought the appointment of a receiver instead, who I believe would have ensured, at least for a time, the ongoing conduct of the business at that particular location.  Consequently, over time, with the opportunity to elaborate further in respect of the engagement that had been ongoing between Mr. McConnon and Musgrave, a resolution could have been arrived at.  I acknowledge it is not within the Minister&rsquo;s gift to turn around the position but his support would be greatly appreciated.</P>
        <P>I believe I have had a cursory outline by the owner of the business of the status and the intent of that engagement.  He certainly is convinced there was a workable way forward.  I am of the view that he has contended with great difficulties over recent years and has managed to hold his position and to survive and is on a most definite course to ensure the continuation of his business and the great employment it has given.  Moreover, I believe he is absolutely deserving of every support from the State apparatus.  I again use this limited opportunity, for which I am grateful, to urge the Minister&rsquo;s engagement directly with Musgrave.  I believe it can pull back from the brink at this stage and a very sad scenario can be set aside and a brighter prospect put in place on the main street of Castleblayney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the scale of the shock involved but I must be honest and admit I do not know the detailed business background.  I reiterate that this business does not come under my agencies and would not be eligible for State support in any form because of its nature.  The liquidator acts under the guidance of the court which provides a forum whereby the working out of the issues between the sides is conducted under the same guidance.  That should provide fairness in protecting the interests of those concerned.</P>
        <P>I do not know the extent to which a liquidator can retrieve a business from a situation such as happened here.  That is the duty of the court overseeing process, to see what can be found from this and if a fresh business can be found, to discover the state of play in terms of assets and liabilities and the viability of the underlying business.  That is the process which is now in train under the guidance of the court and I do not have a direct role in it, that being the constraint on my office.  If and where workers raise issues concerned with employment rights and areas where we have legal responsibility, or if our agencies can offer support in industrial relations issues that might be sorted, we would be more than happy to act.  However, this case has only come to my notice as of now and I do not have the levers to deal with issues concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter which is of deep concern to me and to many in Waterford, which is designated a gateway city under the national spatial strategy.  It should also be of concern to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who is from Limerick city.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy was published in 2002 to be a blueprint for economic and social development within the State over the following 20 years.  It is very appropriate to have a study such as the recent report from NUI Maynooth presented midway through the full term of the national spatial strategy, NSS, now that ten years have passed.  Balanced regional development requires that the full potential of each region should contribute to the overall performance of the State and be developed on a sustainable, economic, social and environmental basis.  In itself, that sets the framework of the NSS.  Balanced regional development should be the objective of any Government in order to ensure that all our citizens, no matter what region or county they come from, have access to sustainable living.</P>
        <P>The NUI Maynooth economic report to the ESRI conference has identified failures of the national spatial strategy in terms of job creation and the attraction of foreign direct investment into the two gateway cities, Limerick and Waterford.  I wish to speak specifically on Waterford as a gateway, being a Deputy from that constituency.  In the period since 2002, more than 80% of the jobs created by new foreign firms have been created in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway.  This means a very small percentage of new jobs have been created in Limerick and Waterford.  We must ask why this failure is happening within a national plan.  It highlights and confirms concerns that we in Waterford and the south east have had for some time about the region not getting due attention and investment as planned under the NSS.</P>
        <P>The current unemployment figure for Waterford is 20%, considerably above the national average.  This should cause great concern for the Government and for Deputies of any party.  It proves that balanced regional development under the existing national spatial strategy is not working.  If we look at this across a number of sectors, the same is reflected not only in foreign direct investment, but in the delivery of policy and public services.  To take education, the south east is the only region in the country that does not have a university.  I welcome that the programme for Government identifies a technological university for the south east is planned.  I urge all Ministers to progress this so that we can redress the imbalance that has been identified.</P>
        <P>In addition, I refer to the VEC headquarters for the region.  Given that there is consolidation because of fewer resources, why have these headquarters been located out of Waterford, the gateway city, to Wexford, which is a hub?  That is just the educational sector.  In health care Waterford Regional Hospital caters for more than 500,000 people in the region but the south east is the only region without palliative care facilities.  Why is that?  Why has the delivery of Government policy failed to bring regional services for our citizens in the south east?  It is obvious that palliative care should be provided for citizens in Waterford Regional Hospital.  The CAT lab facilities are an example of modern facilities developed in WRH for early intervention for people who suffer heart attacks but it is only a part-time service, not a 24-7 service similar to that in other regional hospitals.  Again, the question needs to be asked.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy is failing some of our gateway cities and regions.  It is high time the Government reviewed this strategy with a view to ensuring proper, balanced, regional development in those areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Coffey&rsquo;s concern and thank him for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The aims of the national spatial strategy include achieving a better balance of social, economic and physical development between regions through the co-ordinated development of nine gateway cities and towns, including Waterford and Limerick, and nine hub towns, together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions.</P>
        <P>The emerging research, which is timely and which I very much welcome, clearly confirms that some of the NSS gateways and their wider regions are performing well albeit in regard to an individual but very important indicator of employment.  National recovery depends on individual regional contributions so the performance of gateways such as Dublin and others must be welcomed.  However, the research confirms previous work by my Department, in conjunction with the two regional assemblies in 2009, in developing a gateway development index.  This index showed that some of the other larger gateways, in particular Limerick-Shannon and Waterford, are not performing to their full potential.  This is adversely affecting the performance of their wider regions.  The challenge for gateways that are not performing to their full potential is to look to the success factors driving stronger gateways and replicate those conditions in their own areas.  Long-term planning frameworks such as the NSS are important, but they need to be monitored continually to ensure they reflect wider economic and social circumstances.</P>
        <P>The conclusions of the 2009 gateway development index fed into the NSS Update and Outlook Report, which was published in October 2010.  My Department continues to work with other Departments and agencies and the local government sector in advancing actions identified in the report under the headings of: better alignment and prioritisation of scarce infrastructura investment; improved governance at national, regional and local levels; and the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, in both rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies.</P>
        <P>Much good work has been completed already.  Through the adoption of updated regional planning guidelines and the introduction of core strategies in city and county development plans, the Government is taking real steps to prioritise the development of the gateways in a way that previous Administrations did not.  The capital review will allow many good projects to progress in a co-ordinated fashion in many of the gateways, including housing regeneration projects, investment in schools and research and innovation capacity, water services and local transport initiatives.</P>
        <P>With regard to the particular focus in the report on foreign direct investment, the Government is acutely aware that such investment is a major source of employment in Ireland, providing some 240,000 jobs, in both direct and indirect employment.  In this regard, the IDA Horizon 2020 presents Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for attracting investors into Ireland and for investing companies and the economy to benefit mutually from the relationship.   It is important to recognise that the IDA Ireland strategy is strongly aligned with the national spatial strategy.  For example, the fourth of the ten steps to transformation in the strategy aims to encourage 50% of foreign direct investment projects to take place in regional gateways outside Dublin and Cork, obviously including Waterford and Limerick.  In that regard and taking up the governance theme that was referred to in the national spatial strategy update and outlook report, I should mention that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is finalising a comprehensive policy statement on local government that will address local government structures at regional, county and sub-county levels, their powers and functions and other matters.  Steps have also been taken to rationalise local government structures in Limerick.  The initiatives I have mentioned will ensure spatial planning supports and facilitates investment and development in the right place at the right time.  I acknowledge that Deputy Coffey spoke about the high level of unemployment in Waterford, in particular.  He also raised issues of health and education.  I will convey his remarks to the relevant Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Deputy Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I appreciate that planning now falls under her remit.  It is important for the national spatial strategy to be continually reviewed and updated.  I am glad the Government acknowledges that there have been failures and that imbalances need to be addressed.  Employment is one of the most important indices for any region.  As the gateway city for the south-east region, it is essential for Waterford to be prioritised by the Government.  There should be a cross-cutting departmental response to the challenges that lie ahead.  I have no doubt that the Government will do everything in its power to address those imbalances.  If it does not, the south east region will sink further and fall further behind.  Time is not on our side.  I again thank the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my initial response, I mentioned that one of the aims of the IDA Ireland strategy is for 50% of foreign direct investment projects to be located in regional gateways outside Dublin and Cork.  As a Government, we need to continue to drive this approach, which clearly has a great deal of potential for Waterford and Limerick.  I agree that there is a need to continuously review and update our responses to the national spatial strategy to ensure there is a focus on areas that are not performing as well as some other areas.  As I have said, I empathise with Deputy Coffey&rsquo;s feelings with regard to Waterford because many of the same problems are being experienced in my own city of Limerick.  I will follow up on this issue with my Government colleagues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this topical matter, which is very pertinent to our capital city.  The Minister of State will agree that the privatisation of the refuse service that has taken place in Dublin has been an exemplary case study in how not to transfer a service from the public sector to the private sector.  A great deal of uncertainty has evolved as part of the fall-out from the transition process.</P>
        <P>I will set out where it all began to go wrong.  When the initial decision was taken, the members of Dublin City Council were not consulted in any shape or fashion.  They were told that a decision had been taken and given a week&rsquo;s notice of the privatisation of the service.  It is deplorable that local public representatives who were democratically elected in the Dublin City Council administrative area were not given more than a week&rsquo;s notice of such a major decision.  The Fianna F&aacute;il group on the council called an emergency meeting, with the support of the Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors who control the council but it did not get any degree of satisfaction in this respect.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough that the private service provider, Greyhound, is not providing the level of refuse service that was formerly provided by Dublin City Council.  Bins are not being collected on the designated day.  Bins are being collected at irregular hours of the day and night.  The service is wholly inadequate.  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, is in attendance.  Her senior colleague in Dublin City Council&rsquo;s parent Department &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Hogan &mdash; should have ensured there was a seamless transition when an important service like refuse collection was the subject of such a major change.</P>
        <P>The contract that was agreed between Dublin City Council and Greyhound is shrouded in secrecy and confidentiality.  Dublin City Council has form in this regard.  We are familiar with the issues that have developed with Covanta in the case of the proposed Poolbeg incinerator at Ringsend.  We have been told that commercial sensitivities and issues of confidentiality are at stake.  That is not good enough, given that section 136 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that if councillors pass a resolution looking for information, as was the case in this instance, it is incumbent on the management and the executive of the council to put that information into the public domain.</P>
        <P>Approximately 40,000 people currently benefit from refuse waivers.  I understand the waivers will run out at some stage.  What will happen to those people when their waivers expire?  I suggest we will have a major litter problem in Dublin.  The only response we have seen from Dublin City Council to date has been to remove many of its bins from public areas, on the basis that they are being stuffed with domestic refuse.  That is the wrong way of dealing with the issue.  A growing litter problem could have a negative impact on tourism and this country&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, for example.</P>
        <P>The issue of the upfront payment has been partially resolved.  Issues with upfront payments arose in other administrative areas after companies developed commercial difficulties.  I suggest that a bond system should be used.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, should consider asking these companies to put in place a bond in case issues arise with regard to people who have made upfront payments.</P>
        <P>I will not speak at length about the service level agreement because I do not have enough time.  If Dublin City Council were to publish the service level agreement it arrived at with Greyhound during the negotiations, it would be informative for the public.  What is the up-to-date position in the Department on this issue?  Where will those who currently have waivers, many of whom are old age pensioners who are having to deal with issues like the household charge, stand when their waivers run out?  Will Dublin City Council put in place a plan to assist the approximately 40,000 people who hold waivers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Collins for raising this issue.  As I have said previously, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will announce the Government&rsquo;s local government reform plan in the near future.  I mention that in response to what the Deputy said at the outset about the role of elected representatives when a decision was made in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council withdrew from the provision of household waste collection services in January 2012 and sold that business to a private sector waste management firm.  The council&rsquo;s withdrawal from the household waste collection market brings the council into line with the position elsewhere in the Dublin waste management region, given that Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have previously withdrawn from the market.  The situation in the Dublin region is representative of the national position, in so far as very few local authorities continue to provide household waste collection services.  A current estimate of the local authority share of the national household waste collection market is less than 5%, with the private sector having the remaining 95% share.</P>
        <P>Any queries concerning a local authority&rsquo;s withdrawal from the market and the transitional agreements between that authority and a private sector waste management firm are matters for the relevant local authority.  Similarly, questions on a local authority&rsquo;s motivation for exiting the household waste collection market should be put to that authority.  I am sure Deputy Collins&rsquo;s party colleagues on the council are well able to do that.  The general trend of local authorities withdrawing from direct provision of household waste collection services has resulted in comments about the respective roles of the public and private sectors.  From a typical householder&rsquo;s perspective, such issues are often largely immaterial.  What matters is that a quality affordable service, which meets their needs and delivers on society&rsquo;s environmental and other preferences, is provided.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that waste management issues are frequently raised as matters of concern in this House.  In recent months, we have discussed a wide variety of such issues, including the withdrawal of almost all local authorities from household waste collection, service standards, segregation of waste, regulatory control, breaches of environmental law, pricing structures, the future of the household waste collection industry, waivers for low income households and the role of elected members in formulating waste policy.  Deputy Collins mentioned the question of waivers, for example.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I welcome the engagement of this House with such issues.  Many of the issues raised relate to the enforcement of waste management legislation, whether that enforcement activity is directed at householders, the business community or the waste management industry.  In that context, the withdrawal of local authorities from direct service provision creates an opportunity for them to refocus on their regulatory role, in particular the enforcement of waste management legislation.</P>
        <P>Both the EPA and local authorities are charged with ensuring, through rigorous enforcement activity, that waste is managed legally and appropriately throughout the chain of waste management, from presentation to collection, processing and the recycling, recovery or disposal of that waste.  Any entity which breaks the law should be sanctioned appropriately.</P>
        <P>I note that some of the concerns raised by Deputy Collins need to be directed to Dublin City Council.  I will respond in so far as I can to any other issues he has raised and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant body of households are dependent on the refuse waiver in Dublin city at present but there is a wider policy dimension throughout the country in regard to refuse waivers per se because there are different policies in different electoral areas.  It is high time we had a national policy in regard to the provision of refuse waivers.  Clearly, the policy of the State is to withdraw itself from the refuse collection business and to subcontract it out to the private sector.  That being the case, there is a pressing need in this regard.  There is an overlap between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection in potentially devising a national policy for a national refuse waiver.  With regard to Dublin, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could use her good offices to find out and reply to me on what will be the position of the approximately 40,000 refuse waiver holders in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said this is an issue for Dublin City Council, and I understand her point.  However, there is a wider social issue in regard to the litter problem that exists in parts of Dublin.  There are 18,000 households in Dublin which are at present not registered for refuse collection.  The Minister of State might comment on where stands that issue.  As I said, there are wider issues.  We have the EU Presidency coming up and we want to put our best foot forward.  Dublin is the capital of the country and a major tourism hub and destination.  Image is very important in terms of tourism.  When we have a significant number of households that are not registered for collection, where is the waste going?  The answer is obvious.  It is a significant issue of public interest.  Dublin City Council management is not giving sufficient answers to the questions outlined.  The Minister of State can say it is an issue for Dublin City Council but there is a wider public dimension to it, which is why it must be raised here.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise what is a very important issue for Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it is a very important issue.  If I can get answers to those questions, I will come back to the Deputy.  The approach to the future regulation of the household waste collection market in Dublin and elsewhere will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of economic, environmental and other relevant issues &mdash; the Deputy has just raised the issue around the 18,000 who are not registered &mdash; and the many perspectives being offered by the people being consulted.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Hogan, expects to be in a position to submit final proposals in regard to household waste collection to Government in the coming weeks as a part of a new national waste policy, which is part of a commitment that has been given.  Deputy Collins has raised legitimate concerns.  A transition such as this raises significant issues and we acknowledge there are issues to be addressed.  If there is further information we can get from the Department I will forward that to the Deputy.  However, I suspect some of the questions need to be directed to Dublin City Council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
	<P>Our economy is one of the most open in the world, a fact that has both negative and positive aspects.  An open economy is more vulnerable to international economic events and shocks which leave indigenous companies and businesses more exposed and thus constrain the intended effects of economic decisions taken by the State.  However, the positive effects of an open economy where innovation, enterprise and investment are encouraged far outweigh the negatives.</P>
        <P>A recent National Irish Bank-<i>Financial Times</i> foreign direct investment monitor ranked Ireland as the second most attractive country globally for foreign direct investment.  It is worth noting that over 1,000 overseas companies support 146,000 jobs, generating &euro;110 billion in exports, which directly benefits the Exchequer.  The figures clearly demonstrate that foreign direct investment plays a crucial role in stimulating economic development here and, along with the clustering effect, promotes innovation and entrepreneurship among indigenous companies.  It is some achievement for a country of our size to note that eight of the world&rsquo;s top ten ICT companies are here along with nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies and 17 of the top 25 medical device companies.</P>
        <P>Overseas companies play a very significant role in my constituency of Galway West.  The Government, working with the IDA and the chamber of commerce in Galway, among others, has so far this year helped to attract 750 new multinational sector jobs, with hundreds more indigenously created jobs and spin-off jobs.  I spoke recently with the senior manager of a multinational company in Galway, an Irishman who, like so many thousands of others, has benefited from the sector&rsquo;s progress and development in the West.  It was his contention that, in the event of a conflict between Irish law and business practices or the wishes of a multinational company, it is Irish law that should be changed.  As I believe in the legislative functions of the Oireachtas on behalf of the Irish people, I disagreed respectfully, but it does raise an important concept.  The ability to make law must always rest with representatives of the people acting for the good of all citizens and the nation.  However, that must not preclude us from having a common sense approach in creating a business-friendly environment which is conducive to job retention and creation.</P>
        <P>On top of the commitments to aid economic recovery and employment creation contained in the programme for Government, the Taoiseach has set this country an ambitious target to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016.  Given the impact of foreign direct investment on our economy, implementing measures to make it easier to invest, conduct business and create jobs is central to achieving the target.  The 2012 jobs action plan is one such measure.  This document is a culmination of a new approach in delivering success by identifying not just the desired goals for job creation but also those groups, Departments or organisations responsible for achieving these goals.  It also identifies a plan of action for further building on the success of the multinational sector.  Multinationals invest in Ireland for many reasons, including our talented workforce, geographical position, competitive corporation tax rate and uncomplicated, straightforward business regulatory system.  Revenue is one organisation which has gone to great lengths with online and IT support systems to make it easier for businesses to pay taxes and charges such as VAT and so forth.</P>
        <P>This legislation forms part of this uncomplicated pro-investment and pro-jobs approach.  By extending acceptance of international accounting principles we are simplifying regulations but not diminishing the strength and spirit of the underlying provisions of the various Companies Acts.  Furthermore, the specific extension of the acceptance of US-GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, will benefit the some 550 US companies with operations across our country.  The Bill will also benefit companies whose securities are registered with, or which report to, the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</P>
        <P>With this legislation, the Government is ensuring red tape and bureaucracy is kept to a minimum.  Accepting the international accountancy practices will further entice and attract multinationals from across the world to Ireland, including to Galway West.  This in turn promotes investment and innovation and brings the benefits of employment to both citizens and the State.  Indigenous companies also benefit from new contracts and networks, which can lead to new business.  The clustering effect which multinationals bring greatly assists in the establishment of indigenous start-ups which spot opportunities either to complement or compete with the newly attracted companies.  Ultimately, there is no single cure for our unemployment problem.  We need a series of measures, this legislation included, which are well thought out and carefully constructed and complemented by clear points of responsibility which will get our people back to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill proposes a number of focused changes to company law in the interest of maintaining a flexible operating environment, particularly for companies that bring foreign direct investment to Ireland.  The Bill amends the provisions of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which permits the use of US accounting standards &mdash; referred to in the Bill as US GAAP &mdash; in the preparation of the accounts of a specified category of company, and allows for the prescription of the use of other internationally recognised accounting standards.  Without changing eligibility criteria, the Bill extends both the timescales relating to the availability for use of US accounting standards and the period for which an individual company can avail of this provision.  There was already a sunset clause and a maximum period companies could use, both of which are being amended.  The Bill also correspondingly extends the periods in respect of the provision in that Act for the prescription of other internationally recognised accounting standards.</P>
        <P>These measures can be seen in the context of the Government&rsquo;s policy of encouragement and facilitation of foreign direct investment.  The importance of foreign direct investment to the economy remains highly significant.  FDI accounts for a total of 250,000 jobs, one in every seven, in Ireland.  The immediate outlook for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign investment portfolio is exceptionally good.  To date in 2012, there have been 25 investment announcements, with the potential to create more than 4,000 jobs.  It is encouraging to note that notwithstanding the economic downturn, Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment and that so many companies are prepared to undertake and announce these investments in Ireland.  Foreign direct investment has a major role to play in the current situation where Ireland is in the process of emerging from a period of unprecedented financial turbulence and where critical stages in that process still lie ahead.  The Government has operated on a wide variety of fronts in addressing the task of repairing our economy and restoring our international reputation.  We are engaging with our European colleagues, the United States and many other countries to demonstrate that Ireland is squaring up to its economic difficulties and has the intent, resolve and imagination to overcome them.</P>
        <P>As a member of the European Union, Ireland offers international investors a stable political and economic environment and a sophisticated and well developed corporate, legal and regulatory environment.  The quality of our economic regulation is a significant factor in our competitiveness and growth.  It is critical, therefore, that we have the capacity to respond to economic circumstances as they unfold in a way that is both strategic and reflects the evolving needs of business and investors.  Those companies with a presence in Ireland and availing of the US GAAP facility under the  2009 Act provide significant employment here which this Bill should help to consolidate, with the possibility of further jobs being created, particularly if the economic situation in export markets picks up over time.  Those companies are involved across of range of industry sectors, including health care, technology and services.</P>
        <P>In my constituency of Dublin North-East, an announcement was made in April of 280 new jobs in Baldoyle with Mylan Inc, a key member of the Irish pharmaceutical sector providing high quality generic pharmaceuticals and over the counter medicines around the world.  This was a very welcome announcement for Baldoyle and Dublin.  It is a further sign that Ireland is attractive as a location for investment and serves to demonstrate why legislation such as this is important.  At a time when unemployment is at very high levels, the Mylan and other announcements from US companies such as Amgen, Apple, Twitter and Paypal, show that Ireland is able to entice investment and to create jobs along with that investment.  Jobs and investment are the only way our economy will ever recover properly.  This legislation serves to show multinational companies that Ireland is a good place in which to do business.</P>
        <P>I understand that the new Bill will run to over 2,000 sections, will consolidate existing Irish company legislation dating back to 1963 and will introduce several reforms.  The Bill will consolidate the existing 15 Companies Acts &mdash; 16 when the Bill currently before the House becomes law &mdash; dating from 1963 as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies into a single Act which is expected to comprise 1,400 sections.  Parts 1 to 15 of the Bill contain all of the laws relating to the most common company type in Ireland, the private company limited by shares.</P>
        <P>In summary, the provisions of the Bill cover the incorporation of companies, corporate governance, sureties for directors and secretaries, financial statements and auditors, receivers, reorganisations, examinerships, wind-ups, compliance and enforcement.  These provisions are brought together in a coherent structure which will facilitate business people in incorporating and operating companies on a day to day basis.</P>

	<P>I welcome this Bill.  We must all agree that any Bill referring to company law is hugely important in any economy at any time, but anything that refers to company law in this economy and to the need to encourage foreign direct investment is of special importance.</P>
        <P>At a time of so much instability and negativity, it is hugely supportive of the economy to see people interested in investing here who put their money where their mouths are and invest in the economy and create jobs.  While we should not become slaves to this, we need to be able to attract foreign direct investment and to be able to demonstrate to those viewing us from outside that we are attractive to investors.  We must also recognise the need to have ongoing investment in manufacturing, services and the financial sector, thereby enlarging our economy in the competitive, global market that exists currently.  Deputy Ross mentioned that he had some reservations with regard to the possibility of a financial transaction tax being imposed by some other European countries and the impact this would have.  I agree.  It goes without saying that no European country will indulge in a financial transaction tax unless it is globally acceptable, because any country becoming part of such a system would find itself isolated and vulnerable.  The financial services sector in this country would be hugely vulnerable, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those countries that would not sign up to such a proposal.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>In general, it is with regard to the application of company law in the main companies that I look forward to this Bill coming before this House.  As I have mentioned many times, I believe there has been a flagrant cavalier attitude to company law in this country, and others, over the past number of years.  If adequate regard was had for company law, we would not be in the economic situation we are in, or at least not to the same extent as we are.  As one of those who participated in the sub-committee dealing with the 1990 Act, the last major visit we had to company law, I believe we need the consolidation Bill before the House as a matter of urgency.  I am aware there are thousands of sections in the Bill, but so be it.  In order to be able to work in an environment that is competitive nationally and internationally, it is of huge importance that those involved in companies and investment &mdash; those investing now and those likely to invest in the future &mdash; can be certain they do so in an environment wherein everybody refers to the same rule of play, the same ground rules and the same level playing pitch.</P>
      
        <P>Even a superficial appraisal of what happened with some major players in this country over the past ten or 15 years would give one a jaundiced view of what was happening with regard to good fiduciary practice, good governance, annual reviews, independent audits, auditors&rsquo; reports and their implementation, DIRT, and the reforms that were supposedly put into place during that period.  Why were these never implemented?  Why has every recommendation on company law in the past ten or 15 years been ignored?  As a result of a lack of implementation of those basic principles of company law, many people are now out of work.  Many in our society are paying the price for those who avoided company law to the extent of being cavalier.</P>
        <P>While I welcome this Bill, which is to facilitate foreign direct investment &mdash; which we all support &mdash; I must point out that major consolidation legislation is eagerly awaited and badly needed, and should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>There is a tendency in this country to be suspicious of foreign direct investment.  There are some in the House who regularly state that people would not invest here if it were not to make a profit.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle: what other reason is there for investment?  Does anybody invest for loss?  I have never heard of such a thing in my life.  If anybody is suggesting that people would invest for loss or for another purpose, I would like an example, because no one has ever brought such a thing to my attention.  To those who say in a critical fashion that people invest here only for profit, I say of course they do.  That is what everything is about.  It is what keeps the economy turning over.</P>
        <P>There are also those who have been critical in the past of foreign direct investors, accusing them of repatriating their profits.  What do such people suggest investors do &mdash; distribute their profits through charitable donations to the country in general?  I have never heard such nonsense in my life.  There is no reason people invest except to make a profit and to contribute to society and to social evolution.</P>
        <P>We welcome the Bill as it is, and we fully accept what it proposes to do.  Incidentally, in my constituency we have long had a positive attitude towards foreign direct investors, and their numbers prove it.  We welcomed investors in a similar economic climate to the one in which we are living now, when many wise people were suggesting we should not go down that road but should take a different route involving the setting up of different types of industry which would supposedly be more effective.  They were wrong.  We commend those companies that have set up here, including Intel, Hewlett Packard and various companies in the pharmaceutical and medical sector.  That is the approach we must take in the first instance.  On the back of that investment, we must be prepared to encourage other industries to locate here and provide employment in order to maximise the economic impact and utilise all possible opportunities for increasing the size of our economy in the future.</P>
        <P>I have long been of the view that we must protect and promote the manufacturing sector.  Over the past number of years there has been a theory in this country that we should forget about manufacturing and invest everything in technology.  That is a good idea; technological items must be manufactured as well.  However, we should never forget that once we become uncompetitive, for whatever reason, in the manufacturing sector, it automatically follows that the same situation occurs in the services sector and, ultimately, our entire economy is affected.  Over the past ten or 15 years, manufacturing companies have left this country and gone to adjoining jurisdictions.  That should not be happening.  We need to ask ourselves, seriously, what the reason is.  I have a fairly good idea what some of the reasons are, but I will not go into them this evening, the Ceann Comhairle will be glad to hear.  However, we need to focus on this, because every economy depends on competitiveness &mdash; how we compare with those in the same market as ourselves.  As public representatives we should do all in our power to ensure we are constructive and that, particularly in the present climate, we are positive in encouraging those who want to invest here.</P>
        <P>We do not want to see a repeat of some of the things we have witnessed over the past 20 years with regard to the application of company law, such as companies being used as investment houses for the benefit of those seeking to make a quick buck and walk away afterwards.  We do not want that in the future and we do not want to give the impression that it is in any way acceptable in this country.</P>

	<P>I too am delighted to speak on this Bill.  I know how important foreign direct investment is, and has been over the decades, to our economy.  I want to mention my own constituency in this regard, because in south Tipperary and a small part of west Waterford alone there are many foreign-owned companies &mdash; mostly American &mdash; including Boston Scientific, Merck and Abbott, although we have also had some that were not so successful.  They are doing tremendous work and providing a lot of employment.  Many of those employed are in highly technical positions with good wages, but there are low-skilled jobs as well, so there is variety.  There are close to 4,000 people employed in such industries, so I know how important they are.  I also know the importance of good employers.  I have been hearing warnings about our graduates for a number of years at conferences and in speeches given by industrialists, especially Americans.  There was a blunt warning recently at the residence of the American ambassador, Dan Rooney, in the Phoenix Park.  The message is that we are unfortunately falling behind in producing the types of graduates that are required by investors &mdash; that is, graduates in maths and science, including biology.  It is a pity.  The company representatives stated that sometimes when they are locating in Ireland they must bring graduates with them or recruit them from other European countries.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  I am straying from the point, but we must be cognisant of this issue.  I listened to some reports this morning about universities and the debate about people going into universities and having to be retrained.  We need to examine the whole system from secondary school onwards and consider where we are going.</P>
        <P>This legislation is important, and I welcome its introduction.  I support it, but it makes me more aware of the lack of reaction from our Government and institutions of State in other areas.  When the Americans say &ldquo;Jump&rdquo;, we say &ldquo;How high?&rdquo;.  I do not mean to be cynical &mdash; it is right that this is the case &mdash; but we should be just as responsive to other issues, which I will mention later.</P>
        <P>Some of the jargon in the Bill is very technical.  The eligibility criteria applicable to companies in respect of the use of US generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, are essentially those set out at section 1 of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Beneficiary companies are those whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the EEA, whose securities are registered with or who are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and who are existing eligible beneficiaries under the 2009 Act.  I accept that the 2009 Act went a long way, but obviously it did not go far enough.  It is now 2012 and the Act needs to be amended, so that is the only way to proceed, and it is right and proper to do so.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, there must have been quite a bit of pressure from US companies and others to make these changes.  We cannot say a lot about this.  I can only speak for south Tipperary; I do not have the national figures for foreign direct investment, especially by American companies, but they are huge.  As far as I am concerned they will always be welcome because they are good employers in the main.</P>
        <P>However, I am concerned about the current state of Europe.  Deputy Tom Fleming referred this morning to the difficulty of lifting mercury with a fork.  I am more worried about Chancellor Merkel and her slowness in adopting the treaty.  We voted on it and I complimented the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on their success in getting the referendum passed but the Greeks and the French have yet to cast their votes.  The Germans, who are always wise, delayed their decision.  I fear they are playing a trump card which could be damaging to foreign direct investment in Ireland, namely, the financial transaction tax.  The German Greens, on whom Chancellor Merkel relies for support, are hellbent on introducing this tax.  It would have severe consequences for Ireland, particularly given the favourable treatment that the UK offers to its financial services centre.  London is only a stone&rsquo;s throw away and there will be another flight of the earls as people transfer their operations.  Apart from pharmaceuticals and health care, many American companies with high turnover in Ireland are represented here by no more than the plates on their office doors.  These companies could move to London overnight.  We must be aware of that danger and be forthright in fighting it.</P>
        <P>I know from my limited experience of European countries that some jurisdictions, such as France, levy lower taxes than what multinationals pay in corporation tax here.  Several speakers have referred to perceptions of good or creative accountancy.  Creative accounting allows companies operating in France and elsewhere to pay less tax than the companies which operate in Ireland.  It is a trick of the loop job.  They have been creative with their accounting but we are cast as the bogey boys who are attracting multinationals to the detriment of other countries.  One would imagine we were not in the EU and were on an outlandish island.  We have been good partners in Europe and why should we have to face a sustained attack when other countries close to the heart of Europe grant more generous concessions to foreign direct investment in a less transparent manner?</P>
        <P>Last night Deputy O&rsquo;Dea explained the difference between accounting in the US and Ireland.  He spoke about a company which made significant losses under the US system but enjoyed large profits in Ireland.  It makes me suspicious that creative accounting is being used because our cost base is not that low.  The contrast is extraordinary.  Are we being honest with ourselves and are these people being honest with us?  We have to fight the transaction tax at all costs.</P>
        <P>I accept that the action being taken by the Government is warranted but I contrast it with the lethargic efforts by this Government and its predecessor to deal with the organs of the State which have become too cumbersome and are no longer fit for purpose.  VAT was increased by 2% in the last budget.  The former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan &mdash; God be good to him &mdash; increased VAT by 0.5% in a previous budget but he subsequently reduced it again because it sent the wrong message.  Why did Department of Finance officials not put those figures on the table for discussion?  It was a no-brainer.  If a 0.5% increase in VAT failed in its objectives, a 2% increase was four times as likely to fail.  Businesses have closed as a result of this increase.</P>
        <P>Small and medium enterprises are crying out for support and legislation that will give them a breathing space.  They do not want to break the law or evade taxes but they want to be left alone rather than crucified with the legions who call to their doors on a daily basis with briefcases full of forms.  An employer with six staff would need to hire an additional employee simply to fill in the forms.  We need to change the system to deal with that.  Anywhere we see an indigenous sole trader, an employer who wants to take on one or ten staff, farmers who are running businesses or small shopkeepers, we see people who are paying rates and taxes in order to keep our country afloat through this desperate recession.  They are hanging on without a shilling in credit even though they are suffering like the rest of us to bail out the banks.  I was delighted that John Trethowan announced last week that he recognises the banks are not lending.  They did not lend under their agreement with the previous Minister for Finance and they are still not doing so.  When are they going to be brought to book?  We are losing valuable businesses on a daily basis and many business people are so burnt out that I doubt they will ever have sufficient energy to return to sole trading or employing people.  That is a significant concern because if each of our 300,000 small businesses took on one additional employee, we would all but wipe out the dole queues.  That energy is there to be tapped if we can remove the burden of red tape.  I am starting to sound like a broken record but I have been in that situation and I regularly meet people who are dealing with these problems.</P>
        <P>The Leader companies and county enterprise boards did great work but for some reason they are being amalgamated.  We seem to attack the good things while leaving alone waste, inertia and top heavy Departments of State.  It is my personal belief that we cannot tackle this problem because it is run by a cosy cartel.  These Departments are too powerful.  Today I met two individuals who operate companies in the agricultural sector, one of whom has 25 years of experience and the other 18 years.  They have come under attack from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has decided to sponsor a different company.  The Department provided this company with 75% funding two years ago and 66% this year.  Despite this funding, I was told in a reply to a parliamentary question on the issue that the Department has no responsibility for the company.  The officials gave me that reply but the Minister is supposed to be in charge.  Something serious is going on if they can claim that the company has nothing to do with the Department.  Two viable businesses are being strangled.  Their owners worked alongside the Department for many years and charted a course for information technology in farm businesses.  Now they are being taken over by a wing of the State and cobbled and nobbled.  When we ask parliamentary questions, we are told they have no responsibility for them.  I do not know why the troika is not looking at matters such as this but it should examine it, as should the Minister.  I can provide the Minister with details, D&aacute;il questions, numbers and dates.</P>
        <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may think I am straying from the Bill when I mention the voluntary sector but I am contrasting the need for this Bill with the inertia in dealing with other areas.  I have been involved in the voluntary sector for a number of years and I am a member of seven or eight companies limited by guarantee with articles of understanding and memoranda.  They must have audits and accountability.  I want to refer to the costs associated with that and the impact on the functioning of groups.  Many companies are assisted by community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  They make the rural towns and villages tick.  I cannot understand why there cannot be a template for auditing.  I acknowledge the directors of the company limited by guarantee must be above board and, if they are not, they should not be allowed to continue.  I want to make it easy for them.  Why should they be forced into fund-raising every year for a sum between &euro;1,300 and &euro;2,500 for audit fees?  Another voluntary company next door must pay the same fee.  It is becoming a racket for auditors and the fees are too high.  There must be some way of doing this cheaply.  It is the same with insurance schemes.</P>
        <P>I asked the Minister for Social Protection a question about the review of community employment schemes promised in December.  These people cannot survive because part of the funds they received for materials paid for the audits, paid to keep the doors open and paid for lighting and heating.  Some voluntary groups are big employers.  I am chairman of a voluntary group that employs 16 people.  We do tremendous work in the community and it is acknowledged by all.  We have given countless hours of retraining and upskilling, leading to many people returning to employment and self-employment.  One went into the dying profession of farrier, which is tremendous.  We found those people when they were on the live register.  They were downcast and downbeaten and they thought it was the end of the line but the scheme gave them a new lease of life.  The Minister and the Deputies on the Government side understand this happens in every community.  I am not blowing my own trumpet.</P>
        <P>There will always be 5% of participants who do not return to employment and will be residual on the scheme.  That is natural.  F&Aacute;S did great work locally in contrast to management at the top.  I saw an article in <i>the Irish Independent</i> about the HSE and the scandal involving the F&Aacute;S training budget.  The budget was raped, which is a strong word, and plundered by senior people to fly all over the world.  It was not F&Aacute;S participants, voluntary sponsor groups or local F&Aacute;S officials.  It was the high flyers at the top who hijacked it in the same way the country has been hijacked in every profession and in many Departments by top officials.  These are the same people who got away with the pension levy under the late Brian Lenihan four years ago.  Everyone else paid it but them because the levy was reversed in their case.  It was scandalous.  They are the people with power clasped in their hands, they are in the Minister&rsquo;s way and he cannot do anything without them.  I am not saying anything about the officials in the Chamber because I do not know who they are.  It is the case in every Department, where the officials have more power than any Minister.  If they do not want to act, they will not act.  If they do not want to change, they will not change.</P>
        <P>As we adopt the measures in this Bill to make changes, we are promised reform by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  I wish him well and he is doing okay.  We saw the report today but much more needs to be done.  We must help to nurture these people.  We employ 16 people and the next parish has the same figures, as do many more parishes.  Community employment schemes provide every kind of service, from meals on wheels to community alert and helping in daycare centres.  Participants do work the State has abandoned because it does not have the money.  The State abandoned this work ten years ago and it was happily taken up by voluntary groups, which is good.  Participants are highly trained, reskilled and have undergone Garda vetting but now the scheme is under attack.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is doing her best.</P>
        <P>This morning we saw the case of the ESRI report.  If it does not suit the official Government, it is hijacked and buried.  I am not talking about the Taoiseach because he said this morning that he would not do it and did not do it.  It is the official Government that does not like it because it might expose them.  Some people are much better off unemployed than they would be working.  I am a small employer and I have been the victim of this.  Unfortunately, I had to put people on a three-day week in the past number of years and I could not get them to come back to work.  I cannot blame them.  The Minister has moved to change the legislation.  With a three-day week, one gets three days work from the employer and three days from the State.  That automatically puts one eight hours ahead of the person working full-time.</P>
        <P>Many areas must be examined and dealt with.  We must get serious because Ministers are doing their best.  I commend the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, who is bringing in foreign direct investment.  It is needed and I understand why this legislation is being passed.  We must act in the same way in other areas of indigenous business to keep it alive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy Paul Connaughton.  I welcome this short and focused Companies (Amendment) Bill, which extends the period by which certain companies can use the US accounting framework rather than the accounting framework used in Ireland.  Generally, the international financial reporting standards, IFRS, system is used in Ireland but this Bill will allow US companies to use the general accepted accounting principles, GAAP, system until the end of 2020.  This was to be phased out by 2015 but there is no global agreement on the accounting rules and how companies in different countries use different rules.  Accordingly, this is being extended.  The Bill will be particularly of interest to US multinationals and the companies they deal with.  It will save time and cost for those who have offices in Ireland.  It will improve efficiency and also Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a location in which the US looks to invest.</P>
        <P>Ireland ranks high in the IMD world competitiveness survey.  It is ranked first for the availability of skilled labour, first for investment incentives and first for the flexibility and adaptability of our workforce.  These are three important areas that should encourage investment in the country.  In 2011, Ireland was ranked second for openness to foreign investors, another reason why we should attract investment.  The strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the stability treaty endorsed the perception of Ireland as a stable country and endorsed the confidence that we are on the road to recovery.  One of the priorities of the IDA is to attract more foreign direct investment to Ireland, as outlined in its strategy documents.</P>
        <P>The US has been an investor in Ireland for a long time.  It believes in the strengths and talents of the Irish workforce.  This country has a good future.  More than 100,000 workers are in US multinational companies and over 50% of foreign direct investment in Ireland has come from the US over the past five years.  One in seven jobs in Ireland comes from foreign direct investment.  This Government is determined to get Ireland back on track and to be numbered among the top five countries for international competitiveness, an ambition which is aided by the low corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</P>
        <P>I refer to the welcome announcements in recent months by US multinational companies.  Hewlett Packard announced 280 jobs in Kildare and in Galway.  PayPal announced the creation of 1,000 jobs in its European, Middle East and Africa customer service headquarters to be based in Dundalk.  Both Eli Lilly and Apple announced that they would each create 500 jobs in Cork.  Mylan is a US multinational pharmaceutical company announced 300 jobs in the Baldoyle industrial estate in my constituency of Dublin North-East and a further 200 jobs in the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley&rsquo;s constituency.  This announcement is much appreciated and welcomed by our constituents.  The chief executive officer of Mylan stated that the availability of a skilled and a highly educated workforce with a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence had encouraged Mylan to make this further investment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We need to have self-belief and be confident that we are taking the right steps to take our country out of recession.  The Taoiseach recently led a trade mission to China and he was accompanied by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  It is hoped this visit will lead to announcements of job creation in the future.  Some contracts and agreements have already been signed and the Government is working to promote and encourage foreign direct investment into Ireland.</P>
        <P>Foreign direct investment generates 70% of corporation tax and it contributes to expenditure of &euro;19 billion in the economy and generates &euro;110 billion in exports.  This investment should be encouraged and the provisions in this Bill will help to make Ireland a more attractive option for international companies to expand and to set up business in Ireland.  It will allow US companies to prepare their Irish accounts using the US GAAP accounting standards and this will create a more efficient system and companies will incur fewer costs.  Any provision that allows for lower costs and less red tape is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>We all want to see further foreign direct investment in Ireland and less bureaucracy for business.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Increasing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the global market place is absolutely essential in order to effect a reversal in the economic fortunes of the country.  As more countries experience recession, the task of securing foreign direct investment becomes even more difficult.  It is imperative that Ireland builds on its many advantages for foreign companies seeking a European base by ensuring that its company law is as streamlined and as easy to navigate as possible.</P>
        <P>The amendments contained in this Bill seek to extend the period of time in which certain Irish incorporated companies can prepare and file their accounts under an accounting framework that applies in the USA, from the end of 2015 to the end of 2020.</P>
        <P>This Government has prioritised the encouragement and facilitation of foreign direct investment and this Bill is one of a raft of measures being undertaken to ensure that the necessary housekeeping is done to smooth the way for companies considering investing here.  Foreign direct investment accounts for one in seven jobs in Ireland, a staggering 250,000 jobs.  What is particularly encouraging is that jobs continue to be created and to date this year, the creation of 4,000 jobs in 25 separate investments has been announced.</P>
        <P>The ability to attract jobs, given the current unprecedented financial turbulence, is particularly commendable  It is often the case that financial uncertainty creates an entrenchment which makes new investment less attractive and so the successes to date are very significant.  However, every Member of this House is only too aware of the significant number of people who are currently unemployed and job creation remains a top priority.  Thus, it is critical that every possible step is taken to ensure that Ireland becomes increasingly competitive in the global market.</P>
        <P>A skilled workforce, attractive tax regime, English language usage and a cohort of multinational companies already based in Ireland, are just some of the attractions, but a pro-business environment is also extremely important and that is what this Bill seeks to effect.  The <i>WorldCompetitiveness Yearbook</i> for 2011, ranked Ireland first in the world for business legislation for foreign investors and the attitude which underlies this first-rate ranking is reflected in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Economic circumstances are changing at a rapid rate.  The ability to adapt quickly and properly to the given circumstances will be critical in the months and years ahead.  The need to meet evolving needs is a key consideration for any nation.  With such a state of flux in world markets, pressure will be maintained to identify new opportunities and to create the conditions necessary to attract investment to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The lack of uniform accounting standards is a constant headache for multinational companies and has also been an issue of international political concern, especially among G20 leaders.  There is ongoing work to unify US accounting practices and the international financial reporting standards which are used in Ireland, but this work is slow and hopes that this work would have been completed by 2015 will not be realised.  This Bill is necessary as it seeks to provide confidence as to the future accounting rules for companies either already located here or those considering locating here.  The Bill will eliminate duplication of cost and effort for such companies as they will not be required to prepare two sets of accounts under two sets of accounting standards.  This is a further common-sense measure being taken by this Government to return Ireland to the highest ranks in terms of international competitiveness and I commend all involved as their work will help smooth the financial path for American multinationals already located in Ireland and also for those considering locating a European headquarters in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the views of my colleagues, Deputies Terence Flanagan and Paul J. Connaughton.  I refer to the battle to attract foreign direct investment.  The template for attracting foreign direct investment which this country has used in the past has proved very successful.  I refer to statistical information on Ireland&rsquo;s share of foreign direct investment and our share of global income which shows that the country attracts two and a half to three times more investment than our size suggests.  We are doing exceptionally well in attracting this investment.  It is hoped this Bill will provide the support that is required in this regard.  There continues to be a great need to diversify the number of trading partners we have as quickly as possible, as well as the number of investment sources.  That is why I welcome the trade delegation the Taoiseach led to China, which included the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  We should quickly build up our trading relationships with that region.  The willingness of companies there to invest in Ireland is of gigantic importance.</P>
        <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation have done much work to attract investment from the digital gaming and video games sector.  That industrial sector is already bigger than the music industry internationally and will soon overtake the film industry.  The jobs action plan recently published by the Government contains a section of action steps to be taken on that sector.  I wish to flag the need for us to deliver on those action steps.  It was recently reported that the company producing the Angry Birds online video game, which is an extraordinarily successful product globally, is considering shifting its European headquarters to Dublin.  If that were to happen, it would be very beneficial for the signals regarding that sector in Ireland.  However, we must also deliver upon the steps we have taken to support our indigenous companies in the same sector.  The publication of the next quarterly update on our jobs action plan will be important in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will end on a point that I know is close to the heart of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews.  It concerns the accountability of those who implement accounting practices and oversee accountancy codes.  To our cost both here and globally, we have seen that companies which were meant to be overseeing the accuracy and veracity of statements of banks and other companies have let us down.  Apart from one incident when a company that was involved in an American firm went bankrupt, I am still at a loss to understand what steps we have taken to improve the accountability of companies within Ireland who are responsible for signing off on accounts and ensuring they represent true and realistic estimates of what is happening within a company.  While that is a theme for another day, I cannot let a Bill that refers to accounting come before the House without referring to that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is unavoidably absent and cannot deal personally with this Bill, so he has asked me to deputise for him.</P>
        <P>I wish to thank all the Deputies who spoke on the Bill for their helpful and interesting contributions to the debate, and for the level of support which was evident from what they had to say.  On behalf of the Minister, I will respond to some of the issues raised in the House both last night and today.  To begin with, it should be emphasised that this is not a new provision as such, rather it is one which extends the timeframe provided for the use of the accounting standards in question in sections 1 and 2 of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dea made some valid and knowledgeable points both in relation to accounting generally and to accounting standards.  In particular, Deputies O&rsquo;Dea and Ross raised general issues concerning audits on which the following observations are relevant.  The subject of audits is active at EU level at present.  In the wake of the financial crisis, the European Commission brought forward proposals in the audit area, in the form of an interlinked draft directive and regulation.  These measures are aimed at addressing perceived weaknesses in the audit process shown up by the financial turmoil of the past number of years, and of delivering enhanced audit quality.  The draft audit directive and regulation are being considered by member states in Brussels at present and the Minister&rsquo;s Department is participating in these negotiations.  The European Parliament is conducting its own parallel examination of the measures.</P>
        <P>The proposed regulation addresses itself to the audit of systemic entities or so-called public interest entities, a category that includes many institutions which were part of the financial crisis.  These audit proposals seek to address a number of concerns, including the independence of auditors from their clients; possible absence on auditors&rsquo; part of professional scepticism; and lack of top-end audit competition and choice.  Another theme covered is that of the expectation gap between what it was anticipated the audit would do and what materialised from the audit process.  This is just a flavour of these audit proposals.  The negotiations in Brussels are expected to continue for a good part of the next year.  To assist in formulating its policy position on these issues, the Minister&rsquo;s Department has consulted with stakeholders to obtain their views and has also established a contact group with relevant stakeholders which will meet regularly as negotiations progress in Brussels.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s general approach is one of seeking proportionality in the measures to be adopted, with a focus on achieving the best possible audit quality.  The expectation is that some kind of common approach will be worked out arising from negotiations at Council level over the next six to nine months or so.  This would parallel consideration in the European Parliament.  Given that Ireland will have the Presidency of the European Union from 1 January until 30 June 2013, the Department is likely to be overseeing progress at a vital stage of these audit issues.  In preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the Minister will shortly be meeting with the chairpersons of various groups in the European Parliament, which examine various legislative proposals.  From this he will be able to form a clearer view of the way ahead on this and other areas relating to his overall remit.  Obviously, whatever package of measures is adopted by the EU will be incorporated in Irish legislation.</P>
        <P>Another important factor in the audit equation is that of quality assurance in respect of the audit of public interest entities.  Independent quality assurance of audit firms regarding public interest entity audits is an important step to rebuilding audit confidence dented during the financial crisis.  The Department is currently finalising logistical aspects of the practical implementation of such a provision based on the EU Commission recommendation in the matter, which will entail direct inspections of relevant audit firms&rsquo; files by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  This will require primary legislation, and it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to make a submission to Government shortly for drafting approval for this.</P>
        <P>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the issue of the desirability of developing links between the domestic economy and the FDI.  In that regard, I would like to point to the action plan for jobs which provides for collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland on maximising procurement opportunities with multinational companies.</P>
        <P>Deputy Healy-Rae referred to setting up a scheme whereby community groups would be able to access audits based on a competitive pricing structure.  This is not a policy matter for the Minister&rsquo;s Department, although the idea of shopping around might be explored.  However, the position regarding audit exemption for companies which have formed themselves as companies limited by guarantee &mdash; which Deputies Michael Healy-Rae, Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe raised &mdash; is that entities with charitable status are governed by the Charities Act 2009 under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  They are answerable to their stakeholders, shareholders and funders.  Many charities which formed themselves as companies have done so as companies limited by guarantee, CLGs.  Due to their public membership structure, they cannot avail of an audit exemption.  The 2009 report of the Company Law Review Group examined the issue of extending audit exemption to companies limited by guarantee.  It made the following recommendations.  Subject in each case to consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the charities regulator, the audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to such class or classes of CLGs which are charitable organisations within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009 so as to bring them into alignment with charitable organisations that are not companies provided that 10% of the members with voting rights can require an audit.  The audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to all CLGs which are not charitable organisations subject to a veto right by any one member of the company and further subject to the requirement that audit exemption in respect of the following year shall be an item on the agenda of the annual general meeting.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, proposes that provisions giving effect to the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Group in this matter be included in the companies Bill which it is proposed to publish in the second half of this year.  I can assure Deputy Durkan that it is the intention to introduce the companies consolidation Bill later this year and to bring it before the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity thereafter.  The CLRG recommendations contemplate that any proposals in this context will be subject to consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P>Regarding the second point raised by Deputy Healy-Rae concerning the putting in place of systems to protect sub-contractors, I understand that Senator Feargal Quinn has put forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Construction Contracts Bill, which is currently being considered by this House and deals with issues such as those of concern to Deputy Healy-Rae.  Company law does not afford an appropriate mechanism to deal with this issue in the form in which it most commonly arises.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath expressed concern in his contribution about the amount of red tape which inhibits the creation of jobs and development.  The Government is to create an environment in which more businesses can be established and expanded to create the jobs we so badly need.  A crucial aspect of this will be a reduction in costs faced by business.  The Government is taking urgent action to address the costs which are directly within its control.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I again express my appreciation for Deputies&rsquo; contributions to this debate and for their manifest support for the proposal.  As already stated, many of the beneficiary companies have a presence in this country and provide valuable employment and they will be encouraged to deepen and expand their activities in Ireland in future years.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to the House for this debate.</P>
        <P>I recall clearly the time of day and circumstances in which I met the three people who came to me and told me they had been abused.  I also recall the discussion I had with them as they did their best to describe to me the horror inflicted upon them and the impact it had on their lives.  Those of us who have had the experience of engaging with survivors of this darkest period in our history could not help but be touched by their experiences and could not be anything less than humbled by the manner in which so many of them have endured their experiences and gone on to achieve so much, despite what was inflicted upon them in the past.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago, I visited an institution which was previously an environment within which abuse and deprivation was inflicted upon children resident therein.  I recall walking through long corridors, off which there were small rooms in which there were tiny beds stacked side by side.  These were the rooms in which many children were abused and endured experiences which many of us cannot comprehend.  Having met with survivors of abuse and visited an environment in which this abuse was inflicted upon people, I was interested in the proposals of the previous Government and in the work this Government is doing on how we respond to this issue, what we can do to ensure we reflect the horror of society at what happened and to recognise the diverse needs of the people with us now who endured these experiences.</P>
        <P>I would like to make four points in regard to this Bill, some of which were touched on by other speakers in this House and by the Minister in his Second Stage speech, which I had an opportunity to read earlier.  The first is an issue acknowledged by the Minister in terms of the process being created in the Bill focusing on people who have already engaged with an extensive redress procedure.  As I understand it, this new process will be aimed at people who have already completed the redress process.  However, an issue arises in respect of people who have not participated in that process.  I know from discussing Bills like this in the past that a huge amount of work and publicity was put into raising the profile of what went on in the past to ensure everyone whose lives were touched by it had an opportunity to participate in the redress process.  However, if people who did not participate in that process for whatever reason come forward we should do what we can to accommodate them and respond to their needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister made the fair point that we need to use the money we have, which is a large amount, in the best way possible, which I understand.  He also indicated that it would be a matter for the board of the new organisation created under this legislation to consider how it might respond to people who come forward, depending on the amount of money remaining.  Given that the number of people who may come forward will, I hope, be small in comparison to the number who have already come forward, I would urge the Minister to ensure everything possible is done to meet their needs.  We owe it to them to do so.  I acknowledge there was a great deal of activity at home and abroad to ensure everyone was aware of the redress process.  However, I do not want us to end up in a situation whereby any group of people or individual is excluded.  They have gone through so much as a consequence of the State not exercising its duty of care and I do not want to see this compounded by their not being able to access the new system being created in the Bill.</P>
        <P>This brings me to my next point, on the ease of access to the new system being established.  The people involved in establishing and working on the board will do all they can to ensure people applying for services to be funded can do so easily through a system that is not too cumbersome.  However, I am conscious that while no State organisation has been established with the objective to come up with difficult processes and forms we have many such forms and processes.  It is very important that when this is up and running it should be well run and it should be easy for people to access funding for services to which they may be entitled.  I do not want to see the three people I have met who have been touched by this having to fill out forms and go through processes which are cumbersome and too difficult when applying for funding for services to which they are entitled.  We must avoid this.</P>
        <P>As the Bill goes through the House will the Minister clarify the stance of the new organisation on means testing?  The Bill makes reference to the circumstances of an individual and the hardship endured.  We owe it to them to ensure the services funded by the scheme are open and available to everybody.  In my short experience of dealing with this issue and meeting people affected by it, unfortunately they do not have such a level of means that the availability of this would not matter to them.  The services being funded will make a real difference to the lives of those accessing the scheme being established by the Government.  I would be very reluctant for these services to be means tested given where the funding is coming from, what these people have gone through and the impact these services could have on their lives.  They have gone through enough.  We know where the money is coming from and we should make it as easy as possible for people to access it and make as little reference as possible to their means.</P>
        <P>The next point I want to consider is whether funding or grants should be provided for services or directly allocated to individuals.  Various views have been expressed on this and those accessing the scheme will have already gone through the redress procedure.  Even at this stage I have some unease with telling an individual who has gone through this that funding is being refused because what it was requested for does not meet the prescribed services laid out in the Bill or the State does not believe it is appropriate that the money is spent in a particular way.  I urge those who will run the fund to be imaginative always and take into account the needs of those they meet.</P>

	<P>If the services prescribed in section 8 of the Bill do not meet the needs of those coming to the new organisation, or a significant minority of them, we should stand up and admit it and be willing to change the contents of the Bill.  We should acknowledge their lives have been seared and damaged enough already.  We should do all we can to be as imaginative and creative as possible to meet the needs they articulate.</P>
        <P>I had a discussion with members of a family seared by this issue and they are aware of the services being provided in the Bill.  They told me they understand how the redress procedure worked, that they were able to access some help from the State but that what is provided for in the Bill does not meet their needs.  I struggle to understand why, given how their lives have already been touched by this horror, we should refuse a request they make.  I read what the Minister stated on Second Stage and the Government has put much effort into examining all of the views of people who have come in.  It is very difficult to achieve consensus on any issue let alone one that is so unbelievably difficult for the families concerned.  With regard to section 8 of the Bill I urge the new organisation to be constantly vigilant in its administration.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work done by the Department, the Minister and his predecessors in grappling with a truly horrific issue and the progress the Bill represents.  None of us should state we have done our best and our best is enough.  We must always be open to the views of those touched by this and do all we can to ensure the services we provide to them meet their diverse and unmet needs.  I thank the Minister for being in the House and for acknowledging the strong feelings and interest articulated by everybody on this point.  However, I also wish to register my unease.  After everything that has gone on and a very extensive redress procedure, I do not want to find the needs of anyone touched by this horror to remain unmet.  Constant vigilance on this point is very important and is due to the people involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s presence in the House illustrates the commitment he and the Government have, and the commitment we all should have, to this very important Bill.  I was struck by a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> from a lady in Newport, County Tipperary published on 23 April.  She wrote about being a second-generation survivor and that it is only through access to education that the cycle of poverty is broken.  She wrote that she wants to provide her children with what she was denied, which is an education of choice.  Deputy Donohoe is correct that none of us has any idea of the pain or the horrendous life of the survivors.  We hear the term &ldquo;survivors group&rdquo; and it is great to have such an umbrella term but we are speaking about people.  We are talking about our fellow citizens whose hearts thump and whose lives have been touched and changed.  More important, they have come from the other side to illuminate and give us hope and inspiration.  Everything we do must be to ensure these people&rsquo;s lives are enhanced and protected.  I am very heartened by section 7 which states that the functions of the board will be based on the principles of equity, consistency and transparency.  I agree with Deputy Donohoe that everything we do must be done not in order to exclude but to include.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to be patronising, I am very heartened that this week under the Minister&rsquo;s watch the memorial committee met.  That is not just about a memorial to the wrongdoing of our State and church, but also about the hope that the men and women who had to endure institutional abuse can find a better way and better life.  I was touched to meet a number of the gentlemen on the plinth today, including people from my city of Cork and from Tipperary.  They have lived such a life and are promoting an advocacy role to which we must all listen and I am very heartened that we will do that.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the protection of children and all lives.  I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which is holding hearings on the draft heads of the children first Bill.  I hope that a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will be held this year.  We need to listen carefully to the people who have come out of these institutions.  I hate to use the term &ldquo;survivors group&rdquo; because it does not do them justice.  These are citizens with rights and entitlements.  Deputy Donohoe is correct in saying we should not exclude anybody if we can.  I hope that those who have not come forward will do so.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is very important in providing for the areas of counselling, health care, education, housing and other services for the victims of abuse.  This cannot be a one-dimensional approach and needs to be a multifaceted approach across Departments and State agencies.  While we are rightly very quick to condemn the church and the institutions, the State also failed people.  The State has a duty of care and must live up to its responsibility.  Our overriding concern as legislators and as citizens must be the protection and enhancement of the quality of life of the people.  It is very important that the State listens and that the Government is not just committed in word but also in action.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome that the Minister will pursue the 50:50 clause that has been inserted.  In his reply I ask him to clarify of what it is 50:50.  While 50:50 sounds great, it is important to spell out what it means in nuts and bolts.  I have met some people I know in the religious orders.  Some have been very clear in their intent, while others have obfuscated and been left to meander around, which should not be allowed anymore.  I commend the Minister on his approach.</P>
        <P>We are talking about fellow citizens of our country who were abused by our own people &mdash; that is the bottom line.  The job of the State and church must be to take our responsibilities seriously.  The Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports have revealed a legacy of abuse and an abdication of responsibility.  The implementation must recognise the needs of the survivors and the responsibility of the State and the church.  That is why we collectively must work with the Minister on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill which deals with people who were ignored for decades by the State and were repeatedly failed.  They deserve what the Bill gives them and the protection it offers them.  This small country of ours has been plagued by many scandals over the years but none has been bigger than the horrifying institutional abuse from which so many of our citizens have suffered.</P>
        <P>The numbers of people attending this week&rsquo;s Eucharistic Congress compared with the one in the 1930s reflect the hurt many people feel following a series of damning reports.  Not only has the continued institutional abuse destroyed many people&rsquo;s faith, but it has also destroyed lives.  The church and State were complicit in this, side by side with each other.  In recent years the people have repeatedly learned of the pure horror of what these people have gone through.  We hear the stories, read about them, try to imagine what people went through, are sickened about what happened to them and then we forget and try to move on with our lives.  It is not so simple for the victims and their families.  They cannot forget and have to live with what happened to them which is why the services provided in this fund are so vital.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the legislation, I cannot help feeling that the State continues to ignore some victims of institutional abuse as is happening in this legislation.  The fund only applies to those who received compensation from the residential institutions redress fund.  This only incorporates the victims of 139 different institutions.  While it is easy to think that everyone who was institutionally abused is covered in those 139 institutions &mdash; owing to the vastness of that number &mdash; a significant number of additional institutions are not covered by the legislation.  For example, those from the Magdalene laundries, among others, are not entitled to anything from this new fund.  The Minister has said he may review who is eligible for the fund.  Do we really need another review?  We know who needs to be included and we know who should already be included.  A painstaking review that will take months to be published and then delayed, as with most other reviews this Government has carried out, is not the approach to take on the issue of eligibility.  We do not need a review for everything we do in this House given that they waste time, cost money and in the majority of cases give the expected result.  All victims must be included and there is no viable argument to suggest otherwise.</P>
        <P>The Minster has basically said that we cannot afford to open the fund to all victims of institutional abuse because the fund of &euro;110 million would be depleted by the amount of applications, which is a sorry state of affairs and a shocking insight into Irish history.  We must work to ensure all victims of institutional abuse have the services and funds they deserve available to them.  We cannot fail these people again.</P>
        <P>In addition, while I welcome that religious congregations are completely funding this new fund, along with many of my colleagues in opposition and government, I am concerned that the fund has only received &euro;20 million of the amount due to it.  The congregations have claimed they are waiting for this legislation to pass before they make their agreed payments.  We all know this legislation will pass and while it is not perfect and needs to be worked on during the legislative process, why are the congregations holding on to their funds?  Why have they not already paid so the services that are made available to the survivors in this legislation can be made available as soon as possible?</P>
        <P>These people have been waiting for the services provided for in this legislation since the 2009 Ryan report and it is now 2012.  They waited long enough for an apology and they waited long enough for compensation &mdash; we cannot make them wait any longer for the support that is rightfully theirs.  The Government must ensure that the funding is in place as soon as the legislation is passed.  It cannot be denied that the bureaucracy and red tape involved in this legislation only add to the pain of survivors.  Many survivor groups have called for a simple, quick service that can serve them in the best way possible.  The services that will be provided to survivors as a result by this Bill are necessary and appropriate, but the way they must be vetted and approved before the people can avail of them may cause some delay.  Nobody can deny that approving the service will take a significant amount of time and in many cases victims might not have this time.  Many are already struggling.</P>
        <P>This is one of the reasons for the distrust between survivor groups and the State.  Some feel the State should not be involved in this fund and that the groups should be given the funds directly so they can do what they believe is best for the survivors.  Who can argue, indeed, that the survivors do not know best what is appropriate for them?  The only way the State can prove to survivors that it is capable is by ensuring that a quick, appropriate service is provided.  It is the least we can do for those who need it.  The residential institutions redress fund cost &euro;100 million more than was originally envisaged, nearly the entire cost of this new fund.  That was attributed to a surge of late applications, third-party legal bills and expenses.  All of this added more time to the process of distributing funds.  In fact, some of these applications are still being processed.  Furthermore, all donations of property must be approved by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  Again, this will take a considerable amount of time and place further time pressures on how the Government gets the &euro;110 million required for the residential institutions statutory fund being established by this Bill.</P>
        <P>My party is also concerned that family members cannot avail of this fund.  Family members of victims are also victims.  They have had to deal in many instances with their father or mother being emotionally distressed, depressed and mentally affected as a result of the failure of church and State to protect them.  The Education Finance Board, which will be dissolved as a result of this Bill, made provisions to provide educational opportunities for victims and their family members.  That is not the case with this new fund.  Only former residents can avail of educational opportunities.  We must work to ensure that the families of victims are also catered for by the State as they are also victims of our repeated failures.  The Minister has said that education is very important for the survivors&rsquo; families and that use of the fund for that purpose would be appropriate.  Why is there no allocation of the fund towards victims&rsquo; families?  We must provide some assistance for the families as well as the victims.</P>
        <P>We are also concerned about funding for survivor groups.  Until now, survivor groups were funded by the Government, but that will no longer be the case after this legislation is passed.  Without these groups, we would not be in the situation we are in today.  We would probably not be discussing this legislation.  In 1999, we would not have had the heinously overdue apology from the State.  These groups have done more for survivors than we ever have and it would be wrong to stop supporting them.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of this is the fact that the outreach services in the UK will no longer be funded by the Government.  My party is particularly concerned about this.  Our links with Britain are closer than with any other country.  In every recession we have experienced, the UK has offered an escape route, somewhere the Irish could get work which their own country could not provide.  However, for many, the UK was a much more serious escape route.  Many victims left their hellish experience of the Irish State behind them to start a new life in Britain, never to return.  Many were unsuccessful as the scale of abuse they suffered could not be altered, even though their country of residence had changed.  For this reason, four outreach services were set up in the UK to help the people who left this country as a result of their experience of abuse in early life.</P>
        <P>This legislation will mean those four outreach services will no longer be funded by the Government.  I am concerned that the forgotten victims of the Irish State will be forgotten once more after these services close.  How can the Government ensure that they will be able to contact these people and how will it ensure they know of the services that are available to them?</P>

    <Title>Common Fisheries Policy: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to update the House on the result of a long but successful Council of Ministers meeting last night.  Its objective was to get agreement among member states on a Common Position from the Council&rsquo;s perspective on the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, reform.  This morning&rsquo;s EU Fisheries Council adopted a general approach on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  This general approach will form the negotiating mandate for the Council in the negotiations with the EU Parliament, which will commence after the EU Parliament has established its position.  This will happen in the autumn.  It is very likely that the negotiations between the Council and Parliament will take place during the first half of 2013, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the Fisheries Council focused on finding solutions to political issues in the Common Fisheries Policy reform package.  Following the intensive negotiations, lasting 20 hours into this morning, the Council agreed a general approach.  While there was general political agreement in advance of the Fisheries Council on the overall objective of eliminating discards, the issue that had to be solved was how to practically achieve a situation where fishing practices were changed while protecting the economic viability of the fishing industry.  In order to find solutions, I tabled at the Council a new approach to deal with discards which took into account the real practical difficulties of changing practices, the economic impacts and other constraints which impact on fishermen in mixed fisheries.  The proposal involved delivering a progressive and phased approach to the obligation to land catches of quota stocks in a mixed fishery context.  I met fishing industry representatives last Thursday for detailed discussions on this approach.  On Monday evening, I again met the industry representatives who had travelled to Luxembourg for the Council discussions and discussed with them the options and strategy for the Council meeting.</P>
        <P>My approach combined appropriate technical measures to reduce catches of juveniles and other vulnerable stocks with quota adjustments to facilitate the transition for fishermen and cushion any early economic hardship that might result.  The practical arrangements involved setting a start date and an end date for the delivery of a requirement to land all catches of quota stocks in each fishery.  This approach was focused on incentivising changes in fishing practices, reducing catches of juvenile fish and allowing fish stocks to grow over a set period.  I believe this approach stood the best chance of securing buy-in from fishermen and, in this way, delivering effective, more environmentally friendly fishing practices and sustainable fisheries into the future.</P>
        <P>At the Council, I worked closely with fellow Ministers to agree appropriate measures.  It is worth noting that some Ministers were seeking the immediate application of a discards ban to all species while others were seeking to delay the requirement to land all stocks until the latest possible date, even as late as 2020.  The proposals I had tabled offered a middle ground which was viewed, especially by Ministers where the fishing sector is economically important, as practical and deliverable.  In the end, the Council&rsquo;s position supports a three  year phasing in of the requirement to land all quota stocks in mixed fisheries.  It sets a start date of 1 January 2015 for whitefish stocks in Irish waters and provides that this will apply to all species by the end of 2018 at the latest.  As for pelagic stocks, such as herring and mackerel, the requirement to land all catches applies from 1 January 2014.</P>
        <P>A critical part of my approach involves ensuring that fishermen will not be disadvantaged, from a quota perspective, arising from this new requirement to land all quota stocks.  I am pleased that, as part of the package, Commissioner Damanaki committed to further work in this regard specifying that the elimination of discards is not intended to reduce fishing opportunities.  I secured a specific declaration from her on that issue.  At the Council, the Commissioner accepted additional quotas must be introduced to meet the additional landings arising from this new policy.</P>
        <P>The final and most important element of the package on discards relates to introducing technical measures, such as mesh size increases and escape panels, to reduce catches of juvenile fish to a minimum.  The arrangements provide that member states, on a regional basis, will work with their industry and other stakeholders through the regional advisory councils to put in place such measures.  The policy&rsquo;s new regional approach to decision making will enable these measures, where agreed by member states, to be adopted without delay by the European Commission and introduced in the relevant fisheries.  I am confident Ireland will be in a position to move quickly on the adoption of these technical measures, which will support the phased introduction of the landing requirement in its mixed whitefish fisheries.</P>
        <P>There has been agreement on many of the other important issues under review.  Much progress has been made over recent months on many of Ireland&rsquo;s priority issues, in particular on agreeing a practical approach that will provide for decision making on a regional basis, as I noted earlier, as well as a commitment to deliver fish quotas based on scientific advice that will deliver a maximum sustainable yield per species in fisheries by 2015 where possible, and by 2020 at the latest for all stocks for which it is possible to put together information to make a calculation as to what is the maximum sustainable yield.  There also was agreement that at European level, the development of an aquaculture industry must be supported and the policy provides for regional advisory councils involving stakeholders for aquaculture to ensure problems can be discussed and resolved as they arise and that best practices are shared across all sectors.  I welcome this in particular as there is huge potential in Ireland to expand and grow aquaculture and finfish farming.  However, this must be done in a sustainable way and in the correct locations.</P>
        <P>Finally, and of paramount importance to Ireland, there was the removal of the mandatory proposals on privatisation of national fishing quotas from the Council&rsquo;s general approach.  I have been a strong opponent of this proposal as it would have threatened the economic survival of Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities essentially by allowing industries and individuals with the buying power potentially to buy up the white fish quota in particular from Irish fishing ports and would have consolidated the fishing industry in Ireland and potentially throughout Europe, which would have done untold and irreversible damage.  I welcome the arrangements now supported by the Council to allow each member state manage its fish quotas to take account of its own individual circumstances, as will Ireland.  Delivery of this key element was a vital part of the package, from my perspective, that allowed me to support it.  I consider this Council agreement to offer a strong and progressive Common Fisheries Policy reform.  I hope the new arrangements will be welcomed by both the industry and those campaigning for a more sustainable approach towards fisheries management.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for arranging this debate on foot of his marathon negotiating session at the Council meeting.  I attended such meetings in previous years and I understand the lengthy debates that continue deep into the night.  A system appears to have evolved over the years whereby Ministers are obliged to keep negotiating until it is almost morning before reaching an agreement.  However, I hope the package that has emerged will underpin a sustainable framework for fisheries into the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister certainly is correct in stating this Council meeting was one of the most important for years in setting out the future of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  It is important that Members on all sides of the House would be of like mind in ensuring that Irish fisheries are protected into the future and that, when the Common Fisheries Policy document finally comes before them, it will be of major benefit to Irish fishermen throughout the country.  While some reports of the meeting have presented its conclusions as a done deal, I am sure the Minister will accept much more work remains to be done in setting out the framework for a new Common Fisheries Policy.  Under the co-decision procedure implemented by the Lisbon Treaty, yesterday&rsquo;s meeting merely comprises one part of a two-step process to establish a new CFP.  As I am sure the Minister will accept, the proposal as agreed by the Council will now go before the European Parliament for further scrutiny, debate and amendment, if the latter is required.  In this context, I note Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP has been very much to the forefront on the subject of fisheries and on the fisheries committee and I hope the Irish MEPs will support the Minister in his endeavours to get the best deal possible for Irish fishermen.  I understand the Parliament will not complete its report until October, after which negotiations will commence between the Council and the Parliament.  As the Minister noted, it will be deep into 2013 before the CFP is finalised.  The Minister should acknowledge that reports presenting the CFP as a done deal are wide of the mark.  It is to be hoped the Minister will have a major say when Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union and that he will be at the coalface of ensuring the Common Fisheries Policy is the best deal on the table for Ireland and for Irish fishermen, as I am sure he will.</P>
        <P>The CFP system for Irish fishermen continues to provide a system which I believe tries to set out a structured and sustainable management of international fishing activity in each of the key areas of interest to Irish fishermen, particularly in the rich north-east Atlantic.  It sets out stable arrangements for access to the large European Union seafood market for the large volumes of Irish seafood products the Irish fishing industry exports to those markets.  This sustains direct employment for fishermen and creates spin-off jobs in the agrifood industry.  In this context, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement regarding grant aid for different companies around the coastline.  I am aware of one if not two companies in County Wexford that received grant aid.  While Kilmore Quay is at the hub of the fishing industry, it also is at the hub of adding value to the fish products provided by the fishermen.  It is only right that such companies should get the support and assistance announced by the Minister last week.  It will ensure they will be able to develop further products and markets, as well as ensuring jobs along the coastline, which is very important in certain rural areas.  This industry is an important part of the economy and contributes between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million annually to national income, as well as employing 1,100 people around the coastline.  I consider it to be highly important to the continuation of a viable rural Ireland and I note that at present, agriculture and fisheries appear to be the two main areas that are doing well.  It is important this should continue, because agriculture and fishing are areas in which there is huge potential for job creation.  The Minister spoke about aquaculture. Like him, I have a deep interest in this industry.  I know it can be very controversial at times but there are opportunities to develop it.  The amount of fish available to the EU at present is only about 70% sustainable within the Union and there are opportunities for Ireland to develop this industry.  I welcome that the Minister is now looking at a different approach in that, as he informed us last week, BIM will now apply for licences in certain parts of the country.  If it gets the licence for aquaculture the industry will be under State control and I imagine BIM will be able to lease the licences to companies that want to develop and be involved in aquaculture.  It is a good and even a novel way of doing things.  As we know, and as the Minister is aware, the hoops one must go through to get an aquaculture licence in recent years have made it practically impossible to renew an existing licence and certainly impossible to get a new one.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s approach in this regard.  The future of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is vital to those jobs and to the marine tradition of the coastal regions of Ireland which have a proud fishing heritage.  In this light, yesterday&rsquo;s meeting was of critical importance to the people who are reliant on a sustainable and practical framework for their livelihoods in the fishing industry.</P>
        <P>It is also important that we assess in detail the outcome of yesterday&rsquo;s meeting and review it in light of what fishermen believe its practical impact will be on their livelihoods, what the analysis of the industry as a whole is and also in respect of the broader fundamental question of the creation of a fisheries policy that recognises and adapts to the need to create a sustainable industry.  &ldquo;Sustainable&rdquo; is a very important word both at EU level and for the Fisheries Commissioner.  I know the Minister has had to bend the ear of the Commissioner on several occasions to ensure that while we have a sustainable industry it is also a practical one that is not tied up with red tape and bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>I understand the issue of discarding of fish, whereby unwanted catches of dead fish are thrown back into the sea, was by far the most contentious element of the discussions yesterday and from what I heard in conversation with Pat the Cope Gallagher this issue could have derailed the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach an agreement.  There is no easy solution to the discard situation.  Different Ministers at EU level have looked at the issue and discussed it but very few decisions were made in the past.  Significant media and industrial attention has been paid to the issue and to the future of fishing as a sustainable industry.  In every newspaper one read or took up in recent months, whether Irish, English or international, the discard issue is one where there has been major criticism of the lack of action within the EU.  The United Nations has stated that the north-east Atlantic has the second highest discards level in the world, estimated to be 1.3 million tonnes annually.  Most of these discards are attributed to EU fishermen and are carried out under the current EU Common Fisheries Policy.  The Minister&rsquo;s compromise obviously averted the prospect of a collapse but we must question this.  Perhaps when the Minister comments at the end of the debate he might take on board what the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation chief executive, Sean O&rsquo;Donoghue, said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  He was highly critical of the decision of the Minister and argued that his organisation&rsquo;s policy of minimising discards by expanding fish nets and systematically avoiding specific areas offers a better method of reducing the elimination of fishing stock.  Whether the fish are discarded or landed, they are dead and fishing stocks suffer as a result.  There are real questions as to how practical a solution the compromise will be in reality for boats fishing in the Atlantic.  I hope the Minister might elaborate somewhat on the concerns of Sean O&rsquo;Donoghue.  There is a very real fear that the compromise which has emerged may serve PR purposes rather than tackle the issue of sustainable fishing stocks.</P>
        <P>The specific proposals involved cover outstanding issues.  Most of the measures adopted are welcome and progressive steps but I believe difficulties may emerge with the implementation of some.  The compromise aims to achieve maximum sustainable yields by 2015 where possible, and by 2020 at the latest.  A consultation with third countries concerned will be initiated in cases where stocks are shared.  Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on these third countries and how he sees this evolving.  There has been some controversy in recent months about how third countries operate and we need more clarification on that.</P>
        <P>On multiannual plans, the compromise establishes that member states should manage fisheries in more detail through quantifiable targets linked to biological parameters, as well as to safeguards and remedies.  It applies the principle of maximum sustainable yields to the significant stocks in multiannual plans while specific measures apply to other stocks with an approach that takes into account interactions between stocks.  We would welcome the multiannual plans as a good idea.</P>
        <P>A gradual approach of the policy of landing obligation is proposed but the aim is still the elimination of discards.  Concerning the landing obligation in identified fisheries, a specification through multiannual plans within a fixed timeframe is laid down.</P>
        <P>Regionalisation has been an area of controversy in recent months and is an issue that was raised by fishermen throughout the country.  This concept is now supported by a majority of member states as it accepts that one size does not fit all.  It is very important that the Minister succeeded in getting concessions in this area.  The compromise introduces an alternative model for regionalisation whereby member states adopt national measures through regional co-operation.  This is a welcome step for the future of the fisheries industry in Ireland because what was initially planned would certainly not have suited Irish fishermen.  Again, the Minister has come up to the plate and is keeping the fishermen reasonably happy in that particular area.</P>
        <P>The compromise foresees the creation of additional advisory councils &mdash; one for the Black Sea and one for the outermost regions of the EU.  We welcome that.  I refer to transferable fishing concessions and capacity management which are also very welcome.</P>
        <P>Consumer information is one of the key areas.  The consumer is king and needs to have full information to hand about the types of products he or she is purchasing, the environmental factors and the sustainability of such products.   The Minister might elaborate on what the Commissioners mentioned in regard to developing an EU sustainability label.  I wonder how that would operate and how it would affect a country like Ireland where we talk about the green environment and about producing quality food, quality fish and farming products in a green area.</P>
        <P>The European Parliament will look at these matters before negotiating with the Council.  Over the coming months it is vital that the matters raised are thoroughly looked into and their practical impact is analysed.  It is very important the MEPs work closely with the Minister on this area in order to get the best possible deal in the end.  I hope the Minister will be in place when Ireland has the EU Presidency and that he will be at the coalface to ensure the Irish fishing industry is protected in every part of the country and is allowed to develop and expand.  Yesterday&rsquo;s meeting is a significant step in the creation of a new Common Fisheries Policy but it is only one step on the long road that remains.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that and is prepared for the long haul.  It will be a long haul trying to negotiate his way and satisfy every fisherman in this country.  That is not an easy task but he made an important point, one that I found to be the same when I was in that job, namely, it is important to have like-minded countries on board that will support us and help us to try to achieve the ultimate &mdash; what is best for Irish fishermen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only right and proper to welcome what has happened in the past 24 hours and acknowledge the role of the Minister, on which I commend him.  I understand from Conor Heaney, who works in the office of the Northern Ireland Minister, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, that an all-Ireland approach was taken during the negotiations on this.  That is a welcome development.  During any negotiations, it is essential for interested parties to work together for the common good.  In this case, the Ministers were working together for the good of Irish fishermen.</P>
        <P>The fisheries deal that was reached in advance of this country&rsquo;s accession to the then EEC was a disaster for Irish fisheries.  Forty years on, the Government must focus on getting a fair deal for Irish fisheries.  The main problem faced by the Irish fishing sector is that the management of the industry is almost exclusively in the hands of the EU and is bound by the Common Fisheries Policy.  This policy is the successor of the fishery policy that was framed by the original six members of the EEC prior to the accession of Ireland, Britain and Denmark.  The countries in question drew it up with a view to securing a share in a massive resource in which they were deficient.  The Irish fleet was given a small share in the catch in waters off our coast, reflecting the lack of domestic development in the years prior to accession.  Since then, the outworking of the EU stock management policy has had a dramatic impact on Irish fishermen.  The Irish fishing fleet has been reduced by a third since 1993.  It is clear that the intention is to accelerate the rate of decommissioning.  Until now, Irish officials have accepted that there is a clear intent to reduce the fleet to one that operates from two or three large ports.  Such a change would be of huge concern.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Common Fisheries Policy review group highlighted the inequalities and injustices of the Common Fisheries Policy as it existed at that time.  It was pointed out that despite Ireland accounting for 11% of EU fishing waters at that time, Irish fishermen had only just 4% of the EU quota.  The group particularly emphasised the importance of fishing to the west of Ireland.  It said there was a need to break out of the straightjacket of a policy that was inhibiting the development of the fishing sector.  Despite occasional public criticism of the Common Fisheries Policy, the official response to requests that it be radically reformed to address the issue of unequal quota allocation has invariably been that the mechanism for determining quota is historically based and more or less set in stone, in line with the so-called &ldquo;relative stability&rdquo; policy.</P>
        <P>Estimates of the value of the fish taken from Irish waters by non-Irish vessels since 1973 vary.  Some sources have placed the figure at &euro;16 billion while others, using EUROSTAT figures for the amount of fish taken from Irish waters and their potential value including processed value, have placed the figure as high as &euro;200 billion.  No one who is involved in Irish fishing appears to be prepared to defend the Common Fisheries Policy.  Many proposals have been made for it to be radically overhauled, particularly with regard to the allocation of quota, which disadvantages the Irish fleet significantly on the basis of the historical allocations that were made in previous years.  There is a general recognition at Irish level and in Brussels of the need to acknowledge the historical disadvantage that has been imposed by EU policy since 1973.  It is accepted that the Irish Government should take primary responsibility for the future management of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
        <P>The current talks on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy were completed last night.  I welcome the agreement that was reached by the member states involved to allow for greater regionalisation.  It is imperative for local knowledge of the fishing industry to be used to create a more progressive policy.  This can only be done if the red tape and bureaucracy that surrounds the approach of Brussels to the Common Fisheries Policy is replaced by greater regionalisation.  The Irish fishing industry has been done a great disservice since Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the EEC.  I hope this move will be a step on the road to rectifying the current problem.  The Irish fishing industry has been micro-managed for too long.  This is an opportunity to give fishermen some form of democratic control over their future.</P>
        <P>The ban on the discarding of fish is also to be welcomed.  EU rules mean that more than 1 million tonnes of fish are discarded into the sea every year.  These fish account for up to 90% of catches in some fisheries.  This action is utter madness.  A ban on the practice was long overdue.  The practice of discarding healthy fish into the sea illustrates how out of touch the Brussels bureaucracy was with the Irish fishing industry and the industry throughout Europe.  It was beyond ridiculous for healthy fish to be discarded due to EU rules at a time when Irish fishermen were coming under severe pressure from Europe due to low fish stocks.  We are waiting for a final deal to be passed by the European Parliament.  The ban on this practice must be welcomed.  It is important for the ban to be introduced correctly and in a way that allows fishermen to change the practices they have been forced into under European rules.  Fishermen have often been portrayed in an extremely negative fashion because their practices have been seen to destroy fish stocks.  I suggest that poor management from Brussels was the main contributing factor to these stocks being damaged.</P>
        <P>Other issues must be addressed.  Increased access to our waters by EU states has led to serious problems within the Irish fishing industry.  Irish fishermen have borne the brunt of these problems.  This must be rectified.  There is a strong belief among fishermen that illegal fishing by non-Irish boats is underestimated.  On that basis, there are proposals that fisheries control and surveillance should be related to quota so that vessels from bigger fleets can be given proportionate attention.  At present, the protection agencies pay Irish vessels a disproportionate level of attention.  It is unwarranted when one considers the share of the quota in Irish waters enjoyed by the Irish fleet.  These and other issues must be addressed if we want a fair deal for Irish fishermen.</P>
        <P>The Council and the Commission accept that we will need to introduce additional quotas to meet the additional landings that will arise from this new policy.  The big problem for the Irish fishing industry has been the lack of quota.  That has to be addressed in a fair way that reflects the substantial waters we have under our control and the terrible mistakes of the past.  The lack of quota has contributed significantly to the massive decline in the fishing sector across our coast.  As representatives of coastal communities, Deputies Harrington and McHugh are well aware, as we are in the south west, of how depleted the whole sector has been in the last 30 years as a result of the lack of quota, lack of viable income and lack of political attention.  During his short period in office to date, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, appears to have given this sector his attention in a much better way than his predecessors in my lifetime.  I welcome that and commend him on it.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the general approach to the mandatory proposals on the privatisation of national fishing quota.  I think everyone in this House has been absolutely opposed to privatisation in this sector.  We have worked together collectively to oppose it.  It is good that the Minister has won support for our position among other EU countries.  I fully agree that the privatisation of fishing would be absolutely detrimental to the industry.  It would wreck whatever is left of the industry and the fishing communities.  All of us are singing from the same hymn sheet on the issue of decision-making on a regional basis.  That is to be commended.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his officials did a good night&rsquo;s work, or a good 20 hours&rsquo; work.  I am quite confident that the industry and its representatives are reasonably happy with the outcome.  We did not get everything we want, but we took a step in the right direction.  The position the Minister took on the question of discards, and the lead-in to the whole thing, was consistent with the position taken by my colleague in the Six Counties.  The success they achieved in that regard shows what can be done.  A small step has been taken as part of the effort to save what is left of our industry.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s position regarding aquaculture etc. enjoys almost unanimous support in this House.  If we focus on aquaculture and on natural fisheries, perhaps we can reverse the trend that has existed over the years and give hope to rural fishing communities.  If we can make such communities viable, we can help to sustain the society that exists in such places and help to rebuild this depleted and depressed sector of our economy.</P>
      
        <P>Again, go raibh maith agat.  Fair play to the Minister.  He has full support from me and my party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the statements on the Common Fisheries Policy review.  I welcome the positive news from the Council meeting last night and early this morning in Luxembourg, as well as the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to this debate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>When we debate the Common Fisheries Policy in this House, we should always start by mentioning the historical precedent that was set.  I believe this goes back prior to our accession to the European Economic Community, as it was at that time, where, while we were negotiating, the six so-called partners actually changed the rules to ensure they got control of our fisheries stocks.  They did this because they knew what we were bringing to the table.  I do not believe we were fully aware at that stage of the potential and resources we had.  From an Irish perspective, we need always to take this as a starting point when we talk about the CFP and about fisheries policies across the EU.  We need to set it as an objective to try to revisit that decision at some stage in the future and this needs to be a starting point in negotiations.</P>
        <P>That decision led directly to the CFP, which has gone through a number of reviews before the current review.  We have always been playing from a point where we were disadvantaged from the very start.  We were disadvantaged because decisions were taken by other countries in a negotiating stance that left us handicapped.  We need to try to find a way to rectify that at some future stage, which should be an overarching goal to work towards.  If we can achieve that sense of fairness and equality that is supposed to be the foundation stone of the EU, we can then have a fishing industry that can address some of the regional imbalances that exist within this State, where the west, north-west and south-west coasts have been underdeveloped historically.  It is only by trying to develop marine resources and aquaculture to the greatest potential possible that some of those imbalances can be reversed.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been praised and I would like to add to that and congratulate him on his work at the Council meeting.  The agreement on discards in particular is important for the Irish fishing industry.  There is much to be worked out in regard to the mechanics of how it will work and what the technical measures will involve.  Will the technical measures include, as Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue said on radio this morning, the inclusion of areas which are not fished at certain times, which would help to reduce the level of discards?  To have the measures for discards of pelagic fish come into effect on 1 January 2014 is more than likely achievable because there would not be as big a problem with mixed fisheries within the pelagic sector as there would be within the whitefish sector.  To have the time period begin from 2015 gives three years to allow for the discards measures to take effect for all species in the whitefish sector, which is very important.  It will give that room for developments to take place and for technical measures to be introduced in regard to mesh sizes and so on, so we can see what actually works and what can help to reduce the level of discards.</P>
        <P>I am slightly concerned about the fact the Commissioner has agreed additional quota will be provided, although this was said to be a concession.  While this has to happen and is welcome, I wonder how it will be policed during this transition period.  If fishermen get additional quota, will they be penalised through the enforcement concerning the discards and the technical measures if they land fish over that quota?  Will we force a continuation of discarding because of that additional quota element?  We need measures that ensure all fish that come over the rail are landed and we need to find ways to ensure fishermen are not penalised.  Whether they achieve the full economic value of that fish is perhaps a method that could be used to ensure discarding is eliminated completely and that we do not force it further underground.  This would add to the scientific knowledge and the knowledge of what is working within the sector through the technical measures as well as improving the information set and the overall standard of control within the fisheries sector.  These issues need to be worked out and there will be ongoing discussions in terms of the practicalities in this regard.</P>
        <P>It has been welcomed in the House that it has been left to member states to decide whether they will participate in regard to the individual transferable quotas, ITQs.  I have previously expressed my concerns that the principle has been conceded in regard to these negotiations on ITQs.  I would foresee in future reviews of the Common Fisheries Policy increasing pressure to bring this in here.  I wonder what we would lose in terms of negotiating stance if we continuously oppose it.  Obviously, it is a negotiating process and it was the best that could be achieved from that process, and it does protect the Irish industry until the next review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  From that point of view, I would definitely welcome it and consider it vital.</P>
        <P>Aquaculture has huge potential for us.  The Minister has been very proactive in terms of the offshore proposals and trying to develop that area further.  I do not know how a regional advisory council, RAC, for aquaculture would add anything to the equation and we have our own difficulties in dealing with the Natura 2000 sites.  That is working its way through the system at present and, hopefully, over the next year or two that system can kick in and allow licensing to restart, and allow the potential for development.  Many jobs could be created in inshore aquaculture throughout the country and many companies would be in a position to avail of that if the licensing regime was sorted out.  The regional advisory councils might only add another layer of bureaucracy and control into that situation.  I do not see where the value could be in terms of aquaculture unless it is in regard to the offshore and deep water developments.</P>
        <P>The Council agreed the policy and a general approach earlier today.  As I understand it, that is the Council&rsquo;s negotiating position and we will then enter into negotiations with the Parliament on the overall shape of the CFP reform.  The Minister in his concluding remarks might expand on how that interaction with the Parliament will work and where the weighting is between the Council and the Parliament.  Is it a 50-50 approach whereby everything has to be negotiated?  In terms of a negotiating stance for the Council and Parliament, it is a very good starting position and there has been good movement in terms of the discards and the ITQs, which is positive.  The Minister might expand on how the negotiating process will work, where the weightings are and what the final shape of the CFP might look like when it is finally reviewed in 2013.</P>
        <P>It is a positive development that the Minister will be chair of the Council of Ministers during the final stages of the review.  There is no doubt he has taken a very proactive role in regard to fisheries and has a lot of knowledge in the area.  He can bring that to bear in terms of the final make-up of the CFP.  Overall, the news is positive.  There will be measures and issues to be ironed out with regard to how this will work on a practical basis.  In terms of a negotiating stance with the European Parliament, it is positive and I commend the Minister on his work in getting it this far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to answer the questions in detail and if any Deputies have specific questions, they should feel free to intervene and I will be happy to answer them.</P>
        <P>I will begin with Deputy Browne&rsquo;s comments on what Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue said this morning.  Outside of my Department, most of us involved with fishing would accept that there is nobody who knows more about the fishing industry than Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue.  He is an oracle of knowledge on all things fishing, particularly the pelagic sector but also whitefish.  I was a little disappointed to hear him say this morning that this was the wrong approach.  However, I understand where he is coming from and six months ago would have agreed with him.  His position is that we should concentrate on avoiding catch in the first place, rather than on an obligation to land catch and ban discards.  He is right, but that is not the politics of this and things have moved on since that approach was politically achievable.  At last night&rsquo;s meeting, almost every member state was adamant that we had to achieve a final date for a complete discards ban.  Otherwise they would have walked out of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>That is the politics behind this, due to the pressure coming from consumers in countries like Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and elsewhere, who refuse to accept that we cannot come up with an intelligent solution to end the practice of discarding tens of thousands of tonnes of perfectly edible dead fish.  Whether these dead fish are juvenile stock, by-catch for which fishermen do not have a quota or whether they are extra fish, the idea that we can continue pumping them back into the sea, as if in pretence that they have not been caught, and only land the amount of fish for which we have a quota, is no longer sustainable.  Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue accepts that.  What he would like is for the fishing industry to be given the chance to use technical measures to their full potential, to increase mesh size, to introduce escape panels and to introduce set-aside areas where there would be no fishing, particularly when juvenile stocks are growing.  We have some areas where we have already implemented that type of set-aside at sea and these have worked well.  There are some good examples, particularly in the Celtic Sea, of where because of good sustainable management we have seen a significant increase in both tax and quotas because the stock is very healthy there.</P>
        <P>The debate has moved on from there.  Therefore, as well as doing what Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue wants us to do, which is to introduce technical measures that will ensure we are more targeted in terms of the species and size of fish we catch, we must also have a phased introduction of an obligation to land everything that is caught.  In other words, there must be an end to discards.  We need to do the two together.  It would not have been a credible political outcome for us to put off setting a date for a discards ban and trust that we would implement sufficient technical measures to end discarding by being more targeted in our fishing.  That was not a possible solution, because things have moved on and powerful countries in the European Union, particularly Britain, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, were adamant.  Many of them were, in fact, unhappy with the final compromise that we were not just setting a clear date at the earliest possible opportunity after which there would be a complete ban on discards.</P>
        <P>The challenge for countries like Ireland, working with countries like Spain, France, Belgium, Portugal and others, was to convince the member states that if this was to work, we had to bring the industry with us.  We need to look at more technical measures, but we must also agree, in order to get a buy-in from the other member states, that we are taking a hard line and that we agree a start date and an end date by which we will have a full ban on discards or a complete obligation to land all the fish we catch in terms of commercial target species.  There are some flexibilities around the agreement that will allow for a by-catch and so on, but essentially that is what was agreed last night and that is the political reality of the Common Fisheries Policy position now.  The big change in this Common Fisheries Policy round, which did not happen but should have in previous rounds, is that there is a determination now to end the practice of discarding.  We can no longer have a situation where the European Union needs to import 70% of the fish we consume, yet we discard 40% of the fish we catch.  Nobody can defend that.</P>
        <P>Fishermen do not defend that either.  They want a solution that will allow them move away from that unacceptable situation and that is what we were trying to do.  Last night, I was determined to introduce an approach that would indicate that while we could not do it overnight, we would be able to do it over a five-year transition period.  However, in the end, the agreement was for over a three-year period.  That may change again in negotiations, but it was as far as the Presidency and member states would go last night.  I want the industry to have time and space to change radically the way in which it fishes.  It must move away from discards and become more targeted in terms of how we catch fish, through the use of technical measures, and must land what we cannot separate.</P>
        <P>If, for example, fishermen are fishing in the Celtic Sea for cod, haddock and whiting, they cannot be so targeted that they can separate the mature cod and haddock because they are a similar size and shape.  It is impossible to target those two fish and release one and catch the other.  However, it is certainly possible to be able to release juvenile fish by providing escape hatches and bigger mesh nets.  I agree with what Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue has said with regard to technical measures but I urge him and others in the industry to understand that we have reached a stage where a ban on discards must also be part of the solution, along with the more technical measures.  We have a phasing-in period now for mixed fishery or white fishery &mdash; pelagic fishery is different and more straightforward &mdash; which will give us the time and space to adopt both approaches, namely, what both consumers and Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue want.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with regard to the maximum sustainable yield, MSY, and third countries.  We are aware of what is happening to our mackerel stocks currently off the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  What is happening is a disgrace, but we have no way of forcing them to stop that overfishing, which will damage stock for everybody.  For that reason, we are trying to progress with the Commissioner efforts to get trade sanctions put in place to force Iceland and the Faroe Islands back to the negotiating table so as to reach a reasonable solution.  Such a compromise solution is available on the European Union side.  This is what we want in order to save this stock.  Otherwise, we will find in a number of years that we will have a dramatic slashing of our budget because the stock will no longer exist.  If that is allowed to happen, it will create a nightmare scenario, particularly for the north west because it is so reliant on mackerel.  It will also be a nightmare because of the financial loss as mackerel is a hugely valuable stock for the fishing industry.  We must do what we can to force a change in the overfishing practice of both Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  There is no mechanism to force third countries to respect MSY in the same way we ask our fleet to do it.  At approximately 4 a.m. today I was discussing this with the Minister from Malta, as Malta also faces a specific problem in this regard as it shares fisheries with North Africa.  Malta is being asked to respect MSY, yet it knows that the countries it shares or borders fisheries with will not implement MSY.  I am afraid we did not get a satisfactory solution to the issue last night, apart from the proposal to negotiate with third countries to try and get a better outcome.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies mentioned regionalisation.  This is an area where we have boxed clever and have got what we want, namely, that when we can achieve agreement among all member states that are fishing in our area, we can, together, change policy in that area, without having to return to the Commission.  In other words, if we want to change fishing policy in the western waters for any kind of progressive reason, we can do that if we get unanimous agreement.  The important thing for Ireland was that we did not want a situation, in regional discussions of changes, in which Ireland was against a particular change but other larger countries were for it and they could force a change in our waters that we could not prevent.  In a case in which there is not full or unanimous agreement for change, the decision goes back to the Commission, as an honest broker, and goes through the normal process of the Parliament and Council to achieve a decision on a new policy.  That is an important insurance mechanism for situations in which, for whatever reason, France, the UK and Spain decide they want to push something through in the western waters, and we are opposed to it because it is against Irish interests.  We certainly would not like to see small countries being bullied in regionalised decision-making.  We want a fallback position whereby a country can go back to the Commission and say that it does not agree with what is happening in its waters, that it requires intervention at general level, and that it will take it to the Council.  That insurance mechanism is important, and we have it in the text now, which is a good balance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens if a country goes back to the Commission, but the Commission does not agree with it?  Will the decision be imposed on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If a country goes back to the Commission, this essentially means it is going back to the European Parliament and Council, which means it can appeal to all the other Ministers.  If something unreasonable is being imposed, other countries can get involved which would not otherwise have participated in the debate.  Thus, there is a certain level of protection there.  One of the fundamental tenets of the functioning of the European Union is that the Commission is supposed to protect small member states so that debates are not dominated by large countries.  That is the whole idea.  We saw a pretty good example of that last night, when the concerns of some smaller member states were listened to.</P>
        <P>A number of countries do not like the idea of eco-labelling, which the Commission is pushing for &mdash; and Ireland strongly supports &mdash; because they import large volumes of raw fish, grade them, process them and sell them on as European-produced fish.  We would like to be able to label fish that are caught in Irish waters &mdash; including in the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and the North Sea, as well as off the west coast of Ireland &mdash; as Irish-caught fish, because we think we could build a strong and sustainable brand around that, just as we are doing for Irish beef and also for dairy products, including infant formula.  The Commission introduced an amendment to at least keep the door open for some kind of area-based eco-labelling, which would be a powerful tool for marketing Irish fish products in the future.  I would like to see that implemented, but there will be many concerns among other member states.  Getting this through will be one of the challenges for our Presidency.</P>
        <P>A number of people asked about the role of the European Parliament.  This is the first time the Common Fisheries Policy has required co-decision following the implementation of the Lisbon treaty.  It is the same for the Common Agricultural Policy.  It will be our job during the Irish Presidency to achieve a compromise agreement between the position of the European Parliament on the CAP and the CFP, which will be voted on in the autumn, and that of the Council, which now has a common position on the CFP but will not have one on the CAP until we are into the Irish Presidency.  This will make it difficult to achieve in terms of a timeline.  However, at least the Council now has a common negotiating position on the CFP.  When the Parliament votes, which it will do by the end of October or November, we will need to work with the Commission, which is supposed to act as an honest broker between the two institutions, to achieve a compromise that both sides can live with, on which we will have to vote in the Council and the MEPs will have to vote in the Parliament.  What the MEPs can do, potentially, is to produce a position which is not actually voted on in the full Parliament, and then wait for our common position, so that only one vote is required in the Parliament.  They would vote on a compromise position.  Those are the two options they have.  If they form a position that they vote on in the full Parliament, which is probably what will happen in terms of the CFP, we will then need to reach a new compromise agreement that is voted on and agreed by both Parliament and Council.  This will have to happen in the first six months of next year if a new CFP is to be in place by 2014, which is the aspiration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does each side have equal weighting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Basically, yes.  There is not really a weighting as such, because each side essentially has a veto, in that it can just not agree and therefore delay a decision.  That is why people such as Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, are so important in the European Parliament, as is Jim Higgins, MEP.  One is a full member of the fisheries committee, while the other is a substitute member.  It is also important to have Irish interests on the environment committee.  This week we put together a whole series of amendments to our common position &mdash; the kinds of amendment we were trying to get passed last night &mdash; and we have given these to our MEPs today.  In this way they can try to move the European Parliament&rsquo;s position as close as possible to that of the Council, so that we end up with an agreement that is as close as possible to the document on which we agreed last night.</P>
        <P>With regard to the all-Ireland approach, as mentioned by Deputy Ferris, I try to speak frequently to the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, MLA, about CAP and CFP.  We have a shared interest, North and South, in both farming and fishing, which is not always reflected in England.  It is normally reflected in Scotland &mdash; not always, but normally &mdash; and generally Wales is somewhere between the English position and the Scottish and Northern Ireland position.  I do not know whether this is politically correct, but when I am trying to get a better deal for Irish farmers or fishermen, as far as I am concerned I am negotiating for fishermen both North and South.  Even though my mandate is for fishermen within the Republic of Ireland, I am conscious of the fact that many interests and concerns are shared North and South of the Border.  That is why I have tried to meet representatives of farming organisations in Northern Ireland in particular and obtain a perspective on their concerns so we can try to accommodate them.  I also work with the Northern Ireland Minister, who will be trying to push the British positions on both CFP and CAP in that direction also.  It has been a constructive relationship so far.</P>
        <P>I will not go into the historical issues.  I agree with some of what the Deputies said, but not all of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister about support for producer groups in the areas of fisheries and agriculture.  Will it be monetary, or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be both.  There will be monetary support for producer groups.  This is one of the matters about which the Commission feels strongly; it wants to empower collective producer groups because that is the best way of ensuring they secure the right prices for their products.  We will see strong support for such groups.</P>
        <P>We all agree on the point about individual transferable quotas, ITQs.  There was a major sigh of relief in my Department when we found we would not have to deal with that issue.  We think we have won the battle, but I would not write it off just yet.  Some countries are adamant about mandatory ITQs because they want to deal with the problem of having fleets that are too big for their quotas.  ITQs allow them to buy up more quota, which is a way of solving their over-capacity problem.  I certainly do not want them to solve that problem at the expense of the Irish industry.  That is why we have been so defensive on that issue.</P>
        <P>I want to mention the difference between the pelagic sector and the whitefish sector.  For people who are not familiar with the industry, I will explain that there are major differences between the two in terms of management and discards.  In the pelagic sector we are dealing with a much cleaner fishery, and any discards &mdash; there should not be a huge amount &mdash; are undersized or juvenile fish, which we should be able to deal with through more targeted gear.  I believe it will be possible to introduce an obligation to land all catches in the pelagic sector from the start of 2014 onwards and I hope to work closely with the white fish and mixed fishery fleets in Ireland over a phased three to five year period to introduce an obligation to land species alongside more targeted technological measures that ensure we catch the fish that we want to market and sell.  In doing that, the stock will recover and we will see increases in our quotas.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Ireland has never had a quota to the value of &euro;750 million quota as it has this year.  The idea that we have no fish to catch is not true.  Clearly we would like to have a bigger quota and we will work towards that but we will get there by ensuring the stocks are healthy and expanding.  Ultimately we want everybody to benefit.</P>

      <sTitle>Independent Inquiries into Planning Irregularities: Motion (Resumed)</sTitle>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />denies the Government&rsquo;s excuse that no work had been done on progressing the inquiries;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />accepts that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government inherited a completed tendering process for the selection of an external panel and letters of appointment ready to be issued to members of the panel;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />dismisses the Government&rsquo;s claim that an internal review process would be more effective given that internal reviews by county managers had already been completed in response to ministerial requests;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />strongly disagrees with comments that the claims involved in the planning inquiries were &lsquo;spurious, mostly&rsquo;;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes with concern planning irregularities in other local authority areas not covered in the original inquiries such as Waterford as outlined in the recent High Court corruption case against a former Fine Gael councillor;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />regrets the failure of the Government to progress these reports over their 15 months in office;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that all of these councils under review, with the exception of Donegal, are primarily controlled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges and regrets the findings of the Mahon tribunal into certain planning matters;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises the need, in view of the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals, to re-build public confidence in the planning and political systems; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />calls on the Government to re-open independent inquiries into planning irregularities in the local authorities in question.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to make the transition from the positive debate on the Common Fisheries Policy when I am addressing the wrong Minister.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, stated that the findings of the internal review vindicated the decision of her predecessor, Deputy Penrose, not to rush headlong into appointing seven external planning consultants to embark on a costly open ended inquiry.  She was in effect asking the public to trust her Department to investigate because it would do what the independent experts cannot and would not cost a lot of money.  I recognise that we have no money but this is completely unsatisfactory.  I am surprised at the Labour Party because it would not have accepted such an approach when it was in Opposition.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the Mahon report, we cannot rebuild confidence in the planning system unless we can offer the transparency and accountability which only come with an independent inquiry.  An Taisce&rsquo;s State of the Nation report was damning of local authorities and it is interesting to note that the areas with unfinished housing estates are the same as those with vacant estates.  I agree with the president of the Irish Planning Institute when he argues that there are too many planning authorities.  This is bound to create inconsistencies in the planning system.  The Dublin planning authorities, which were the subject of the Mahon report, came out of An Taisce&rsquo;s report better than others.  That tells us something.</P>
        <P>I do not buy into the claim in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion that the decision was taken because Fine Gael and the Labour Party control particular councils.  This is a philosophy which existed for several decades whereby the construction sector dictated a development approach rather than a real planning system.  Planning should be aimed at building communities, land use and transportation planning, matching schools and community facilities to housing development and developing water and sewerage infrastructure to allow for a mix of housing and industry.  However, our system of development simply aimed to appease the construction industry, from landowners to developers and auctioneers, and this is what funded politics.  Those of us who fought for a strategic approach over the last 20 years were called every name under the sun.</P>
        <P>I do not think Fianna F&aacute;il possesses the moral authority to table this motion but I agree with most of it and, therefore, will be supporting it.  In response to a submission by the Communities for Sustainable Development in Cork, the Ombudsman produced a lengthy report which found systemic problems in the planning system.  These systemic problems will not be solved by an internal inquiry which is nothing more than a whitewash.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>The termination of these investigations directly contradicts one of the principal recommendations of the Mahon report on establishing an independent regulator who would be free from political pressure.  The Government should study the report again.  By refusing to reverse the decision to downgrade the investigation, the Government is leaving itself wide open to accusations that it is seeking to reduce autonomy and transparency in the planning system.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, that there would be blue murder in the House if this had occurred while the Labour Party was in opposition.  There are not many Labour Party Deputies in the Chamber to listen to what we are saying, however.</P>
        <P>The dogs in the street know that the property bubble was fuelled by systemic failures in planning.  If our planning system worked properly neither the councils nor the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would have anything to fear from a review.  The previous Government did not set these inquiries in motion on a whim.  The investigation into Carlow County Council was launched on foot of a damning audit which raised major concerns about the council&rsquo;s compliance with its legal obligations.  Furthermore, An Taisce has identified massive flaws in planning policy and implementation in 34 city and county councils.  Whatever one thinks of An Taisce and why it operates, does its report not warrant investigation?  I have no doubt that planning irregularities in local authorities which were not covered by the original investigation have been buried or glossed over.  A probe should also be launched into the recent planning controversy in my constituency of Waterford, where a former Fine Gael councillor was convicted of accepting bribes from a developer.  Opinion polls reveal significant support for an investigation and people have contacted me and other councillors and Deputies to demand a response.</P>
        <P>There is an onus on the Government in this regard.  The general public will not accept any attempt to shy away from these matters and there will be a heavy price to pay if further planning irregularities hit the news in the coming years given what has already been revealed by the Mahon tribunal and An Taisce.  The Government was elected on a promise that it would tackle the severe shortcomings of our system of governance.  Government Deputies said that on television and radio.  Downgrading an independent review sends a clear message that the mandate will not be pursued.  It signals to the people that the Government is content to allow the planning system to stagnate in a past already exposed by various tribunals.  Allowing that to happen is fundamentally corrupt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy Dara Murphy.  No one did more to destroy confidence in politics and planning in this country than the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  This motion has nothing to do with restoring confidence and trust in planning and politics.  As Fianna F&aacute;il seeks to leave its tarnished past behind, it sees the shortest route back to respectability as attempting to tarnish the entire political and governmental system with the filthy brush it made its own for as long as most people in the country can remember.  The Mahon tribunal vividly showed that planning corruption was a cottage industry in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and went all the way to the top.  We can trace a line from the genesis of that culture to the collapse of our economy and the difficulties our country faces.  As Fianna F&aacute;il faces the future, it suits its purposes to invoke the view that all politicians are the same.  Did they not all have their snouts in the trough?  The Mahon tribunal demonstrated that the Labour Party did not and Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s cynical attempt to spread the muck will not wash with the Labour Party or the vast majority of the public.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the review and I note the comments from the Green Party.  The recollection of its members about the design of this process leaves much to be desired and owes more to an attempt to rewrite history and revise its bitter experience in government.  It does not have any relationship with the facts.  The review is about planning processes.  It is useful and valuable but does not represent the end of the process.  There is much more to be done.  I look forward to the detailed recommendations advanced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, in terms of the changes required to the planning system on foot of the Mahon report.</P>
        <P>I spent 12 years as a member of two planning authorities acting as a responsible advocate for good, sustainable and sensible planning.  I was sometimes a lonely voice, joined only by planners, managers, town clerks and some councillors combatting a sustained feeding frenzy of proposed projects from developers, speculators and landowners who stood to make millions at the stroke of a pen.  I was astonished to open my post one morning in the run-up to the 2004 local elections and find a short note wrapped in a cheque for &euro;500 from a well-known and active local developer and landowner.  One of his sites was being considered for zoning and he stood to make a considerable profit.  At that stage, my local authority was going through the development process.  On making inquiries, I found that all of my outgoing colleagues on the council received the same note and unsolicited contribution which was designed, we were assured, to assist the democratic process.  I quickly and publicly handed back the cheque and encouraged others to do the same.  I cannot know what would have happened if I had decided not to return this unwelcome contribution.  Would the matter have come to public attention?  Would others have handed it back?  The question strikes me whether this still happens.  My story is from 2004, eight years ago.  Why would someone choose to do this, where else is this happening and how can it be stopped?</P>
        <P>There are shortcomings and flaws in the planning process and the political system.  We can do everything humanly possible to ensure our planning and political systems are free from corruption but we must also make sure that we, as citizens, select people with the necessary integrity and clarity of character to do the job people are entitled to expect of us.  It is up to all of us to expose corruption, wrongdoing, malfeasance and maladministration.  We must tighten up administration and decision-making in planning.  This does not hermetically seal the planning system.  Good officials and good public representatives will make the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Nash, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, which forms part of the programme for Government to reform and improve elements of our planning system.  Many Private Members&rsquo; motions tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party display a remarkable amnesia and brass neck when it comes to the 14 years that preceded the election of this Government.  In this instance, it shows remarkable neck and a brazen approach to the House to suggest that the Government is in some way remiss, given the performance of the previous Government and the fact that virtually every planning controversy that erupted was linked in some way to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
        <P>There is mention of restoring confidence in planning.  The most important step in restoring confidence in the planning process was to remove Fianna F&aacute;il from Government 15 months ago.  I welcome the fact that the Minister published the report of the planning review yesterday.  It is a good analysis of various aspects of our planning system.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Nash, I served as chairperson of Cork City Council&rsquo;s planning committee for a number of years.  When a person or business engages in the planning process through the local authority, there are clearly defined timelines.  It takes roughly three months for the initial planning application and then a further month.  Unfortunately, there are no timelines associated with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  From personal experience, this creates insecurity in people who wish to invest in the country and carry out various job creation projects.  When legislation is next introduced, a simple measure would be to mirror the timelines of local authorities and require An Bord Plean&aacute;la to adopt the same timelines unless there are exceptional or extenuating circumstances requiring additional time.  It is unacceptable that a company that wishes to come to the country has a defined period for being granted planning permission but it may not receive planning permission for a year or a year and a half if an appeal has been made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Many of the larger planning applications go through our local authorities and end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s report examined planning practices in seven local authorities and sets out the 12 actions at departmental and local authority levels.  I welcome that the Minister of State has committed to implementing the 12 actions, which will enhance transparency and improve consistency.  We must be careful because one of the strengths of our planning system is subjectivity.  It would be unwelcome to arrive at a point where the subjectivity of individual planners is diluted or removed.  There will always be a case where An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as an appellant forum, will overturn a certain number of planning permissions.  Looking at the ratio between the planning applications granted and the number ultimately upheld or refused by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the most accurate way of determining whether a local authority and its planners are functioning at the optimum level.</P>
        <P>My point is to welcome that the Minister of State is acting in an aggressive fashion.  She has only been in office for a short time.  I wish her well in continuing her job of re-establishing confidence in our planning system.  It is a vital component in the job of encouraging investment, work and development in our country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I support the report published yesterday by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  This report examined practices in seven local authorities and it sets out actions to be taken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and at local authority level, to implement actions to improve consistency, enhance transparency and provide greater public confidence in the planning system nationwide.</P>
        <P>Before I was re-elected to this House 15 months ago, I was an elected member of Dublin City Council for more than 30 years.  During some of that time, Dublin Corporation was controlled by Fianna F&aacute;il and I will come back to that later.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; motion notes that all of the councils which were under review, bar one, were controlled by Labour and Fine Gael.  One of the Dublin City Council planning issues being reviewed was the Se&aacute;n Dunne multistorey development in Ballsbridge and its planning permission was overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the grounds that the permission granted by Dublin City Council exceeded the height guidelines in the Dublin City Council development plan.  I fully agree with An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision in that case and I said so at the time.  The decisions to grant or refuse permission is a managerial function under the Planning Act.  To suggest otherwise is purely a party political charge.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Dunne accompanied the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, as a special guest when Bertie addressed the United States Congress during his final term as Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; motion recognises the need, in view of the Mahon tribunal, to rebuild public confidence in the planning and political systems.  This must take the prize for breathtaking brass neck, so to speak.</P>

In 1989, I was an elected councillor of Dublin Corporation and I was completely unaware of that transaction which was taking place behind the scenes.  The tribunal found that the then Minister for the Environment used the &pound;50,000 cheque for his personal benefit and that Mr. Gilmartin intended that this cheque was to be paid to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The tribunal found that Mr. Flynn corruptly sought this donation from Mr. Gilmartin for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
	<P>When I sought speaking time on Monday I did so to defend my former county council, Galway County Council, for its record on planning over the course of the years when I was a member of the council.  Thankfully, the timely publication of the planning review report on Tuesday afternoon has, in the main, rubbished the concerns of An Tasice.  While this report will be further reviewed by an external body, it is worth noting some of the statements within the report as they relate to Galway County Council.  The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is again simply not possible to agree with the claim made by An Taisce that the 25 decisions by the Board set out in the attached dossier collectively constitute an astonishing indictment of the credibility and competence of Galway County Council.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was a claim made by An Taisce based on 25 planning applications out of a total of 11,000 applications processed in that period.  The report further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">it is considered that the statistics put forward by An Taisce in support of their complaints do not of themselves suggest any deficiency in the competence of Galway County Council.  In fact, the fuller statistical picture (i.e. the rate of appeal of Galway County Council decisions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the rate of overturn of decisions by the Board) suggests strong consistency of decision making between the Council and the Board.  Similarly, it is impossible to conclude from the 25 cases cited that Galway County Council has systematically disregarded the provisions of its own development plan, its obligations under EU or national legislation or the submissions made by other agencies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to an important finding of the report:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is considered that there is no evidence to support An Taisce&rsquo;s suggestion that individual officers of Galway County Council, including the County Manager, should be investigated.  This is a very serious matter which, particularly in the context of the recent Mahon report, has the potential to unfairly tarnish and undermine the reputation and standing of personnel within the County Council.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I condemn the assertion made by An Taisce and I support the findings in the report regarding the officials of Galway County Council.  The council has 30 members and from my experience as a member of the council, members work well together in the interests of their constituents.  Fine Gael and Labour, together with independents, socialists, Sinn F&eacute;in and former members of the Progressive Democrats, have worked together to provide a majority control from 2004 to the present day, in two different pacts on Galway County Council.  Non-members of these pacts, mainly Fianna F&aacute;il members, worked well on decisions and in general, with the exception of budgetary matters, there were very few rows on the council.  Therefore, I find it difficult to understand the relevance of the reference in the Fianna F&aacute;il notice of motion regarding the controlling role of the council.  The role of the majority on the council is to ensure a budget is passed and to elect the mayor or chairman.  Councillors have no role in planning decisions, save for material contraventions, of which there are few and all EU and national legislation was clearly outlined to members during the preparation of the county development plan.  I do not recall any great divisions between any of the parties on the council with regard to the county development plan or on the preparation of local area plans.</P>
        <P>There were frictions in the preparation of the county development plan with regard to EU designations being implemented or inserted into the county development plan.  All members were of the view that the EU had too much influence on policies.  However, on the advice of the manager and the director of services for planning, all relevant legislation was inserted into the plans, including the production of an appropriate environmental assessment.  In Connemara, where I served as a councillor, over 75% of the land mass, excluding afforested land, is designated under EU regulations and there will always be friction between designations and the wishes or the views of members of the local authority and the right of local people to live within their own communities.</P>
        <P>In one case, a small rural-based industry applied for planning permission to extend its premises in order to grow and create employment.  This was granted by the county council but was refused on appeal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The argument by An Taisce was that this business should close down and relocate to a zoned area within a neighbouring town.  Most members of a local authority would be of the view that local small business should be permitted to expand.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the report and I condemn the suggestions of untoward behaviour by members of Galway County Council or officials of the council, as cited by An Taisce and I sincerely believe that the external report and review will uphold the findings of the planning report.  There has been concern within Galway County Council that the reputation of the planning authority was damaged by the actions of An Taisce in reviewing only 25 out of 11,000 planning applications.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fianna F&aacute;il motion is both opportunistic and simplistic.  It is aimed at tarnishing everyone in order to dilute the findings of the Mahon report.  It is full of red herrings and the issues raised in the motion are different from the ones covered by the Mahon tribunal.  The Mahon tribunal found specific wrongdoings by some individuals who were basically motivated by profit.  There were also councillors who acted in their own self interest to help those people, rather than their constituents.  Some of those people were from Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>In responding to what happened in the Mahon tribunal, local democracy should not be the scapegoat.  There are many good councillors, including from Fianna F&aacute;il.  Instead of tabling this kind of opportunistic motion, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s job should be to take on board the findings of the Mahon tribunal concerning the actions of its own councillors in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>That party should defend democracy and not try to paint everybody with the same brush, because that serves Fianna F&aacute;il badly and does not help to protect democracy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The planning issue that has not been highlighted either by the United Left Alliance or Sinn F&eacute;in is that some people can still become very rich from rezoning decisions.  If that aspect of planning is not addressed it will happen in future as well.  In order to address that matter, the Kenny report needs to be implemented.  If that were done, when land is rezoned for residential and other developments local authorities could purchase it for its agricultural value plus 25%.  That is what was recommended in 1973 by the Kenny report and it is required now.  If it had been done earlier, we would have a very different landscape both politically and in terms of the developments that have occurred.</P>
        <P>I have already criticised one proposal in the Mahon report.  On the one hand, it found that planning powers have been too centralised in the hands of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, while the same paragraph recommends that those powers should be handed over lock, stock and barrel to an independent planning regulator.  The report goes further in handing that regulator even more powers, including what I would consider to be legislative ones.</P>
        <P>We know from our history and from recent findings in the reports of tribunals, that unelected officials are just as capable of having corrupt officials among them.  There is an idea that an elected official is worse but at least an elected official is accountable to the electorate.  People should be held accountable at the ballot box for democratic decisions.  It is important that planning powers remain in elected hands and that local communities have a say in what is done in their areas.  Local people have something to say on matters that affect them.</P>
        <P>I also wish to criticise the response by An Taisce to the Mahon tribunal report.  An Taisce&rsquo;s instincts are &mdash; like the Green Party&rsquo;s &mdash; profoundly anti-democratic.  An Taisce proposed, for example, a reduction in the number of planning authorities and, instead, a further centralising of planning decisions.  One aspect of the wrong planning decisions that were taken in the Dublin County Council area in the period covered by the Mahon tribunal report was that councillors from Swords were making planning decisions about Tallaght.  They could then hide behind the fact that they were not local councillors and could never be held accountable by the local electorate.  We should therefore not centralise planning any further.  We need to retain local democracy and strengthen it, as well as making it more participative.</P>
        <P>The motion before us does not serve the kind of debate we need to have on planning.  It is a knee-jerk reaction which says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s spread the blame as widely as possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make outrage about everything&rdquo;.  Instead, however, we should be asking why particular things were done and why they happened.  To that end, the Kenny report needs to be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertDowds"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
	<P>I entirely agree with my colleague, Deputy Joanna Tuffy.  She and I have the distinction &mdash; if that is the right word to use &mdash; of living in the area which has probably been most adversely affected by bad planning decisions in the State.  We have what was meant to be a town centre for Lucan-Clondalkin, which is not in the centre but very much off-centre.  I am referring to the Liffey Valley shopping centre, which should have been about 1.5 miles south west of there so that it could have served properly the new communities that were developing both in Clondalkin and Lucan.  That did not happen, however, because of the abuses that were investigated by the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>While it is right for Fianna F&aacute;il, as an opposition party, to try to keep the Government on its toes concerning any issue, including planning, it amazes me that this motion can be brought before us.  There are so many practical examples of bad planning.  I have mentioned the town centre not being a centre, and it will never be possible for it to be such.  We also have a railway station which was supposed to be in the centre of the whole area, which is actually surrounded by the one area of open land that is left in that state.  It is yet another example of appalling planning, which came about because of the behaviour of Fianna F&aacute;il councillors who were, sadly, supported by considerable numbers of Fine Gael councillors, though not all.</P>
        <P>The report that was issued yesterday is not another Mahon tribunal report.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, for issuing it and I have no doubt that she will act upon it.  She has listed a series of recommendations that will commence immediately.  Most of those recommendations do not relate to what councillors are involved in; they relate more to inadequacies in the operation of planning departments in various councils.  It is right that those should be focused on.</P>
        <P>It is important to use these debates to do two things: first, to focus on local government reform and, second, to try to improve the state of politics.  Trying to spread dirt on the subject does not help any of us.</P>
        <P>Many serious local government issues are not dealt with by this review because it is narrowly focused.  We should examine the whole area more widely, however.  Developers give development levies to county councils when they construct an estate.  They are very important to councils in order to deliver infrastructure.  The council in my area has benefitted considerably from such levies but they have a potentially corrupting influence.  I have no reason to believe that any council officials or councillors have benefited financially in any way from such a situation but there is a temptation for councils to decide to allow a development to go ahead because of the money it will bring in for them.  That is not necessarily a good basis on which to make a decision.  The decision should be based on whether a development is appropriate and useful for the area, rather than being influenced in any way by the fact that it will bring in money that will help the council to deliver services, which of course are important.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret I must ask Deputy Dowds to conclude.  We are over time.  The next speaker is Deputy Michael Kitt, whom I understand is sharing time with Deputies Calleary, Troy and McConalogue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Deputy Niall Collins for tabling this motion.  Many speakers have spoken about the need for confidence in the planning system and for us to learn from past mistakes, of which there were many.  If there is confidence in the system, there should be no fear of inquiries, which has, in part, been the reaction down through the years when inquiries were undertaken.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s report and support the proposal that it be forwarded to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht in order that recommendations can be made.  In spite of the fact that politicians do not make planning decisions, they have a bad name in respect of planning issues.  Bad decisions were made in respect of zoning, a culture which led to over-supply in many parts of the country, which, in turn, affected water quality and supply.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the intervention of former Minister, Mr. Gormley, with some councils.  Former Minister, Mr. Eamon Ryan, referred this morning to the madness of some county development plans.  It is now two years since the summer of 2010 when the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Gormley, announced a review.  That review has been going on a long time.  There is a need for some progress to be made on these reviews.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear the comments last night and tonight about An Taisce, which has referred to the need to appoint an independent regulator in the planning system, a point taken up by many environmental correspondents.  We are all familiar with the good work done by An Taisce in terms of green flags in schools and blue flags on beaches.  In An Taisce&rsquo;s State of the Nation: A Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Planning System 2010-2011 Galway City Council did very well but Galway County Council did not do too well.  It states that while Galway city fared best the county&rsquo;s failure to properly control where housing development took place placed an incredible burden on the city.  I do not agree with that.  Galway City Council and Galway County Council are separate housing authorities, as is Ballinasloe town in the county.  While I would welcome consultations between those bodies, it is up to each of them to make their decisions.  While there were difficulties in the county in terms of decisions not being made in the best interests, it was not all about the city.</P>
        <P>On unfinished housing estates, we need to build on the initiative taken by former Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Penrose.  On rural housing &mdash; I live in a rural area &mdash; I regret that rural housing has been abandoned.  I say this as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on this issue.  I note that this year Galway County Council has received funding for only a handful of rural housing, possibly two or three.  The people concerned are living in poor housing conditions and wish to live in rural Ireland.  Mistakes have been in regard to development on flood plains and low lying land, which again is evident in my own county.  One knows there are problems when people have to be relocated, as happened in the 1990s and may happen again as a result of the 2009 flooding.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Kyne&rsquo;s comments on the 25 applications in Galway which were investigated between 2007 and 2009, the bulk of which were overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I understand that the appeal rate was 4%, which is half the national rate.  As a result the Department did not support the complainants&rsquo; assertions.  Some 11,000 applications were dealt with by Galway County Council at that time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the intention to appoint an independent consultant.  However, I would go much further and appoint a permanent watchdog.  Mr. Frank McDonald states in an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> that a planning watchdog is unlikely to be appointed.  That is his view.  I would be disappointed if that were the case.  We must reopen the independent inquiries and build confidence in the planning process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, for giving us the opportunity to have this debate.  We had two days debate following publication of the Mahon report.  Much of the focus of that debate and in other fora was on the personalities involved in the Mahon tribunal, the amount of money involved and the disciplinary action that followed.  No one focused on the recommendations on planning.  I say that in the context of 99% of public representatives who have served in a council chamber or in this House having done so in the best interests of their communities.  It is unfortunate that the remaining 1% have sullied all of our names and reputations.  Some 99% of officials in all local authorities are good.  I say that in the context of my daily dealings with officials in Mayo County Council and the three town councils.  We are lucky to have them.  They are far-seeing, decent and work 24/7.  However, we need to have a full discussion on planning and where it is going and to reflect on the many mistakes made in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I remind people of the noughties when the biggest issue facing us was getting people a house.  While many of the planning decisions made at that time are now considered to have been mad, the biggest issue then facing public representatives and of public debate was the shortage of housing units.  People could not get a house or were paying bizarre amounts of money for one.  It must be remembered that that debate was going on at a time when many of the decisions, which are now being criticised in the context of where we are now, were being made.  We must be conscious of this in the context of all future decisions.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties of the Mahon report, and of any other reports which are published on this issue, is the focus on personalities and councils involved.  We need to bring the debate back, as was done to some extent by Deputies Tuffy and Dowds, to the consequences for those people living in the communities involved.  For instance, we have a serious problem in terms of unfinished estates.  The only good thing to come out of this debacle was the household charge, which because of the manner in which it was handled by the Department, means we now have a register of so-called unfinished estates.  Now that we have it, the work commenced by former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, which the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, is now continuing, to complete these unfinished estates can begin.  That register, in conjunction with SOLAS and the local employment agencies, can be utilised to finish these estates.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dowds mentioned development levies, which councils used as revenue during the so-called boom times.  What was done with that revenue in some areas is questionable.  This initiative &mdash; I acknowledge that councils are currently under enormous pressure &mdash; could be funded by a levy on councils which were paid development levies.  Some councils spent that money on gleaming headquarters and others spent it on infrastructure projects.  However, the original intention of the development levy was that it would be spent on facilities in an area rather than on homages to architects and so on.  We need the councils, as well as Government, to take responsibility for this initiative.</P>
        <P>I facilitated an initiative in an unfinished estate where luckily the bond was still in place.  While the amount available was not enough to finish the work, many of the residents who were skilled carpenters, brick layers and so on, got together with council labourers and finished it.  We are looking at doing this in other areas where the bond can still be spent.  Unfortunately, for many estates the bond is gone.  There are tens of thousands of unemployed crafts people in this country and hundreds of unfinished estates.  If we knock together a few heads in the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Social Protection these two needs can be met in a relatively cost effective manner.  Much of the commentary and ding dong of the past two evenings has been about officials, councils and what is a proper planning authority.  Everybody is agreed we have too many planning authorities in the State but let us not throw out the baby with the bath water by centralising in into one superquango answerable to nobody, which, quite frankly, is a bit like what An Bord Plean&aacute;la is at present.  Nobody can question its decisions.  If one wants to appeal a decision of An Board Plean&aacute;la one must take a judicial review and who has the money to do this?  While I respect it must be independent, it must also be accountable as a State agency.</P>
        <P>Some people, and I include the previous Minister, would like us to live in a planning ivory tower where everything is perfect and laid out wonderfully and we all live close to where we are supposed to live.  However, this is Ireland, which is a rurally-based country with a settlement pattern dating back hundreds of years which does not lend itself to ivory tower-style planning policies.  We must be realistic about this and we must be fair to people who choose to live in rural areas and want to have facilities.  They are willing to pay for these facilities and do so dearly through levies and charges.  The notion that everybody should live in a town and travel to the country at weekends is wrong and should be knocked on the head.  However, it is what some people would like us to do.  In other debates we discuss the closure of schools, the withdrawal of services and rural school transport because in many counties people do not get the chance to live in rural areas because of policies made in ivory towers where everything is perfect.  Fortunately, as politicians we live in the real world and we must try to represent people.</P>
        <P>The notion of centralising into one planning authority which decides everything for the country is wrong.  There needs to be local input.  However, at present too many local authorities are involved in planning.  Town councils are fighting with county councils and city councils are fighting with county councils about land, as the Minister of State knows better than anybody.  This does not make for a good government and certainly does not make for good planning.  I hope when Minister publishes his review of local government he will face up to this.</P>
        <P>I have been listening to other speakers in the debate and it seems just because we proposed something on planning all hell and damnation was unleashed upon us from the other side of the House.  We are the only party, along with Fine Gael, to take disciplinary action against everybody mentioned and cited in the Mahon report.</P>

If heads are knocked together in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection, surely a scheme can be put together to ensure this happens.</P>
        <P>As Deputies Dowds and Tuffy mentioned, communities are without facilities.  Perhaps now that we have a register of unfinished estates the next central project to address the issue will be an audit of education, transport and retail facilities in communities such as those in Dublin Mid West so we can start working on putting these facilities in place now, when it may be easier to do so than it will be in a few years time and than it was previously.</P>

In doing so I acknowledge mistakes were made in the past and we have had the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals.  For my part I am deeply ashamed and embarrassed of people associated with my party who were named in the reports.  As my colleague, Deputy Calleary, stated swift and comprehensive action has been taken by the party to deal with this.</P>
        <P>I want to follow on from a point made by Deputy Calleary.  I will not be crucified for the sins of my father or my forefathers.  I have a democratically elected mandate to be here as a Deputy for the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, and I am an Opposition spokesperson.  It behoves all of us to hold the Government to account and the planning process is an extremely important issue on which we must hold the Government to account.  Freedom of information requests have shown that despite what Ministers and backbenchers have stated, work had already started on establishing independent inquiries into the named counties.  It is a pity that one of the first acts of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was to shelve it.  I acknowledge that on foot of this debate being tabled the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who is in the Chamber, brought forward a list of 12 recommendations on what she will do.</P>
        <P>Mistakes were made by members of all political parties and none and we need to learn from these mistakes.  I want to concentrate on those who have really suffered because of the disastrous decisions, namely, those in communities left bereft of much needed facilities, those in unfinished housing estates, and the many small businesses in small towns suffering because bad planning allowed big supermarkets to develop on the far outskirts of towns and ripped the heart out of town centres.  I am glad that Westmeath County Council, of which I was a member, fought tooth and nail to prevent a big multinational supermarket develop on the outskirts of a town which would have decimated the town centre.  Small businesses find it difficult enough to survive in the recession without having to compete with huge businesses on the outskirts of towns.</P>
        <P>The one benefit of county development plans is that democratically elected councillors have a say in them.  When I stood in the local elections for the first time in 2004, one of the biggest issues in County Westmeath was the difficulty for people to build one-off rural houses.  It is very important for the future sustainability of rural Ireland that we ensure people bred, born and reared in an area who will contribute to the local community and are entitled to build a house there can do so, and we did this in County Westmeath.  As my colleague has said, it is only by allowing development in rural areas that we will have the people there to sustain the services, which, unfortunately, the Government seems determined to take away.  It wants to close our one and two-teacher schools and our rural Garda stations, and impose septic tank charges.  There is a raft of proposals representing a direct attack on rural areas.</P>
        <P>We need to focus on how we can make a difference to the people who lost the most from the poor planning decisions, who are those without services in their communities and living in unfinished housing estates.  One of the last things the former Government did was to allocate money to local authorities to help them move into unfinished housing estates and introduce critical safety measures in order to at least make the estates safe for the families living there.  We should consider doing more of that.  The management team from Longford County Council recently made a presentation to an Oireachtas committee on the works it has carried out in the past 18 months on which I commend it.  The difference after those top class works was unbelievable.  A small amount of money can make a big difference to the aesthetics and safety these housing estates, and more importantly to the people who are living there and paying big mortgages.</P>
        <P>I have no hesitation in speaking on the matters about which I feel strongly.  The time has come for Government Deputies to stop telling us we cannot afford to speak about what was done previously by members of our party.  The 19 of us in this Chamber were democratically elected to serve our constituency and the country.  We have offered and will continue to offer constructive opposition.  We will hold the Government to account where we feel it needs to be held to account.  We have offered meaningful solutions to the many problems people are facing on a daily basis.</P>

	<P>I commend Deputy Niall Collins on tabling the motion, covering many important planning issues.  There have been failures in planning in the past and it is important to have a well-regulated and transparent system in the future.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for being here today.  In particular, I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan back to the political fray.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>His absence during the referendum campaign was frequently remarked upon in Donegal where he is a well-known figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>He is less known now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>I noted with amusement that at ten o&rsquo;clock on the night of the referendum as soon as the polls were closed, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, was back with his announcement on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>Opposition politics was considerably less interesting when the Minister was on his short sabbatical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was cleaning up another mess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Deputy stick to the motion, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was also suitably energised by his referendum break and has been going at it with gusto in recent weeks.  Reform will be an important part of the Government&rsquo;s work during its term in office.  From the point of view of the Ministers, Deputies Hogan and Shatter, it is a good job the Government has not been as active in holding referendums as often as it promised because otherwise the two of them might have had even more extended breaks.  Jesting aside&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are winning anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>It won, indeed, and it was a well-fought campaign and an important decision for the country.</P>
        <P>I return to the point I made about the appetite among the public for reform at the time of the general election.  The two parties in Government created that hunger with the platform they put forward in promising reform if elected to government.  However, what has been achieved so far has been a grave disappointment.  We had many policy mistakes in the past and our political system failed to signpost some of the challenges that would come down the road.  It certainly failed in pinpointing a growing problem in the banking sector, which is a large part of the issue we need to address now.  In the past our political system failed in how we dealt with our planning systems.  The Mahon and Moriarty tribunals represent two very costly examples of how planning was mishandled in the past and how it corrupted the political system owing to a lack of regulation and a lack of clear guidelines.</P>
        <P>When the Minister came into office, the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals were nearing completion and independent investigations had been set up into the local authorities by the former Minister, Mr. John Gormley, as outlined in tonight&rsquo;s motion.  Instead of taking an approach of transparency, trying to reform the system and ensuring nothing was left covered up, the Minister&rsquo;s first action, unfortunately, was to close down those independent investigations that had been initiated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They had not started.  Nothing was closed down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>Freedom of information requests have been submitted since the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that nothing had started which showed that work had started on that.  Instead of pursing this the Minister set up internal audits, which had been undertaken even before the former Minister, Mr. Gormley, ever got to the stage of launching independent investigations.  It was a very poor start if the Government wanted to ensure nothing was left covered up or even the appearance that something might be covered up.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to go down the route of an independent investigation.  The report published by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, indicated it was acceptable to have internal audits in respect of issues that may have arisen.  However, when it comes to implementing the 12 reform points, she considers it necessary to bring in a consultant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I announced I was appointing an outside person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but only to oversee the reforms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>It was acceptable to have an internal audit to assess whether there was a problem in the first place, of which one would imagine it would be most important to have an outside person take charge.  However, now when it comes to implementing the reforms, the Minister of State is bringing in outside consultants.  In the interest of moving on and ensuring that no question is left over decisions taken in any of these local authorities, an independent investigation should be held.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise how this relates to the wider issue of real reform.  We need to reform our system to ensure the way we do business is open and gives the best type of government for the public.  The Minister&rsquo;s actions so far on political reform have seen him row back on the number of Deputies he plans to cut for the next D&aacute;il.  That was not really reform because it was simply tinkering at the edges.  There has not been anything significant in that regard.  We have also seen no movement on Seanad reform.  Again, simply putting forward a motion to abolish that body is a very simplistic way of trying to show action, but it does not make any change to the way our political system operates.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Collins on this motion and ask the Minister to do the right thing and conduct independent investigations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by thanking Fianna F&aacute;il for this gift of a Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Somebody should tell them that it is the role of the Opposition to oppose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is a gift.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Parties do this by highlighting what they see as the shortcomings of incumbent Governments.  Opposition parties do not normally raise issues for debate that draw attention, yet again, to the rampant evasion, corruption and duplicity that existed at the highest levels of their party.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister has started very well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I was a member of Fianna F&aacute;il and I wanted to make this Government uncomfortable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The Moriarty tribunal, for example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I would steer well clear of planning.  Fianna F&aacute;il should probably also avoid debates on whether it is plausible that a Minister for Finance would not have a bank account, how a modestly paid Taoiseach can afford to own an island, if a win on the horses is enough to explain away Byzantine complexity in somebody&rsquo;s personal finances or the catalogue of decision making that characterised what happened in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>

	<P>What about big extensions for Ministers&rsquo; houses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies tried once more, with the help of Sinn F&eacute;in, to create a smokescreen to deflect attention from their appalling record on planning.  Deputy McGrath was a member of Fianna F&aacute;il as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>With goldfish-like memories, they have already expunged the criticisms so damningly levelled at their party by the Mahon tribunal.  The Government has not forgotten and will not forget.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Mahon report was delivered in March, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has seized on the planning review, which was initiated when it was in office but was not followed through, as a means to deflect attention from the fact that during its time in government it rode roughshod over proper planning and sustainable development at local and national levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Cheered on by Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I prefer to take the time this evening to focus on the report and not waste more time rehashing the litany of planning catastrophes for which Fianna F&aacute;il has been responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is wasting a lot of time waffling around in circles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The starting point for the review dates back to June 2010 when the then Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, announced an independent review involving seven local authorities.  When he left office more than seven months later, he had still not commenced the reviews.  What he had done was issue a request for tenders for the carrying out of a review and issue letters to potential panellists regarding provisional appointment to a panel of planning experts pending confirmation of certain conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the timeline.  The Minister should tell us what he is doing about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>He left office in January 2011 before appointing a single expert.  It must be made clear that the suggestion that he had instigated an independent investigation before he left office and that this was subsequently downgraded is not the case.  However, that does not suit the argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not here to defend himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McGrath is due to speak next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to get the facts correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect even to suggest that he had investigations in mind in the first instance.  His announcement in June 2010, when he was in government with Fianna F&aacute;il, referred to a planning review, not an investigation.  His proposed review had not been commenced.  It was intended to be a review rather than an investigation.  No contract had been awarded, no preferred tenderer had been selected and former Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s successor, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, did not progress the matter further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the speech the Minister of State gave last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The seven authorities had been selected by John Gormley, he had set the parameters for the review and he had selected the issues in each case to be reviewed.  He did nothing more.  Our rigorous review, which was carried out by the Department and which we will now subject to full independent scrutiny, showed no evidence whatsoever of corruption or malfeasance.  The decision made by the former Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, which I supported and which was followed through by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, proved to be prudent and correct.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies should note that nobody in this Government stopped any inquiries.  We will act decisively, rather than do nothing, on the issues at stake at present.  It is being described as a whitewash by Deputy Niall Collins.  It is either a very long, fully transparent, detailed and comprehensive whitewash, or perhaps it is a fair and balanced analysis of the issues originally brought to John Gormley&rsquo;s attention, and on which the Deputy said nothing at the time.  The reception the report has received in certain quarters would suggest that some people would prefer the Government to plant evidence on the planning authorities involved, point to this and have seven county managers put in stocks on trumped-up charges.  We are not prepared to do that.</P>
        <P>The report states clearly that it is not giving a clean bill of health to the entire planning system.  It concludes, however, that in these seven cases there is no evidence of wrongdoing.  We do not make the claim that wrongdoing will not be found anywhere in the planning system.  Thanks to the conduct of many people over the last couple of decades, it will be some time before anybody can make that claim.  The planning review has identified areas of policy and practice which, quite bluntly, do not measure up.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, has stated her intention to act swiftly on these, and I will support her in her work.</P>

	<P>No, he has enough to say too.  We have to rebut all those allegations.  Even though I am not a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, I hate to hear spurious claims made about a party I was proud to belong to for many years.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, because she is a reasonable person.  Unfortunately, the man beside her is not a reasonable person and has not shown himself to be reasonable in any policy he has introduced, such as the bungled water services Bill, which he still has not introduced but which he promised he would do in Clonmel many months ago.  He then promised a fiver Monday, to get away slightly from the motion, when one could register for a fiver.  That registration process is not working even now.  It is shameful.</P>

	<P>I am trying to discuss the planning, a Cheann Comhairle, but it was very hard to listen to that diatribe for the last five minutes.  It distracts one completely from what one wishes to say.</P>
        <P>One need go no further than Dungarvan to see who was involved in the planning scandal.  It is down the road from the Minister.  He need go no further than the Moriarty tribunal report to see what happened.  He has a brass neck to allege all these things about other parties.  I know that people in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and in other parties and other individuals were involved in unsavoury practices, but the Minister did not go very far and did not look in the mirror to find out where they were and what they were doing.  He promised much reform before the last election, as did the Labour Party, but all we got was a change of personnel in this Chamber.  They just swapped seats and went off to see Angela <i>et al</i> and bowed down and listened to them before obeying and asking how high to jump.</P>
        <P>The former Minister, former Deputy Gormley, had initiated investigations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>He had not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ministers can spin it whatever way they wish but they were initiated.  They can ask his colleague, Eamon Ryan.  Mr. Gormley has retired from politics and is not here to defend himself.</P>
        <P>Big Phil arrived in and told the lads in Carlow-Kilkenny: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.  We will put the foot down on them and make sure there will be no more about that.  That is okay in other counties but it cannot happen in Carlow-Kilkenny.&rdquo;  The same happened with the recommendations about the constituency boundaries.  Carlow-Kilkenny is untouched.  He spent &euro;1 million to save money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will you get away from the constituencies?  We are talking about planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a fact.  This is what the Minister is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no report produced yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He is like a train or a steamroller that cannot be stopped.  A sum of &euro;1 million can go into Waterford city instead of offices for Kilkenny County Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in Kilkenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in County Kilkenny.  I accept that.  I know my geography.  It is hanging into Waterford.  If there was any type of tremor, it would fall into it.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  However, that is the way he wishes to behave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has one minute left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>One is enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said in respect of the Mahon tribunal and others, they are there for the Government to act on.  In the same way, it could not make time available this week to discuss another issue of the House, which the Ceann Comhairle had rightly rejected under his own Standing Order.  I believe the Government could have given time, had it so wished but it might not suit it because things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Deputy, what has this got to do with the motion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to the cavalier way in which the Minister addressed the motion tabled by Deputy Niall Collins, whom I compliment on tabling this motion.  To take a lecture from the Minister, Deputy Hogan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy still a member of Fianna F&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy does not know what he is a member of, b&iacute; ci&uacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Deputy, I now call on Deputy Niall Collins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  In summary, the debate has been quite a useful exercise in which Members have engaged over the last two evenings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Until the last speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Members were going well until then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in a discussion on planning.  It intrigues me to observe how Labour Party Members in particular are quite uncomfortable when discussing planning.  I will go into further detail in a few minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a bit uncomfortable in discussing planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have described what the Minister of State published yesterday as a whitewash and I do so for the following reasons.  She has come up with 12 recommendations and I will provide a flavour of some of them.  She mentions material contraventions and consolidation of the planning Acts.  She refers to reminding local authorities of the need to review policies regularly, to communication, to planning policy and to the holding of town hall meetings.  All this sort of stuff should be taking place in any event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were the specifications of the former Minister, Mr. Gormley.  He issued them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Minister, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The executives of local authorities should be doing this each day of the week.  The point is that a number of complaints were made that had a degree of substance and coming up with 12 recommendations and asking someone independent to implement recommendations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I am asking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when an independent person should be holding such inquiries.  That is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are implementing the recommendations.  The independent person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>She has consistently sought&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Minister, would you please refrain from across-the-floor discussion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is misrepresenting me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You must go through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to get away from the fact that there were inquiries ready to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the Chair, the Deputy is misrepresenting me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Letters of appointment were ready to issue and all the Minister of State had to do was to push the green button in this regard.  There has been a consistent theme in this debate, namely, a policy of the parties in government to try continually to rubbish the Green Party and to rubbish John Gormley&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il did that themselves for long enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in respect of planning policy.  If there is anything one can say about John Gormley and the Green Party, it is that they have high standards in respect of planning policy.  This charge has been led by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who has just happened to leave the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has changed his tune.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has left to attend a Cabinet sub-committee meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>One should consider his track record and his credibility because he continually calls into question John Gormley&rsquo;s credibility.  He campaigned against the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>He went around the country, spoke at public meetings and promised to reverse it.  However, when he entered office, he commenced the legislation.  Similarly, he opposed the Wildlife (Amendment) Act relating to the Ward Union stag hunt.  He went around the country and told every group, including RISE!, that Fine Gael would reverse it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>What has this to do with planning?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to the credibility of the man who was sitting beside the Minister of State a few minutes ago.  He will say one thing when in opposition but will say another and will act completely differently when he is in government.  The point is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, the Deputy is impugning the reputation of someone who is not present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>While he could have remained here, he ran out the door.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>He has a Cabinet sub-committee meeting to attend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is a number of complaints were made to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department by the Office of the Ombudsman and the local government auditor.  These were not spurious complaints lodged by people from the sides of the streets or by a couple of cranks.  They were made by reputable organisations and the Minister, who has left the Chamber, has conveniently sought to try to rubbish some of the complaints that were made in this regard.  I note the Minister of State becomes very uncomfortable when the facts are pointed out to this House.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have the majority of the membership of more than two thirds of local authorities nationwide but continue to default back to the Mahon report, which pertains to events back in 1992, a time when most of the younger members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party had barely completed their leaving certificate exams.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s lineage in Fianna F&aacute;il is well known.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the aforementioned two parties, along with all other local authority members nationwide, grossly over-zoned land.  I do not make this point for the benefit of Members in the Chamber but for the benefit of those outside who may be listening.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party were party to the building up of the property bubble.  They were party to the building up of the complete oversupply of zoned land in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that a Fianna F&aacute;il Member is saying this is incredible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Moreover, it is a fact that enough land was over-zoned in Ireland to build 1.5 million houses.  When one is a member of a local authority, as were members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and my own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Deputy&rsquo;s party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;one is involved in making development plans and local area plans in which one zones land.  The Government parties display a complete absence of responsibility for the local authorities they control because they do not wish to recognise and accept they played a significant part in over-zoning the supply of land, which helped to build up the property bubble.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who was responsible for it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.  Another point worth noting is the Minister of State did an interview on RTE radio with Mary Wilson yesterday, in which she referred to Fianna F&aacute;il, the Mahon report and criminality in the same sentence.  When she was challenged on it, she withdrew it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I withdrew it in respect of criminality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>However, if the Minister of State wishes to talk about criminality, what has she to hide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>She is afraid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will turn to the position in Waterford, which was not one of the seven local authorities named.  There was a finding of corruption and criminality in the criminal courts in Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because Mr. Gormley did not pick Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that two members of my party were involved in voting for the rezoning in question.  However, my party called for and continues to call for an independent inquiry into events in Waterford and on the day it did so, the now-departed Minister stated there was no prima facie evidence for an inquiry in Waterford.  He stated this even though all the members of the local authority in Waterford were interviewed as part of a Garda investigation prior to zoning land and they still went ahead and zoned the land.  The Minister of State and the man who was sitting beside her do not think that it is in the public interest.  It is fully within the public interest that the people have a right and an entitlement to know what happened in Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason is that John Gormley did not pick Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>A serious breakdown of the system took place in Waterford and speakers in this House earlier this evening referred to this matter.  However, all the Government speakers this evening defaulted back to the Mahon report.  The Mahon tribunal covered a period up to 1992.  I refer to what has happened since then and Members opposite cannot keep defaulting away from it.  Moreover, if they wish to talk about tribunals of inquiry, Members can discuss the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il is still at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no acceptance from the Government of the day of responsibility in respect of the Moriarty tribunal.  Deputy Enda Kenny has not stated, publically, privately or anywhere that he accepts the findings of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.  That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a terrible state of affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not accurate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should stick to planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Charlie Haughey?  What about Liam Lawlor?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>While Members opposite can give a history lesson&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is sound advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is they seem to find it difficult to accept that with a mandate comes responsibility.  Responsibility has been exercised but there also has been dereliction of responsibility from the Minister of State&rsquo;s party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Deputy mean by referring to my party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;from the party with which it is in coalition, from my party and from many other people with no parties throughout the country in respect of local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a brass neck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Deputy mean by a &ldquo;dereliction of responsibility&rdquo; on the part of my party?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister of State enters this Chamber and tries glibly to connect every single incorrect decision regarding planning to Fianna F&aacute;il, it is a shallow presentation of the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is too narrow.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has a brass neck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Members are fully within their rights to call for an independent inquiry into all the irregularities in the seven named local authorities.  The Minister of State has a good reputation, which she should enhance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Minister of State to enhance her reputation and not to do the bidding of the man who was sitting beside her but who has left the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not be condescending towards me because I happen to be a woman.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>She has it within her gift to enhance her reputation and to proceed with independent planning inquiries into the seven authorities, which were ready to go.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 14 together. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November last year, demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform and the pursuit of efficiencies by deciding (i) to proceed with the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012 and (ii) the critical review of a further 46 bodies by the end of June 2012.  Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan.</P>
        <P>With regard to the progress made on the rationalisation of the 48 bodies by end 2012, my Department is monitoring progress on the implementation of these measures, on a quarterly basis.  Details of the completed actions as well as progress on the other measures, as of end Quarter 1 of this year, are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>The critical reviews of 46 bodies are underway and due for completion at the end of this month.  Following consideration of the reviews by my Department, I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government setting out the results of the review process.  The Government will then make the necessary decisions on the various recommendations / next steps in the reform programme.</P>
        <P>Questions regarding the creation of new bodies are a matter for individual Departments and should be directed to the relevant Ministers.  In terms of my own Department, no new bodies or agencies have been created since March 31 2011.  However, I have re-organised resources within my Department to set up a Reform and Delivery Office, the role of which is to lead and drive the implementation of the Public Service Reform Plan and to coordinate the various reform initiatives across the public service.</P>
        <P>I have also established, as part of the broader public service development role of my Department, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), the role of which is to support Departments in evaluating policy and expenditure options; value for money exercises; cost benefit and regulatory impact analyses; and regulatory and competition issues.  Recruitment of new economists into the IGEES has now commenced and these recruits will supplement existing economic and analytical resources across the public service.</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) Appendix 1 &mdash; Completed Actions end Q1 2012</P>

	<P>I announced the review of allowances and premia payments, to be carried out by my Department, in my address on the 2012 Expenditure Estimates on 5 December 2012.  This announcement was made on foot of a Government decision which requires the public service to take additional measures to deliver further efficiencies in 2012 so as to ensure that paybill targets are met and with a view to delivering additional pay savings in 2013 and subsequent years.  The measures include a reduction of 10% (approx &euro;40 million) in overtime payments in 2012 which is being achieved by a reduction in allocations for overtime by the necessary amount for 2012.  </P>
        <P>To date, my Department has reviewed well over 800 business cases for allowances and premia payments.  Due to resource constraints coupled with the volume of submissions received, and the complexity and variety of allowances across the sectors, it was not possible to complete the review in a short time frame.  Indeed, business cases continue to be put forward for review by Offices and Departments.  I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to the findings of the review.  In the interim, urgent business case requests are being processed in so far as is possible in order to ensure that the work of the public service is not unduly disrupted by the review.</P>
        <P>The outcomes of the Review of particular allowances will be communicated to Government Departments and will be made public.  I have also indicated my expectation that further discussions will take place with staff representative bodies.</P>

	<P>Since coming into office, the current Government has been working on a range of measures to boost employment and help stimulate economic growth beginning with the Jobs Initiative which was launched in May 2011 and which comprised a range of taxation and expenditure measures of &euro;1.8bn designed to help get people back to work.  Further work to stimulate economic growth and create employment is ongoing and, in this context, my Department has been actively engaged, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), in identifying potential new sources of funding for projects where it makes sense and offers value for money for the State.</P>
        <P>My Department undertook a review of the public capital programme last year, the results of which were published in the &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;.  The Framework sets out &euro;17 billion worth of Exchequer investment intended to address critical infrastructure investment gaps in order to aid economic recovery, social cohesion and environmental sustainability.  The sectors prioritised for investment in the Framework include education, health, jobs and enterprise.  While this represents a significant level of spend that will generate activity throughout the country, I am conscious that there is more that we could do if we had additional funding available.</P>
        <P>The Government is now considering carefully what potential further projects could be supported should a source of additional funding become available.  It is likely that such investment would be focused on areas that meet the Government&rsquo;s key investment priorities, boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.  My Department has established a high level interdepartmental steering committee which is considering potential projects for investment that meet these criteria.  Proposals from departments have been received and are being considered by officials of my Department and by the steering committee.  I am confident that a pipeline of necessary and worthwhile projects will emerge over the course of the coming weeks.  As I have already mentioned, my Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the NDFA to ensure that additional funding sources are available in order to deliver any proposed pipeline of projects.</P>

	<P>The French President&rsquo;s decision to reduce his own pay and that of his Cabinet mirrors the precedent set by this Government on entry into office in March 2011.  </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided on taking office in March 2011 to reduce the salaries of An Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ministers of State with immediate effect.  The reductions were implemented on a voluntary basis by all relevant Officeholders pending passage of the necessary legislation giving statutory effect to the reductions.  Section 6(c) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act 2011 gave a legislative basis to the pay reductions for Office holders from 1 January 2012.</P>
        <P>The gross annual salaries now applicable to An Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ministers of State amount to &euro;200,000, &euro;184,405, &euro;169,275, and &euro;130,042,  respectively.  The gross salaries indicated are inclusive of the pay element for a Deputy amounting to &euro;92,672.  Since 2008 the effect of reductions in pay and taxation changes is that the net salaries of the Taoiseach and Ministers have been reduced by over 40%.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present to review the current arrangements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 21 together. <b></b></P>
        <P>I announced last February that, following intense engagement, I had secured an agreement with the Troika that a third of the proceeds of our asset disposals programme could be used for re-investment in our economy.  This was a substantial change to the Troika&rsquo;s previous position and will help promote recovery in the economy.  I have since then secured a further agreement that 50 per cent of the total proceeds from the sale of State assets can be used for job creation and as a stimulus to our economy, the balance will be set aside in a fund that could leverage further money for investing in the economy.  As the Government has agreed with the Troika the sale of state assets up to a value of &euro;3 billion, this will mean that up to &euro;1.5bn can be used for direct investment in the economy and a further &euro;1.5bn will be retained in a fund which will attract other private investment into the State.  The Government is now considering carefully how it can use this money to maximise the return to the economy.</P>
        <P>My Department has been examining what potential infrastructure projects could be supported should any additional funding source, including the proceeds of our asset disposals programme, become available.  It is likely that such investment will be focused on areas that meet the Government&rsquo;s key investment priorities, as set out in &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;, boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.  My Department has established a high level interdepartmental steering committee which is considering potential projects for investment which meet these criteria.</P>

	<P>The House will be aware that in dealing with the EU/ECB/IMF Troika on this matter, it has been this Government&rsquo;s consistent position that funds released from asset disposals would be used to support job creating initiatives in the economy.  I am happy to report that, after long-term negotiations, I recently reached agreement with Troika representatives that all such proceeds would be used, in one shape or another, for this purpose.  Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature.  The other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to guarantee additional lending into Ireland, for example by the EIB, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.</P>

        <asker> Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to review the pay and allowances of non-commercial State agency chief executive officers; and if he intends to collate current salary and allowance data year-on-year paid out to such CEO&rsquo;s. </Quest>
        <QRef>[28253/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In June 2011, the Government introduced a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service (including CEOs of Non-Commercial State Agencies).  This pay ceiling has applied since June 2011 and continues to apply to newly appointed CEOs in the Non-Commercial State Agencies. </P>
        <P>While the policy applies to all new appointments to the position of CEO in Non-Commercial State Agencies, it could not , for contractual reasons, be applied to the current incumbents of these posts.  However, the very small number of incumbents of senior posts in the Non-Commercial State Agencies with a salary in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum were requested to make a voluntary waiver of salary of 15%, or to waive a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring their salary below the &euro;200,000 salary ceiling.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, the reductions outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act (No. 2) 2009 applied to the remuneration of public servants generally including CEOs in the Non Commercial State sector, as did the Pension Related Deduction or &ldquo;Pension levy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Access to a Performance Related Award Scheme is no longer approved for inclusion in the employment contracts of CEOs of Non Commercial State Agencies.  In terms of incumbent CEOs there are only a couple of bodies which continue, as they are legally entitled to do, to operate a Performance Related Award Scheme for an existing  CEO for the remainder of their fixed term tenure.</P>
        <P>In a very limited number of cases a car allowance may be payable to a CEO.  The issue of whether an allowance of this nature is appropriate is considered on a case by case basis as CEO vacancies fall to be filled, having regard to whether the provision of such represents value for money for the body and is more efficient than otherwise recouping travel expenses incurred by the CEO in the performance of their duties.</P>
        <P>The collation of remuneration data in respect of the CEOs of Non Commercial State Agencies is a matter that falls, in the first instance, to the relevant parent Department  in the context of the particular organisation&rsquo;s annual report.</P>
        <P>Conclusion</P>
        <P>These matters are kept under review when approving the terms and conditions for each CEO appointment.   However, the reductions which have already been achieved, whether under legislation, voluntary waiver or by the application of reduced salaries for new appointees, are significant.  Any future policy developments on the determination of remuneration at the level of CEO will have to be considered in the context of the changes that have already been introduced.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 is primarily focused on the areas of jobs, education and health.  Within the programme there is considerable emphasis on more labour intensive projects which provide greater opportunities for job creation.  This is typically demonstrated by the broad range of projects that the Department of Education and Skills are tasked with delivering which includes 40 new schools and the expansion of 180 existing schools.</P>
        <P>In undertaking a construction project, contracting authorities will normally procure the services of a competent building contractor who has the financial and technical capacity to safely deliver the project in question.  The rules governing the awarding of public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement that a certain portion of the workforce be recruited from the long-term unemployed, as a condition of the performance of the contract.  Any such provision must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.  Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, where appropriate.</P>

        <P>The ongoing provision of a fixed percentage of annual lottery turnover for good causes will be a condition of the licence.  The Government has decided that this percentage is to be retained at 30.5% which was the level that was achieved in 2011.</P>
        <P>The new licence will also involve an upfront payment to the State, with some of the payment being used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 34 together. </P>
        <P>I am happy to report that significant progress has been made on advancing the asset disposal programme that I announced last February. The House will already be aware that a number of inter-departmental working groups have been established to examine each of the assets mentioned in that announcement with a view to disposals. The NewERA unit of the National Treasury Management Agency, which is acting as the Government&rsquo;s financial advisor in respect of this disposal programme, has prepared comprehensive financial reports on Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Coillte, including detailed analysis of the market appetite for the companies or their assets, and these have been submitted and considered by the relevant Steering Groups. Work is also proceeding on identifying the electricity generation assets of ESB that are to be included in the programme.</P>
        <P>After long-term negotiations, I recently reached agreement with Troika representatives that all proceeds from disposals will be used, in one shape or another, to support job creating initiatives in the economy. Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature. The other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to guarantee additional lending into Ireland, for example by the EIB, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.</P>
        <P>Under the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme, the Government is committed to outlining in detail for the Troika, by the end of the second quarter (end June 2012), the specific regulatory, legislative, corporate governance and financial reforms which need to be taken in 2012, ensuring consistency with relevant EU legislation, where necessary, to allow for the State asset disposal programme to proceed in 2013, and a calendar with indicative timelines for sales will then be set out.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 39, 86, 87, 89 and 90 to 92, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government Programme. We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</P>
        <P>In determining fiscal policy, the Government has to take account of a wide range of often competing considerations and policy priorities.  The Government decides on the balance between these priorities in setting the broad budgetary parameters &mdash; the overall budgetary balance, taxation priorities and the aggregate levels for expenditure.  In this context, the aggregate levels of expenditure are split by reference to Ministerial vote group and the detailed disbursement of the resources within their allocation is a matter for each Minister in accordance with overall agreed Government policy.  The precise composition of the 2013 budgetary consolidation is a matter for Government, the details of which will be announced at Budget time.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s approach has been clearly set out in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i> published on 5 December last, the <i>Capital Infrastructure Plan</i> published on 10 November 2011, the Implementation Body publication of the Public Service Agreement<i> Progress Report</i> on the 17 November 2011, and the <i>Public Service Reform Plan</i>  also published on 17 November 2011.  Indeed, an updated <i>Progress Report</i> is due to be published shortly, and I anticipate further significant and tangible progress to be identified in this context.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Public Service Reform Plan</i>  is being led and coordinated by the Reform and Delivery Office which I established within my Department.  The Office is working closely with organisations across the Public Service and good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the Reform Plan.  For example, we are:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />continuing to reduce Public Service numbers which were around 28,000 lower at end Q1 2012 than they were at end 2008 &mdash; the Government is on target to meet its ceiling for 2012 of  294,400;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />expanding the use of eGovernment through the recently published eGovernment Strategy, the establishment of a CIO Council and rolling out the Public Services Card;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />reforming how we are organised by having a strong focus on business process improvement, considering innovative new business models for the delivery of non-core services, increasing the use of aggregated procurement and developing new shared services (for example, I have recently announced plans for the establishment of a Human Resources Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service);</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />reforming how people are managed through the introduction of new working arrangements, including new rosters, redeployment and workforce planning, a greater emphasis on performance management and development of the Senior Public Service; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />reforming the management of expenditure through the introduction of Performance Budgeting, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework and the new Value for Money Code.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland is living up to its commitments by delivering on all the conditions and targets in the EU/IMF Programme by the required deadlines.  The Government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to meeting the targets agreed with our European and IMF partners.</P>

	<P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question I can provide details in respect of the Office of Public Works which is under the auspices of my Department.  It would be a matter for individual departments to supply the information in respect of the associations, organisations and regulatory bodies under their aegis.  </P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has responsibility for the maintenance of the seven civil service cr&egrave;ches established under the Civil Service Childcare Initiative.  In addition to the capital and current expenditure incurred by the OPW the cr&egrave;ches are provided with rent-free accommodation.</P>
        <P>My Department retains the responsibility for any policy issues relating to the cr&egrave;ches and chairs the Board of the Initiative. The Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit of my Department is currently carrying out a Focussed Policy Assessment of the Civil Service Childcare Initiative. The question of further savings that can be made in this overall area, including as regards efficiencies in how State funding is allocated and monitored, will be kept under scrutiny.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 37 and 46 together. </P>
        <P>The Government recently decided to proceed with the implementation of a HR Shared Service Centre (HRSSC) for the Civil Service which will be operated and managed by the Civil Service.</P>
        <P>The HRSSC will carry out the transactional (administrative) elements of HR, freeing up staff in Departments, Offices and Agencies to focus on more strategic HR activities.</P>
        <P>The HRSSC will consist of a centralised function within the Civil Service that will manage the transactional elements of HR processes for the Civil Service.  Responsibility for other aspects of HR functions and for all aspects of HR decision making will remain with Secretaries General and Heads of Office and their HR units.  The overall governance framework for the HRSSC will be developed further in the next phase of the project (Detailed Design) having regard to the legislative structures contained in the Civil Service Regulations Acts 1956 to 2005 and the Public Service Management Act 1997.</P>
        <P>The HRSSC will manage a large number of key HR process areas that are very suitable to a HRSSC environment: Organisation Structure Management, Employee Administration, Pensions Administration, Training Administration and Performance Management Administration.  These processes are high volume, repetitive and transactional in nature thus making them very suitable for management within a Shared Service Centre.</P>
        <P>The Public Appointments Service will continue to manage the process of recruitment to the Civil Service and therefore recruitment is not within the scope of this project at this stage.  The HRSSC will have no direct impact on the practice of rehiring retired civil servants.</P>
        <P>It currently costs the Civil Service &euro;85.6m annually to deliver HR services to 40 bodies. It is estimated that, once fully operational, the implementation of the HRSSC will result in annual savings of &euro;12.5m. The investment costs associated with this four year project have been estimated at &euro;26 million.  These costs consist of technology, project team resources (both internal to the Civil Service and the cost of our implementation partners), data cleansing and scanning and facilities costs.</P>
        <P>This project is overseen by a Project Management Board that is accountable for project delivery, project budget and the financial appraisal of the project. The Project Team reports regularly to Board and meetings of the Board are held every 3 weeks</P>
        <P>A significant determining factor for including an organisation in the HRSSC is whether or not that organisation is currently using the single, centrally managed Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for the administration of HR services.  The existence of a common IT platform is a significant advantage in establishing any shared service centre.  The HRSSC will include 40 organisations in total including all Government Departments and a number of other Offices and Agencies, a small number of which are public service bodies.</P>
        <P>Sectoral leads have been appointed to lead delivery of Shared Services within the main sectors and the National Shared Services Office is working closely with the Sectors to guide and support them with the development of their plans (to be completed by end Q2).</P>

        <Quest> if the protocol on meetings with market participants / advisors, in the context of the announcement on the disposal of State assets includes a protective measure that ensures that the Government&rsquo;s advisers on the disposal in any capacity cannot and will not act as advisers to prospective bidders. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question notes, in the interests of transparency and as possible transactions get closer, I have issued a protocol governing meetings between Government departments and market participants/advisors in the context of the assets disposal programme that I announced in February.  All such meetings are now being coordinated by the NewERA unit of the National Treasury Management Agency, which is acting as the Government&rsquo;s financial advisor in respect of the disposal programme. </P>
        <P>The procurement of advisors to advise the Government on any transaction under the asset disposal process is a totally separate process which will be carried out, in each instance, in accordance with relevant national and EU procurement guidelines, with the design of each process taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the transaction involved.  The asset disposals will be transacted via open, transparent, and competitive processes in order to ensure that the State achieves value for any assets being sold.   I can assure the Deputy that the processes for the procurement of Government advisors will be designed in such a way as to ensure that any individual or company that is eventually engaged to advise the Government on a particular transaction under the asset disposal programme will be doing so on the basis that they cannot advise any of the prospective bidders in relation to that transaction.</P>

	<P>Public accountability requires that accounts be produced and audited within a reasonable timeframe. The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies requires that draft unaudited annual accounts for each State body should be furnished to its relevant Department and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not later than two months after the end of the relevant financial year. </P>
        <P>In response to issues raised by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding delays in account production and submission, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular to all Departments (4/2011) which highlighted the need for timely production of accounts of State bodies and funds under the aegis of Government Departments and Offices and their subsequent submission to their parent Department, along with the laying of such reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Circular 4/11 specifies a time limit of (i) one month for bodies to submit their accounts to the parent Department after the CandAG has issued his audit certificate and (ii) two months for Departments to lay the accounts of bodies before the Houses after the accounts are received by Departments. As outlined in the Circular, Departments are responsible for the compliance of all bodies under their aegis with the relevant requirements. In this context, Departments were requested to ensure that all relevant bodies under their aegis were notified of and fulfil these requirements.</P>

	<P>In the context of reporting requirements for central government and state bodies, public accountability requires that relevant accounts are produced and audited within a reasonable timeframe.  The format of these accounts and reporting requirements reflect the objectives, funding mechanisms and statutory basis of the relevant organisations.  While reporting requirements may vary, the underlying objective of public accountability remains the same.</P>
        <P>In this regard, State bodies are generally required to prepare accounts in a manner prescribed in their establishing instruments, with accrual accounting as the basis for the majority of public sector accounts.  In addition, the Code of Governance for State Bodies provides guidelines across a range of reporting requirements for state bodies.</P>
        <P>The reporting requirements for government departments and offices are related to the Estimates process and each Department or Office is required to prepare statutory accounts, the Appropriation Accounts, for any Vote for which they are responsible.  These accounts are on a cash basis, with accompanying accruals information.  With effect from the 2011 Appropriation Accounts, Department and Offices are producing balance sheets and the Appropriation Accounts 2012 will see further development in this area.  The wider issue of the move from cash based to accruals based accounts for central government is currently being examined, with particular reference to future shared services developments in the financial management area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A three month notice period was introduced as a temporary measure to assist management across the public service in dealing with the large number of retirements of staff in the run up to the end of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; i.e. the period during which the calculation of pension was unaffected by the pay reductions applied under the <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009.</i>  In order to protect public services it was critical that management in each of the sectors had knowledge of the numbers of staff retiring and the business areas that might be affected by potentially large scale departures.  While the specific circumstances of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; resulted in a higher number of retirements than would normally occur, it remains critical that management know when key staff will be leaving their organisation. </P>
        <P>In addition, we are required under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF to make quarterly returns on the progress being made in relation to reductions in numbers in the public service.  Accurate and early information on forthcoming retirements is an important input and it provides us with information on whether the reduction in the public service pay bill arising from impending retirements is sufficient to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated that it is my intention to issue a revised instruction in relation to notice requirements for retirements and resignations in the civil service.  Discussions are taking place with the civil service unions and will be concluded as soon as possible.  The question of senior civil servants and key personnel giving longer notice is also being examined.</P>

	<P>A detailed framework is already in place relating to the standards of professional conduct and behaviour applying to public officials in addition to those in place to ensure the probity of financial transactions.  This framework is established under ethics legislation and covers under various statutory Codes of Conduct key aspects of the performance of the official duties of, for example, civil service and local government employees in relation to standards of performance, behaviour at work and standards of integrity in order to ensure that the highest standards of probity are maintained.  In key sectors of the wider public service such as the Health Service Executive and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Codes of Conduct have been put in place under sectoral legislation. </P>
        <P>As far as other non-commercial State bodies are concerned, under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies which State bodies are required to adopt, Codes of Business Conduct must be put in place for employees relating to such objectives as:</P>

Candidates with postgraduate economic qualifications were targeted through an Administrative Officer (Economist) competition run by the Public Appointments Service earlier this year.  Some 27 staff recruited initially under the competition are due to take up placements in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance over the coming weeks, as well as in a number of other Departments.  These recruits will supplement the existing economic and evaluation expertise already within the public service, including the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit within my Department.  After a period of training and development, some of these recruits will be seconded to other Departments with identified economic analysis needs.</P>

	<P>I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>   website;</P>

        <P><Miles com="bull66" />sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Circular 10/10 has been in place for almost two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small and Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</P>

	<P>Since coming into office, the current Government has been working on a range of measures to boost employment and help stimulate economic growth beginning with the Jobs Initiative, launched in May 2011, which comprised a range of taxation and expenditure measures of &euro;1.8bn designed to help get people back to work. </P>
        <P>Last year, my Department undertook a review of the public capital programme, the results of which were published in the &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;. The Framework sets out &euro;17 billion worth of Exchequer investment intended to address critical infrastructure investment gaps in order to aid economic recovery, social cohesion and environmental sustainability. While the significant level of investment allocated under the Framework is in line with European norms, will generate activity throughout the country and will provide adequate resources for the next five years it is not the true summit of our ambitions. I am very conscious that there is much more that we could do if we had additional funding available.</P>
        <P>In this context, my Department has been working closely with the Department of Finance and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) to identify potential new sources of funding for infrastructure projects where it makes sense and offers value for money for the State. It should be noted however, that while infrastructure investment will play an important role in any stimulus package put forward by the Government, it is not the only way in which economic activity will be stimulated. My cabinet colleagues are also exploiting opportunities to create jobs and encourage economic growth.

	<P>The House will be aware from my previous statements that a number of inter-departmental steering groups have been established to examine each of the assets referred to in the programme of State asset disposals that I announced in February. These groups are charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with identifying any implications for employment that will arise from the sales in question. Notwithstanding this, I do not necessarily accept the suggestion in the Deputy&rsquo;s question that job losses are a likely outcome of this process. Apart from the receipts from the sale of assets that the Government will retain for reinvestment, the sale of certain business units of State companies may actually offer the prospect of access to significant new capital to grow these businesses, which might not have otherwise have been available, given the current position in capital markets. The Bord G&aacute;is Energy sale and the proposed divestment of some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation assets also presents an opportunity to achieve wider economic benefits by introducing new players into the Irish market thereby leading to increased competition, which should, hopefully,  increase efficiency, drive down costs and lead to reduced prices to consumers and businesses. </P>
        <P>With regard to the investment of receipts from any sales, I have, after long-term negotiations, reached agreement with Troika representatives that all of the proceeds will be used, in one shape or another, to support job creating initiatives in the economy. Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature. The other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to guarantee additional lending into Ireland, for example by the EIB, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.</P>

	<P>There is no commitment in the Programme for Government to bring forward legislation to prevent the rehiring of retired public servants who have taken a gratuity and who have pensions. </P>
        <P>The general policy is that staff should not be retained beyond retirement age and any re-engagement should be kept as limited as possible and should be for a very restricted period.   Usually, the rehiring of retirees is related to completion of a specific task where their particular skill or experience is required in the short-term.  Situations can arise where a particular issue requires a short-term specialist input in order to complete a task. In many instances the most appropriate and cost-effective way of solving a short-term problem is to bring in someone who has worked in the area and understands the background.  In the vast majority of cases these re-hires are very short-term and project specific and it would not justify the expense of any more formal selection process. There are no plans to introduce such legislation as we need to retain a degree of flexibility in order to deal with situations as they arise. There are already protections in place vis a vis the requirement to have an excluding order and also the fact that abatement of salary applies in such cases.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made clear on a number of occasions the absolute horror and revulsion which all right-thinking people feel at the recent course of events in Syria and the escalating conflict which is now estimated by the UN to have claimed well over 10,000 lives in the past fifteen months. On behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, I have condemned the appalling massacre at Houla on 25-26 May which resulted in the brutal murder of more than one hundred people, including 49 children, and equally condemn the mass killing of a reported 78 people in the village of Al-Qubeir on 6 June allegedly committed by Assad-affiliated militias. These atrocities provide further unwelcome testimony of the Syrian regime&rsquo;s utter disdain for human life and the welfare of its own people.  High Representative Ashton, on behalf of the EU, has forcefully condemned the recent violence in Syria in a statement on 3 June and has called for those responsible for the Houla massacre to be held accountable. A number of our EU partners also took the step following the Houla massacre of expelling their resident Syrian Ambassadors or Charge d&rsquo;Affaires. However, as I explained in my statement of 30 May, such a step did not arise for Ireland as Syria does not have a resident Mission in Ireland but rather accredits from London where there has been no Ambassador since last March.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, was also active in securing adoption by the UN Human Rights Council on the 1 June of a strong resolution, co-sponsored by all EU countries, which extends the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry in Syria established last August to investigate the events at Houla and report to the UN Security Council on any responsibility that may warrant future criminal prosecutions. Those responsible for committing such atrocities as those witnessed in Houla and Al-Qubair must know that they will be held to account and will not evade prosecution.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to remain optimistic in face of the rapidly deteriorating situation on the ground and undoubtedly the conflict in Syria is now at a critical juncture as to whether an all-out descent into a bitter, sectarian civil war can be avoided. Ultimately, as Joint UN/Arab League Special Envoy, Kofi Annan, has emphasised when addressing the UN Security Council last week, it is for all those who have undertaken to implement his six-point peace plan to honour their commitments as well as their obligations under international law. In particular, the Assad regime must ensure the complete withdrawal of heavy weaponry and troops from population centres, the release of all political detainees, and ensure free access and movement throughout the country to all, including media, humanitarian organisations and the UN. Any obstruction or attempt to prevent observers of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS, and to which Ireland is contributing six officers) from fulfilling their mandate, as happened with the shootings directed at some observers as they approached the village of Al Qubeir on 7 June, is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Despite the obstacles it faces, the Annan Plan remains the only agreed plan at present for ending the violence and promoting a peaceful transition in Syria. If the Syrian regime or any other party continues to fail to meet their obligations under the Plan, then they will leave the Security Council with little option but to re-visit the issue and actively consider the imposition of sanctions against those impeding the implementation of a peace plan endorsed by the international community. Closer engagement with Russia also remains extremely important, given that they remain the one country best placed to exert influence on the Syrian authorities at the current time. I am not in any way persuaded by those who call for military interventions or arming the opposition and believe such steps would only hasten a descent into all-out civil war. Pressure also needs to continue to be exerted on all Syrian opposition groups, both internal and external, to work more closely together and to agree a common platform since without such opposition unity and cooperation, progress in initiating any kind of internal political dialogue on Syria&rsquo;s future will remain very difficult.</P>
        <P>The humanitarian situation in Syria continues to remain critical, with an estimated 80,000 Syrians having been forced to flee to neighbouring countries and upwards of one million civilians inside Syria urgently in need of sanitation, food and medical aid. Ireland is continuing to work closely with the UN and other international partners to address this situation. The recent agreement between the Syrian authorities and the UN on the opening of four UN humanitarian field offices is at least one positive development of note. Irish Aid has already made available emergency funding of &euro;500,000 to the ICRC, UNHCR and WFP for use both within Syria and to assist those fleeing the violence.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the complete cessation of violence and implementation of the Annan Plan in full offer the best opportunity for ending the conflict and setting in train a process of urgently needed political reform and transition in Syria.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work in support of this aim.</P>

        <Quest> if the Irish Government will support the proposal of the European Commission to upgrade the trade relationship between the European Union and Israel through the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products at a time when the European Union has again expressed concerns regarding the ongoing illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is a normal technical measure under the existing EU-Israel Association Agreement and Action Plan, and does not represent any upgrading or major change in EU-Israel trade relations. It is one of eight such agreements concluded so far with the EU&rsquo;s Mediterranean partners, including also Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority. These agreements are intended to eliminate technical barriers to trade, and so facilitate trade in both directions. They provide for mutual recognition of standards based on the adoption of the EU system and legislative norms by the countries concerned. This in turn further enhances the acceptance and reach of EU standards.  The agreements concern various areas of manufactured goods. It has been expected that the agreement with Israel might relate especially to pharmaceuticals, and perhaps increase the availability in the EU of generic medicines, at lower cost to patients and health services.</P>
        <P>The ACAA with Israel was signed in 2010 and is currently awaiting approval by the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has been especially active in bringing attention to bear at EU level on the issues surrounding Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. But no Irish Government has supported blocking normal trade relations with Israel on that basis, nor would there be any possibility of success if we were to attempt to do so. This policy, and the reasons for it, have been stated many times in the Oireachtas.</P>

        <P>In all cases the number of organisations and the amount of support is kept under review and opportunities for savings are actively explored.

        <P>Funding is provided to partner organisations following a rigorous appraisal process by Irish Aid. All funding applications must meet strict and transparent criteria, have clearly identified specific objectives and have demonstrable results that will have a sustainable and positive impact on improving the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest communities.</P>
        <P>Based on the trend over the past three years, on average, Irish Aid funds in excess of four hundred organisations annually.

A detailed analysis of spending under the aid programme is provided each year in the Irish Aid Annual Report.</P>
        <P>In addition to the individual reviews that form a normal part of my Department&rsquo;s approach to funding, an overall review of funding was carried out last year as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, which resulted in some savings being achieved.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a Notice of Assessment to income tax issued to the person in question for 2011 following the receipt of his Return of Income together with a health expenses claim for that year.  An underpayment of tax arose as the person and his wife are both in receipt of taxable payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and according to Revenue records only one DSP payment was taken into account in the tax credit certificate that issued to the person for the year 2011. The health expenses claim absorbed some of the undercharge, leaving a net amount outstanding of &euro;713.96. The person should contact the Office of the Collector General to make arrangements to pay the amount due.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also arranged for the issue of an amended tax credit certificate &mdash; Week 1 basis &mdash; for the year 2012 taking account of the correct DSP pension figures.  The Inspector of Taxes, North City Revenue District has written to the person outlining the position for the years 2011 and 2012.</P>

	<P>I am advised by NAMA that there is no single standard set of terms for stapled debt which NAMA may offer to parties acquiring commercial property from NAMA borrowers or receivers. Terms quoted will vary to reflect the attributes of various commercial property categories and individual properties, the varying strengths of tenants and leases, and the strength of counterparties/property purchasers.  NAMA advises that only strong and reputable counterparties will be considered for stapled finance.  For instance, NAMA advises that for prime investment properties, that is properties whose investment characteristics include, for instance, good location and strong tenants on leases with long maturity at realistic rents, which would qualify for the most generous loan terms, NAMA may offer up to 70% of the purchase price for a period of 5 years at a typical interest margin of 3% over cost of funds.</P>

	<P>I am advised by NAMA that it does not and has not provided financing other than staple financing for the purchase of commercial property under the control of its debtors and receivers.  Similarly, NAMA has advised that in the case of purchases of residential property controlled by its debtors and receivers the Agency does not and has not provided financing.</P>
        <P>The Agency has recently introduced its 80:20 Deferred Payment Initiative, which has been launched on a pilot basis in respect of 115 houses in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath. Financing under the Deferred Payment Initiative is currently available from one of Bank of Ireland, AIB through its mortgage subsidiary EBS, and Permanent TSB with normal lending terms applying.  It should be noted that this is not mortgage financing by NAMA as the source of the financing on that Initiative rests with the banks.  NAMA is, in certain circumstances, willing to fund the purchase of commercial property under the control of its debtors and receivers through staple financing.  Applied to the right product and right purchaser, staple financing provides, I am advised by NAMA, an opportunity to bring more buyers, including international buyers, into the Irish commercial property market.</P>
        <P>I am advised by NAMA that it would not rule out in individual circumstances arrangements that include an element of deferred payment in respect of residential property transactions controlled by its debtors and receivers.  NAMA have advised that they will look at other requests for financing on a case by case basis.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions, in line with Government policy to reduce public service numbers. However, I recognise the need to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue while meeting the existing Employment Control Framework allocations. I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to consider reducing Revenue&rsquo;s target staff numbers over a longer period of time, whilst at the same time allowing Revenue some scope to replace critical skills and experience. This request is under consideration. In the meantime, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the replacement of some critical posts in Revenue and the Deputy may have seen some recruitment advertising by Revenue in the media recently.</P>

	<P>I attended the Bilderberg meeting in Westfield Marriot, Chantilly, Virginia, USA, from 1 to 3 June 2012.  I, like a number of my European colleagues (both Ministers and EU Commissioners), was invited to attend given my position as Minister for Finance.  I travelled alone and the total cost associated with my travel and accommodation came to &euro;4,358.33.  For further information, I would point Deputies to the Bilderberg Meetings website (<i>www.bilderbergmeetings.org</i>), which includes information on the organisation&rsquo;s governance, steering committee, meetings and associated press releases.</P>
        <P>At this meeting and its workshops I took the opportunity to set out to my fellow attendees the opportunities that exist in Ireland for investors and multinational companies.  I also outlined the significant progress Ireland is making in restoring stability and growth to the economy.  The Government is focused on encouraging as much investment as possible into Ireland and over recent months we have seen the strong level of inward investment in our economy and have seen the announcement of over 1,000 jobs per month from Foreign Direct Investment so far this year.  I would point out to Deputies that a number of the business attendees represent companies which have very significant investments in Ireland that support thousands of Irish jobs.</P>

	<P>Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created for the first time in Irish law a harmonised statutory system for the regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland of persons performing controlled functions or pre-approval controlled functions in regulated financial service providers.  Section 21 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 provides that a regulated financial service provider shall not permit a person to perform a controlled function unless the regulated financial service provider is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person complies with and abides by the fitness and probity standards.</P>
        <P>The fitness and probity regime is currently being introduced on a phased basis by the Central Bank, following two extensive consultation processes with the industry.  Under the 2010 Act, the fitness and probity regime, including the issue raised by the Deputy, is given effect via regulations and a statutory code made by the Central Bank.  The scope of the fitness and probity regime is set out in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 Regulations 2011, while the standards to be applied are set out in a Code issued by the Central Bank under section 50 of the Central Bank Act 2010.</P>

	<P>I am informed by NAMA that its 2011 annual report and financial statements, which is due for publication in July, will disclose the carrying value and fair value of its loans.  NAMA advises that it is not required to follow the Central Bank guidelines. However, in preparing its annual accounts, NAMA uses international financial reporting standards (IFRS) which are consistent with the Central Bank guidelines and require NAMA to disclose the carrying value and fair value of its loans. In accordance with these reporting standards, NAMA disclosed the carrying value and fair value of its loans in its 2010 annual report and financial statements, see Note 20(a) to the financial statements, page 100, and will make a similar disclosure in its 2011 annual report and financial statements.</P>
        <P>NAMA does not include these disclosures together with other additional disclosures required by IFRS in its quarterly unaudited management accounts, due to the time and expense which would be involved in preparing and presenting this additional information on a quarterly basis.</P>

        <P>I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it is bound by strict confidentiality requirements under Section 33AK(1)(b)(i) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended regarding disclosure of supervisory information relating to firms.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has developed a framework for reviewing, assessing and mitigating risks which have emerged in various industry sectors and across individual firms.  The overall themes or findings which emerge are published on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website, however, specific issues relating to individual firms are not published.</P>
        <P>Dormant Account inspections, responsibility for which has been delegated to the Central Bank by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs under Section 22 of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, do not fall under the category of themed reviews and inspections.</P>
        <P>Where the Bank conducts themed inspections on matters relating to conduct of business rules, the overall/general findings are published, however, again specific issues relating to individual firms are not published.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that the Central Bank entered into a settlement agreement with Merrion Stockbrokers Limited on 21 March 2012.  The settlement related to breaches of Regulations 112 and 33(1)(a) of the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 (&ldquo;the MiFID Regulations&rdquo;). Following the settlement, the Central Bank published a press release on 22 March 2012, which was agreed with Merrion Stockbrokers Limited as part of the settlement discussions. The Irish Times article of 23 March, to which the Deputy refers, would appear to be based on the information from the Central Bank press release.</P>

The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another. In considering applications for teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils&rsquo; needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.</P>
        <P>Where schools seek to have their resource allocation reviewed or make a new application, they should contact the NCSE in this regard.</P>
        <P>Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</P>
        <P>It is open to schools to contact their local SENO in this regard, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

        <Quest> if he will indicate definitively that a school (details supplied) in County Westmeath has been classified by his Department as a permanent recognised school; if so, if he will indicate the importance of that status being vested upon the school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that permanent recognition has been awarded to the school to which he refers. A letter confirming this has issued to the Patron and school authority.</P>
        <P>Schools granted permanent recognition status are eligible to apply to my Department for capital funding. It should be understood, however, that the provision of interim accommodation remains the responsibility of the Patron until my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet future demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five year programme announced on 12 March last is focused on meeting those demographic needs.</P>
        <P>In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet this demographic demand, it is not possible to indicate at this point when permanent accommodation can be provided for the school in question.</P>

	<P>The major building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. The Design Team are currently working on the Stage 2a Submission (Developed Sketch Design) and, when complete, the school will forward this submission to my Department for review.</P>
        <P>To ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the next 5 years, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most future demographic growth will be concentrated.</P>
        <P>The project for the school referred to by the Deputy will continue to progress through the design stages of architectural planning within the context of available funding. However, due to competing demands on my Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project to tender and construction stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Firstly, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </P>
        <P>My Department provides for the education of children with special educational needs, including pupils with Multiple Disabilities and pupils with Visual Impairment, through a number of support mechanisms depending on the child&rsquo;s assessed disability. In general, educational provision for children with special needs is made; in special schools; in special classes attached to ordinary schools; or in integrated settings in mainstream classes.</P>
        <P>The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally-assessed needs of each individual child. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many students with special educational needs will therefore not require or seek a special class placement, but will be educated along with their peers in mainstream provision, with additional supports.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas, as required, and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.</P>
        <P>I have therefore arranged for the Deputy&rsquo;s question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has access to detailed data on increments only in the Civil Service sector, for which I have direct responsibility. I will arrange for the relevant data in relation to the Civil Service to be collated and forwarded to the Deputy, as soon as it comes to hand.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to detailed data on increments is that it is not currently available or readily accessible within the sectors. Detailed pay roll data for other public servants, including that for increments is held and managed by individual public service employers. The availability of specific data on increments varies across those bodies. For example, detailed data on the cost of increments in the Local Authority sector is not currently available to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as it covers 34 individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>No specific financial provision is made to public service bodies in respect of increments as they are required to meet the cost within their overall pay allocations. Accordingly, as it is a matter for each public service body to manage the cost of increments on an individual basis within their individual pay allocations, details are not sought for expenditure planning purposes and the information does not form part of the estimates process. However, the public service reform plan provides for a move to shared services across the public service and this will ensure greater accuracy of data and provide access to improved management information in real time. This is one of the many strategic benefits of shared services.</P>
        <P>On increments generally, based on more detailed information recently requested by my Department on the total cost of increments in a full year in the various sectors, the estimated full year cost of increments in the public service (excluding the Local Authority sector) is now estimated at no more than &euro;180 million per annum and less than half that sum in 2012. Significantly reduced recruitment, the ongoing substantial fall in numbers of public servants and higher numbers reaching the maxima of scales has reduced the cost of increments.  This cost will continue to fall over the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to far reaching reform of the Public Service and providing better value for money, flexibility and service delivery in the Public Service.  The Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published last November, outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform.  These reforms reflect five major commitments to change, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />placing customer service at the core of everything we do;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />maximising new and innovative service delivery channels;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />radically reducing costs to drive better value for money;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />leading, organising and working in new ways; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />a strong focus on implementation and delivery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the Reform Plan across the Public Service.  For example, we are expanding e-government thought the recently published eGovernment Strategy.  We are rolling out the Public Service Card and increasing efficiency in public procurement.  Detailed proposals in other areas such as property management and external service delivery are at an advanced stage.  Progress also continues to be made in the area of shared services, which was identified as a major element of the reform programme, and I have recently announced plans for the establishment of a Human Resources Shared Service Centre (HRSSC) for the Civil Service in this regard.</P>
<P>As the Deputy is award a key element of the reform agenda is the reduction of the size of the Public Service, and by 2015 we expect to achieve a planned reduction of 37,500 staff, or 12%, since 2008.  While the reduction in Public Service numbers will reduce costs significantly, it will also necessitate major reform in all sectors.  In this context, the effective implementation of the redeployment arrangements under the Croke Park Agreement will be crucial to the success of the reform initiative.  This will allow increasingly limited staff resources to be directed to the areas of most strategic importance.  At the same time, the envisaged re-engineering of structures, systems and services will mean that the Public Service will be able to continue to deliver key services with reduced numbers.  Transition Teams drawn from existing Workforce Planning Groups were put in place in the Health, Education, Local Government, Justice and Defence, and Civil Service sectors to address the specific short-term challenges arising from retirements in the Public Service and to manage the process in their respective sectors.  The Strategic Workforce Planning Groups in each sector will continue to ensure that sectoral employers develop plans to deal on an ongoing basis with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the outflow of staff in 2012 and future years.  Guidelines for a Workforce Planning Framework for Departments and their agencies have been circulated by my Department and Workforce Plans are due to be finalised by Departments by end June.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the Reform Plan is being overseen by the Reform and Delivery Office established within my Department.  The Office is working closely with organisations across the Public Service to enable them to deliver meaningful reform at a local level, as well as leading on certain cross-cutting initiatives from the Reform Plan.</P>
        <P>In addition, Government Departments and major Offices have produced Integrated Reform Delivery Plans, which place centrally driven initiatives in the context of organisational and sectoral reforms.  Progress made on these Plans is also being overseen by the Reform and Delivery Office, which is also driving an increased capacity and capability for change, both centrally and across the various sectors of the Public Service, to ensure that the focus is firmly on implementation and delivery.</P>

Funding in relation to Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland is currently being reviewed.</P>
        <P>As regards the payment to the Independent Workers Union, this is paid in accordance with the objectives of the Trade Union Act 1975, which is designed to facilitate amalgamations and transfers of undertakings among trade unions by simplifying merger procedures.  In this context, grants are available from the Exchequer to meet the costs incurred by unions in this process.</P>
        <P>In relation to the payments to Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), an annual grant is paid to assist ICTU in meeting the cost of providing its Education, Training and Advisory Service (ETAS).  The grant-in-aid assists Congress in the area of policy development, the provision of education and training supports to union officials and members, and advice to affiliated unions on particular issues.  Between 2008 and 2011, there had been a phased reduction in the level of the Grant provided to ICTU for ETAS.</P>
        <P>The Department has decided to switch the focus of the allocation to ICTU towards a performance-based recurrent funding system for ETAS, whereby ICTU&rsquo;s educational and advisory services would receive continued funding if they meet specified agreed reporting requirements.</P>
        <P>The National Irish Safety Organisation is a voluntary not-for-profit body dedicated to the promotion of, and training in, occupational health and safety in Irish workplaces.  The development of the course was supported by the Health and Safety Authority. This was a once off payment and therefore there is no need for a review of this funding.</P>
        <P>Details of the financial allocations provided to the Offices and Agencies of my Department are provided in the list of Voted expenditure for the Department as set out in the Revised Estimates Volume.</P>

        <P>ITI&rsquo;s Board is made up of 6 representatives each from Ireland and Northern Ireland nominated by the relevant Minister and appointed by the North South Ministerial Council. Annual fees are paid to Board members.  The fees are at levels set by the North South Ministerial Council.  Board member fees are disclosed in the InterTradeIreland Annual Reports.

        <P>The Authority does not have a typical board. Pursuant to the Competition Act, 2002, an executive board of Members of the Competition Authority are employed as salaried Members and are required by statute to have sufficient expertise in, or experience of, one or more of the following areas, namely law, economics, public administration, consumer affairs or business generally.</P>
        <P><i>Competencies</i></P>
        <P>In relation to competencies, boards require a range of people with a variety of skills and competencies.  In general board members are required to have excellent interpersonal skills; to be able to think strategically and creatively; be impartial and consider issues objectively, be financially literate; and be committed to the highest standards of integrity and governance.</P>
        <P>In addition boards require a mix of people with expertise in particular areas e.g audit and financial issues, legal and regulatory matters.  The Boards of particular agencies will have further requirements specific to that agency, e.g. in the case of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, it is desirable that the board includes a member experienced in personal injury law.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Government policy is to introduce greater transparency in the appointment process.  In line with this policy and in an effort to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards, my Department advertises vacancies on the boards of the agencies under its remit.  In making board appointments my overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments.  I have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.</P>

	<P>Provision for the voluntary registration of stillbirths is contained in section 28 of the Civil Registration Act 2004. The definition of a &ldquo;stillborn child&rdquo; is contained in section 2(1) of that Act and provides that a stillborn child means a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life.</P>
        <P>Registration of stillbirths was first provided for in the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994. The definition of a stillbirth contained in that Act was carried forward to the 2004 Act. When the 1994 Act was passed by the Oireachtas, detailed consideration was given as to what the most appropriate definition of a stillbirth should be. The position varies from country to country. Some countries use gestational age only, while others use weight, or a combination of both. The preferred criterion of the World Health Organisation is weight, as it is more objectively determined than gestational age. At the time, it was considered that the definition of a stillbirth should be as wide as possible, consistent with accepted medical norms, and it is on this basis that the criteria described above were decided upon.</P>
        <P>As the definition of a stillbirth contained in the 2004 Act is consistent with accepted medical norms, I do not consider that an amendment to the criteria is warranted.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the current average times taken to process disability allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 30.8 weeks and 40.8 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  For invalidity pension appeals the relevant times are 35.3 weeks and 57.7 weeks while the relevant times for domiciliary care allowance are 28.5 weeks and 41.8 weeks.</P>
        <P>These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</P>

	<P>The annual Respite Care Grant of &euro;1,700 is paid to carers providing full-time care and attention to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  Approximately 77,000 carers benefitted from the grant in 2011.  The grant helps carers to get some respite for themselves or for the person for whom they are caring.  The grant is paid automatically to carers in receipt of care-related schemes administered by the Department, such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and domiciliary care allowance.  Other full time carers who are not in receipt of one of these schemes may apply to respite care grant section separately for the grant which is not means tested.  Respite care grant section administered nearly 6,000 of the above grants in 2011.</P>
        <P>A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  However, it will only be fully deployed for carers until mid-June.  Once fully deploy automation of respite care grant for carers customers will be possible.</P>

	<P>Department of Social Protection officials have received the results of the Citywide survey and note the issues raised therein.  The CE Drug Rehabilitation Projects are working with DSP staff to ensure the viability and continuation of the valuable work undertaken by such schemes.  In the six month period January-June of this year, DSP records show that there has been a reduction of 2% in participation on drug rehabilitation places nationally.  Our records also indicate that there has been a small reduction in the participation of people with a disability and no decrease in participation by lone parents.  Further research will be required by the Department of Social Protection to confirm the reasons for this.</P>
        <P>In terms of activation and progression it is highly desirable that people with disabilities and lone parents participate fully in labour market programmes particularly rehabilitative programmes.  Improvement to the promotion of these CE places to the target groups is very important.  I am advised that DSP has asked for these vacancies to be advertised on the National Call Centre, to facilitate their circulation across local Employment Offices and with the Local Employment Services.  DSP staff are in close contact with Drug Rehabilitation Schemes and will continue to monitor the situation</P>

	<P>The financial review of community employment schemes is very near to completion.  This review of CE schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.  </P>
        <P>Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes has taken longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This has allowed more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of community employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes.</P>
        <P>The outcomes of this review will be communicated to CE sponsoring organisations directly by staff in my Department in the coming weeks.  My Department is committed to supporting the community employment programme and the valuable contribution the programme makes to the provision of services to individuals and communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a financial review of community employment shemes been underway for the past few months.  It has involved staff engaging with individual schemes in relation to their specific financial standing and on-going requirements, collation of schemes submissions and also detailed analysis of the returns on a national basis.  Due to the volume and diversity of submissions, the review has taken longer than expected to complete.</P>
        <P>The review is now nearing completion and once the outcomes are finalised and the overall provision agreed by Government, details will be communicated directly to CE sponsoring organisations, including the two referred to be the Department, by staff in the Department.  This should be possible to do this month.</P>
        <P>Due to the current economic circumstances, the Government has had to find significant savings in the budget for 2012.  However, it is important to note that there has been no reduction in the number of participants or supervisors on CE.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to supporting CE participants and sponsoring organisations in continuing the valuable contribution the programme makes to individuals and communities across the country.</P>

        <Quest> the number of associations, organisations and regulatory bodies in receipt of grants, benefit in kind and sums of money from the State in tabular form for the past three years; if he is satisfied that the State should be financing such organisations; if he will undertake to examine the savings that can be made in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Details of grants paid by the Department of Social Protection to regulatory bodies and other organisations providing services on its behalf in the past three years are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>The three statutory bodies operating under the aegis of the Department are the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board (CIB) and the Pensions Board.  In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department.</P>
        <P>The grant payments relate mainly to the CIB and the Pensions Board.  In 2009, the Department made grant payments to the Family Support Agency as well as individual Money Advice and Budgeting Service companies which were subsumed into the CIB in 2010.  The Combat Poverty Agency was incorporated into the Office of Social Inclusion in the Department in July 2009 and transferred to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs in March 2010.  The Family Support Agency is now under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the Office of Social Inclusion transferred back to this Department in May 2011.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the State should continue to finance the organisations that currently receive funding from the Department.  I am also satisfied that appropriate steps have been taken to secure savings in the areas of responsibility of the organisations in question.</P>

	<P>There are currently 260 temporary clerical officers employed in the Department of Social Protection.  Temporary clerical staff are recruited by the Department to cover absences of permanent staff on maternity leave, long term sick leave, other statutory leave and also to provide cover for some staff availing of the shorter working year scheme.  They are also recruited to alleviate work pressure in certain areas.</P>
        <P>Temporary contracts are offered for a fixed purpose and the term can vary according to the purpose of the contract.  The contracts are kept under review by the HR Division and are terminated when the purpose for the contract has ceased.</P>
        <P>Some of the costs involved in the recruitment of temporary staff can be offset, for example, where permanent staff on certain statutory leave and those availing of the shorter working year scheme are on unpaid leave or where staff on long-term sick leave are on a reduced salary.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Advisor has been retained on a temporary contract beyond retirement.  His salary is abated to take account of his pension rate of payment.</P>
        <P>The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Advisor was taken due to his specific skills and experience, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that both my Department and the bodies under its aegis are subject to the moratorium on public sector recruitment and have been directed to achieve a progressive reduction in payroll costs staffing numbers through the implementation of an Employment Control Framework (ECF) over the period 2010-2015.  Progress in this regard is subject to regular review in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to agency and contract staffing of my Department and the bodies under its aegis are set out in the table below:</P>

	<P>The current membership of the boards of statutory agencies and national cultural institutions funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote and the annual fees payable to board members is set out in the following table.  There are no commercial semi-State companies under the aegis of my Department. It may be noted that fees are not payable to board members that are also public servants and, in addition, that in certain other cases members have chosen to waive their fees.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that not all members have been appointed by way of Ministerial appointment: some, for example, have been appointed by way of co-option arrangements, or have been elected, as in the case of the majority of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta members. Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency are North-South Implementation Bodies and board members in these instances are appointed by the North South Ministerial Council.</P>
        <P>Competencies of board appointees vary according to the body/institution involved and would reflect the particular requirements arising. If the Deputy requires more detailed information in this regard, she might wish to raise the matter with the individual body/institution in question.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his position with regard to assessment of prospective loss, damage or injury arising from earthquake or tsunami on the Corrib gas pipeline, however unlikely such occurrences may be;; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[28568/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by independent expert consultants engaged by my Department to monitor compliance with the conditions of the Corrib consents under the Gas and Petroleum Acts, that pipelines are normally designed taking account of the largest loads they are likely to experience during their life including, transport, loading, installation and operation.  Operational loads include those due to the pressure and flow of the fluid they contain and the externally imposed loads from the environment, both normal and accidental (such as earthquake loading).  Normal practice is to design the pipeline to withstand the largest of these loads taking account of the likelihood of extreme events.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that in the case of the Corrib pipeline the original design pressure (345 bar) and the forces imposed during laying of the offshore section will have determined the strength and therefore material and wall thickness of the pipe.  In the North Sea and North Atlantic regions these loads dominate over the environmental or accidental loadings and provide a margin of safety for any loadings due to earthquakes experienced in the region.  The risk of earthquakes of magnitude 5 or more is assessed by British Geological Survey as less than very low, the lowest risk assigned to any area. Earthquakes of magnitude less than 5 in these low risk areas will not give rise to forces on the pipeline greater than their design allows for.</P>
        <P>Shell E and P Ireland Ltd (SEPIL) has informed my Department that the Corrib wells and manifold were inspected by a subsea support vessel last week after the earthquake and it has confirmed that there has been no impact on the facilities.  A report will follow to confirm this, which will be reviewed by my Department in liaison with its independent consultants.  SEPIL has also advised that the observations of the pipeline system during the week confirm that there is no issue with the integrity of the pipeline.  The Corrib pipeline is due to be inspected this summer, and survey reports will follow.  These reports will also be considered by my Department and reviewed by the consultants.</P>
        <P>It should additionally be noted that the Corrib Gas Pipeline is currently at construction phase and that prior to the commissioning and coming into operation of the development, it will be the subject of a safety assessment in accordance with the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s recently published Petroleum Safety Framework.  The development cannot, therefore, be operated without a safety permit issued in accordance with the requirements of this new risk based regime which obliges undertakings to ensure</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) that any petroleum activity is carried on in such a manner as to reduce any risk to safety to a level that is as low as is reasonable practicable (ALARP) and</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) that any petroleum infrastructure is designed, constructed, installed, maintained, modified operated and decommissioned in such a manner as to reduce the risk to safety to a level that is ALARP.</P>

        <P>The House will also be aware from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that the decision on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors is statutorily a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and I have no function in the matter.  Most recently, the CER decision has been delayed by the requirement for the regulator to provide material to my Department in response to the further submission by Shannon LNG to DG Competition.  Detailed responses in relation to the issues raised about State aid compliance have recently been provided by my Department to DG Competition.  The CER has assured my Department that it remains committed to publishing a final decision at the soonest practicable date and is hopeful, subject to no further blockages emerging, that a decision will be made this month.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a copy of the Grant Thornton report when I met with the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union (IPU) recently.</P>
        <P>I welcome the IPU&rsquo;s ambition to identify opportunities for more business to be delivered through the Post Office network.</P>
        <P>An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.  The acknowledgment by the IPU that it is supportive of delivering new services is clearly positive in this regard.</P>
        <P>In the context of public sector transformation, I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the increased use of the post office network should be considered by public sector bodies where this is appropriate.</P>
        <P>As a commercial State body An Post may bid for business from both public and private organisations in a competitive market.  The nature and volume of business that An Post conducts with Government Departments and Public Sector Agencies is, however, in the first instance, a matter for the company and the respective Government Departments and Agencies.</P>
        <P>More generally, I would stress that I am committed to a strong and viable An Post and support the maintenance of the maximum number of economically viable post offices.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that no bonuses have been paid in respect of 2011 to CEOs in semi-State companies under the aegis of my Department.  All directions issued by the Government in relation to remuneration of CEOs in semi-State companies are brought to the attention of the relevant State companies.  The payment of performance bonuses to senior management below the level of Chief Executive is an operational matter for the companies.</P>

	<P>Details of funding for the past three years from my Department to agencies and regulatory bodies under its aegis are set out in the table that follows this reply.  In addition, subscriptions are also paid to a number of organisations operating in the sectoral areas for which my Department has responsibility.  The annual total of these subscriptions is also set out in the table.  A list of the organisations is provided.  I am satisfied that the State should be financing these agencies, regulatory bodies and organisations.  As part of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, my Department identified appropriate savings to be made in these areas over the coming years.</P>

        <P>The programme for climate policy and legislation which I published on 23 January 2012 set out my approach to the development of national policy and legislation over an 18 month period.  The principal milestones include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />a public consultation (which ran from 29 February to 1 April 2012);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />in the second half of this year, the publication of an initial report by the NESC Secretariat on potential climate polices and measures, and the development of heads of a Climate Bill for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht following Government approval; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />consideration of the final report by the NESC Secretariat and the heads of the Bill by the Committee in the first half of 2013.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I indicated in the programme for climate policy and legislation, I will publish the heads of a Climate Bill in the fourth quarter of 2012.</P>
        <P>In my presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on 15 December 2011, I set out my approach to ensuring that we develop the necessary policy mix to support an ambitious but realistic national direction towards a low-carbon future.  I advised the Committee that robust institutional arrangements will be essential to support the decisions we make on the way forward, but a clear understanding of how we propose to meet our commitments and pursue our objectives is essential to identify an appropriate support structure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>As previously indicated, the Central Bank, acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance, engaged PwC to carry out inspections of dormant accounts over a two year period. I did not authorise the PwC inspections under the Dormant Accounts legislation and the Central Bank was, in the circumstances, acting on its own authority. I therefore have no role in relation to these reports and the advice provided to my Department by the Central Bank is that it is not permitted to disclose confidential information concerning the banks that it supervises. I must respect the independence of the bank in such matters.</P>

The Regulations contain national eligibility criteria. These mandatory criteria must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support.

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  </P>
        <P>The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 imposes late payment fees and late payment interest where the owner of a residential property fails to pay the household charge in accordance with the Act.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. The LGMA has informed me that the household charge payment system does not accept household charge payments made after the 31 March deadline unless accompanied by the appropriate late payment fee and late payment interest.  I have asked the LGMA to make modifications to the payment system to allow for the retention of the &euro;100 household charge payment in such circumstances, with appropriate follow up in respect of the collection of late payment penalties where due.</P>

	<P>The Water Framework Directive requires the European Commission to review, every four years, the list of substances in the aquatic environment that require monitoring and control as potential pollutants.  The Commission published a proposal in January to include an additional 15 chemicals including 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 2 other pharmaceutical substances to the list of 33 existing priority substances.</P>
        <P>The proposal is limited to the identification of priority substances and to establishing environmental quality standards for them.  No concrete measures to be taken across the EU are prescribed in the proposal and the choice of measures to be taken at river-basin and water-body level would be left to Member States which can choose the most effective way of achieving the objectives taking into account local conditions.</P>
        <P>It is clear at this stage that several Member States do not support the inclusion of the pharmaceuticals on the list and discussions on the proposal are expected to continue for some time.</P>
        <P>There is little information on the presence and level of EE2 in the aquatic environment in Ireland.  It is a difficult substance to monitor and, to date, there has been no requirement to monitor it. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued a research call for proposals aimed at improving our knowledge of emerging priority substances, including EE2.  When the results of this research are available, we will have a clearer picture as to the environmental and public health impacts of these substances and the strategies that might be deployed to address them.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s broad policy approach in this area was set out in the Programme for Government. In line with this, I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future for an extensive programme of local government reform, with particular focus on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government. The reform programme will also reflect other work under way in relation to various aspects of local government, including local authority mergers, efficiency implementation, financing and alignment of local and community development with local government. Further aspects of the local government system on which proposals will be considered, including governance issues, will also be outlined. </P>
        <P>Work on the development of policy proposals for Government consideration in this area is informed, inter alia, by the extensive analysis, consultation, deliberation and debate that has already taken place in relation to local government reform. I have received submissions from, and held discussions with, the local government representative associations, with individual local authorities and with other interested groups and individuals. I also recently invited each individual councillor in the country to submit views to me on a number of issues relating to local government reform, including the concept of directly elected mayors/cathaoirligh.</P>
        <P>I envisage that, following decision by Government, a policy statement on local government will be published, which will provide a further opportunity for public comment and input ahead of the development of legislation to provide for reform measures. The content of local government reform legislation will be a matter for Government decision in the first instance and will, of course, be the subject of Oireachtas scrutiny and debate in the normal way.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981. </P>
        <P>My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority for the available capital funds.</P>
        <P>Correspondence has been received in my Department from Laois County Council in relation to proposals for works at Rathdowney fire station, and these are currently under consideration.

        <P FLI="0">Due to a sharp increase in demand for grant assistance under the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2011, the budget allocation of &euro;2.35m was expended by the end of November 2011; accordingly, grant applications received in December 2011 were held pending finalisation of the budget allocation for 2012.  A significant portion of the 2012 budget allocation (&euro;2.35m) was expended early in 2012 as a result. The registration of additional Community and Voluntary groups who wish to administer the Scheme is also increasing applications for funding in 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department has examined the operation of the scheme with the aim of ensuring its sustainability and an equitable distribution of funding country-wide. The following temporary changes were notified to groups on 26 March 2012, and took effect from 30 March 2012:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Funding will only be available for the purchase and installation of socially monitored alarms at a maximum of &euro;250 per alarm (Maximum funding of &euro;50 is also available for additional pendants and reinstallations).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Grants to Community and Voluntary groups will be capped at &euro;30,000 per annum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The aim of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to support independent living for those over 65 who live alone or who live with a person who is also over 65 years of age and of limited financial means. A key element of the Scheme is the provision of funding for a socially monitored alarm which supports this independence. Having regard to available funding in the current economic climate, the changes above will ensure that my Department can continue to maintain the Scheme in a viable way and provide the maximum number of socially monitored alarms to as many older persons as possible in 2012.</P>

	<P>The current landfill levy rate is &euro;50 per tonne for each tonne of waste disposed of at landfill facilities, with the exception of certain exempted categories of waste. This rate will increase to &euro;65 per tonne from 1 July 2012.  </P>
        <P>The landfill levy is designed to encourage a shift away from landfill to waste management practices which are higher in the internationally accepted waste hierarchy, and this increase is intended to send a strong price signal to the producers, collectors and managers of waste that the current reliance on landfill is unsustainable.  In April 2011, I announced this increase, and a further planned increase to the landfill levy to &euro;75 per tonne in July 2013, during the passage through the D&aacute;il of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This provided the waste sector with certainty regarding landfill levy rates and also with an opportunity to prepare for the changes that these increases would require.</P>
        <P>This Bill, which was subsequently enacted as the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, also provided that the levy could be increased once in any given financial year, subject to a maximum increase of &euro;50 per tonne, and also provided for an absolute limit on the levy of &euro;120 per tonne.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area. Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group.</P>
        <P>The proposed public utility model represents a major change with significant implications for local government, the water industry in Ireland and its many stakeholders. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, and these skills within the Bord G&aacute;is Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.  A phased transition is proposed to ensure continuity of service and the building of a fit for purpose organisation within a reasonable timescale.</P>
        <P>A high level plan for the phased transition of functions from local authorities to Irish Water was set out in the independent assessment,  involving:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the appointment of a Programme Management Office in 2012 to manage the transition process;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of Irish Water on an interim basis in 2012 and under its own statute in mid 2013 at which stage Irish Water would acquire statutory responsibility for water services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water for a period with Irish Water taking over their operations on a phased basis from January 2015; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the full transfer of operations being completed by end 2017 at the earliest.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Work is now focused on the finalisation of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail, and will recommend appropriate transitional arrangements. The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.  The development and rollout of the strategy will also involve co-operation with local authorities and staff to ensure that the change is managed well. The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.</P>
        <P>No final decision has been made regarding the name of the new public water utility.  The name &ldquo;Irish Water&rdquo; is currently the working title. A decision on the question of an Irish version of the name will be made in the near future. It is proposed that Irish Water, although a national company, will have a regional and local focus. Decisions on the location of the head office and regional offices will be a matter for Irish Water.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the overall water reforms the Government has planned will create 2,000 construction related jobs in the economy on an ongoing basis. This will be achieved through the planned roll-out of the programme of water metering which will lead to the creation of up to 2,000 jobs for the duration of the metering installation programme. A steady level of capital investment of potentially &euro;600 million per annum in water services, facilitated through the new public utility would see this level of construction employment sustained on an ongoing basis through capital investment in new infrastructure.</P>

        <P>In August 2011, Dublin City Council requested urgent funding from my Department to address health and safety concerns in respect of Tallaght Fire Station. On foot of this, the Department has approved in principle grant-aid of &euro;300,000 in respect of necessary works. The Department has requested detailed cost estimates and design drawings from Dublin City Council.

	<P>Housing authority rents are set in accordance with a rent scheme adopted by each local council. The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of housing authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for housing authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme. Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual housing authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</P>
        <P>Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, when commenced, will replace existing enactments in relation to differential rent schemes. Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities to give effect to section 31 are currently in preparation in my Department. When these are made section 31 will be commenced and authorities will have one year in which to put in place a differential rent scheme under the new provisions. While it is not the intention to introduce a national standardised differential rent scheme, the regulations to be made will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for rent purposes.</P>

        <P>No additional education bodies or qualifications have to date been prescribed for the purposes of Section 43(2) of the Building Control Act 2007 and no proposals of this nature are currently being considered by my Department.</P>

It was categorised as being a Category 3 estate by Kerry County Council, which means it is an estate where the developer is in place but there is no on-site activity and the developer is responsible for managing the site from a public safety perspective. </P>
        <P>Accordingly this development is ineligible for funding from my Department under the public safety initiative.</P>

These programmes are subject to ongoing and periodic review to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness in the achievement of policy objectives. In the management of these programmes, procedures are in place to ensure that guidelines on public procurement are complied with and that all payments are made in accordance with public financial procedures. The detailed information sought in relation to payments under the programmes is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.    </P>

	<P>All appointments to State Agencies are made in accordance with the appropriate legislation governing appointments to each body and vacancies are filled as the need arises.   </P>
        <P>The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012, which was recently passed by the Oireachtas, will facilitate my Department&rsquo;s agency rationalisation programme, under which 21 agencies will be reduced to 11.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are already merged, in an operational sense, with a common board, pending the establishment of the merged body &mdash; the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) &mdash; on a statutory basis. The LGMA will also take on the residual functions from An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which will be dissolved.</P>
        <P>The Affordable Homes Partnership will be dissolved and its functions, as well as those of the Centre for Housing Research and the National Building Agency, have been merged into the interim Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA). The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency is currently operating on an administrative basis and will be established on a statutory basis.  The Fire Services Council&rsquo;s term of office expired on 30 June, 2009 and no new appointments were made to the Council after that date. The Minister announced that the work of the Council would be absorbed into the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management   under the aegis of the Local Government Division of the Department.</P>
        <P>The Limerick Regeneration Agencies will be dissolved and their functions will be taken over by the new Office for Regeneration which has been established in Limerick City.  The Regeneration Office has initially been set up with administrative support from Limerick City Council but will report directly to the Manager Designate of the new Limerick Unitary Authority once appointed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows:</P>
        <P LI="3"> (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</P>
        <P LI="3"> (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</P>
        <P>Measures I introduced last year have resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases decided. Already this year I have made a decision in approximately 13,500 applications and in total this year I expect to have made a decision on some 24,000 applications. By contrast approximately 16,000 valid citizenship applications were determined in 2011 and just under 7,800 cases in 2010.</P>
        <P>I undertook to get to the stage by the second quarter of this year, that in the generality of cases i.e. around 70%, that persons applying for a certificate of naturalisation will be given a decision on their application within six months.  In this regard, a major effort has and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process applications. It is expected that the six month timeframe for the generality of new applications received from this month onwards will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended provides that the Minister may decide to grant or refuse an application in his absolute discretion. Where an application is refused, in general, the letter issued to an applicant informing him or her of my decision will provide reasons for that decision insofar as it is appropriate to do so and where the explanation given cannot be interpreted as a fettering of the absolute discretion given to the Minister in the Act. In relation of appeals, there is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended for appeal in relation to an application for a certificate of naturalisation. I would make the general comment that these issues have been tested before the Courts and have been found to be in accordance with the law.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the current Long Term Residence scheme under which spouses of persons who have been granted Long Term Residency on Stamp 4 conditions for 5 years, are entitled to permission to remain in the State on a Stamp 3 (Dependants Stamp) for 5 years, once they also have accrued the required 60 months reckonable residence in the State on Stamp 3 conditions and meet the criterion of good character. </P>
        <P>The existing practices and procedures for the granting of Long Term Residence are under currently review and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context and of course also in the context of the difficult labour market situation.  The Deputy might also wish to note that a Stamp 3 may also be issued to spouses of persons who hold a Stamp 4 other than through the Long Term Residence scheme. Spouses of Stamp 4 holders who wish to work in the State may be eligible for a spousal work permit on the basis that their wife/husband has held valid work permits. The issuing of work permits is a matter for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to this matter remains as indicated in my written Reply to Question number 313 of 8 May 2012. I have also addressed this matter in the course of my speech and open discussion of the modernisation and reform of the legal sector at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14th April &mdash; the full text of the speech remains available on my Department&rsquo;s web-site, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, for ease of reference. </P>
        <P>As I have conveyed on such previous occasions, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the Authority&rsquo;s Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council and their respective disciplinary tribunals to deal with complaints, as happens at the moment, but will instead do so through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
        <P>The Law Society has, earlier this year, recognised that it would be &ldquo;in the best interests of the public and the profession&rdquo; if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill. I have commended this development because it will underpin public perceptions of impartiality in the regime governing the conduct and discipline of the legal professions to the utmost degree. The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or by their representative bodies.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 the complaints systems currently operated by the legal professional bodies are to be replaced by new procedures the independence of which will have to be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes. In closing the Second Stage debate on the Bill and in my address to the Law Society of 14 April, I have confirmed that I am considering possible Committee Stage amendments to create  appropriately independent procedures for the appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Similarly, I expressed the view that staff appointments to the new Authority would be better made by the Authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service. While the transition to a new and independent complaints procedure under the Bill will have an impact on staff currently involved in that area it will be open to such staff  &mdash; who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience &mdash; to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</P>

	<P>In February 2010, the Bioenergy Scheme was launched as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) under the Rural Development Programme.  This Scheme is 50% co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  The level of grant-aid available under the Bioenergy Scheme since 2010 is 50% of the crop establishment costs up to a maximum of &euro;1,300 per hectare.  This reflects the reduction in crop establishment cost since the launch of the pilot Bioenergy Scheme 2007-2009.  From 2007 to end December 2011, just over 3,000 hectares of crops have been established under the Bioenergy Schemes. The Bioenergy Scheme for 2012 closed for applications on 27th January 2012.  Approvals have issued to establish some 340 further hectares of crops under the 2012 Bioenergy Scheme.</P>

MTL is also deemed to be a &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 by virtue of the fact that they have a public service pension scheme, and is, therefore, statutorily prohibited from increasing pay rates.<b></b> In this context, the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park) extend to employees of MTL. </P>
        <P>Having regard to the foregoing MTL has been advised that no pay increases will be approved in Departments, agencies or their subsidiaries in line with current public service pay policy and having regard to the explicit provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s decision in 2011, I invite expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies operating under the aegis of my Department. In making any board appointments, I am not necessarily confined to those who make such expressions of interest but will ensure that all of those appointed have the relevant mix of knowledge and expertise to contribute to the board.</P>
        <P>In the case of a number of the State Bodies, the board appointments, whilst made by me, are not made at my sole discretion and instead individuals are nominated by various organisations for appointment by me as specified in the relevant statutes. These are the Aquaculture Licensing Appeals Board, Teagasc, National Milk Agency, Veterinary Council of Ireland and Horse Racing Ireland.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of appointments to State Boards during my tenure and the details of these are outlined in the table below:</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Act 2010, consolidated previous adoption legislation and gave force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption.  The regulatory framework governing adoption has been strengthened in an attempt to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at every step throughout the adoption process.</P>
        <P>The area of information and tracing is extremely complex and requires specific legislation in its own right. Considerable progress has been made in drafting the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2012.  The proposed legislation has been included in the legislative programme for my Department for 2012 and it is one of a number of Bills which I intend to introduce in the Oireachtas during the course of this year.</P>
        <P>While the drafting of the Heads of Bill is still under way in my Department, I can say that it is currently intended that the Heads of Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have responsibility for the safeguarding and maintenance of all adoption records in the State. It is also intended that the Heads of Bill will provide that the Authority is to have responsibility for ensuring that access to those records is provided to an adopted person or to a birth parent, in accordance with the Bill.</P>
        <P>The draft Heads of Bill will be submitted to Government for approval prior to commencing the drafting of the Bill. It is not possible to give a publication date for the Bill at this stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of public bodies under the auspices of my Department is that there are four agencies funded by the Exchequer through my Department&rsquo;s Vote. These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Ombudsman for Children.     With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.   They are funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote and I am responsible for the appointment of their board of management. I do not have responsibility for any semi-State company. There is no Board of Management for the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
        <P>The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. For example, the Adoption Act 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &mdash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board.  There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. The Children Act 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.</P>
        <P>In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.</P>
        <P>I have set out in tabular format below, a list of current Board memberships, the remuneration received for each individual and their particular background or profession:</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s priority at all times has been that the three treating clinics involved in the PIP breast implant issue provide professional and appropriate care to their affected clients.  The Chief Medical Officer has met with and continues to engage with the clinics to ensure that best practice and patient support is paramount in the service provided to concerned recipients of these implants.  It has been impressed on the treating clinics that an appropriate care programme must be in place and that clinical care should be provided to each client as considered appropriate by their treating surgeon.  The provision of an improved care package by one of the treating clinics has been the subject of intense discussions between my officials and the provider concerned and the CMO continues to liaise with the provider in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s website and the website of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) continue to provide regular updates and information on the ongoing EU and international scientific investigation of PIP implants.  The advice of both my Department and the IMB has remained constant and readily available to all interested parties, i.e.:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer for women with this brand of implant;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the risk of rupture is within expected norms and routine explantation is not recommended;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />anyone with a concern about their breast implants should discuss the matter with their GP or surgeon.  In addition, the Chief Medical Officer appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on 3rd May last to fully brief and answer members&rsquo; questions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The resolution of the implants issue has to be between provider and client and an appropriate solution found between the parties; my Department will continue to encourage all parties to reach an acceptable solution for all concerned.</P>

        <P>Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  The Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that 95% of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>The next priority for the SDU is access to diagnostics.  This programme of work has commenced in terms of access to GI endoscopy and will later in 2012 examine access to radiology services.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

	<P>The HSE and Voluntary hospitals recoup a considerable amount of income from private insurance companies in return for private and semi-private treatment services provided to patients with private health insurance cover.  However, lengthy delays often occur between the discharge of patients and the receipt of payment from the health insurance companies.</P>
        <P>The HSE has introduced a number of initiatives to improve the claims collection process and facilitate faster submission of claims which will accelerate income collection within the public hospital system.  These initiatives include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The HSE has tasked hospitals with bringing down the value of claims awaiting Consultant action and hospitals will also target the highest-value claims.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The HSE has recently concluded the tender process for the roll-out of an electronic claims management system in eleven hospitals to replace the current paper based system.  This will be commenced on a phased basis this year, and scoping work has already commenced in five sites.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The implementation of measures to support timely and efficient collection of private patient income is one of the issues under discussion at present between health service management and the consultants&rsquo; representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which I established this year, also enables dialogue with insurers on the issue of cost and efficiency, including the issue of income collection.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>The next priority for the SDU is access to diagnostics. This programme of work has commenced in terms of GI endoscopy and will later in 2012 examine access to radiology services.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

        <P>Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  The Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.</P>
        <P>In response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the HSE procured two vaccines.  The HSE, with the approval of my Department and the Department of Finance, indemnified the suppliers from and against loss and damage in respect of any claim against the supplier arising from or in connection with the use and administration of licensed or unlicensed vaccine supplied.  The indemnity clause in relation to the supplier in question is attached.</P>
        <P>This was a necessary response in order to ensure that Ireland could access the vaccine as early as possible during the pandemic.  All European countries who accessed pandemic vaccines indemnified the companies who supplied them.  The report of the National Narcolepsy Steering Committee was published on 19 April and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Education and Skills to address the needs of those affected by narcolepsy.  The HSE has provided a range of services and supports to those affected including access to rapid diagnosis, clear care pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred.</P>
        <P>Multi-disciplinary assessments which will allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place have commenced. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is currently engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.  In addition, reasonable accommodations have been put in place for students with narcolepsy starting state exams today.  My Department is considering all other possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.  A Memorandum for Government setting out the full response to this issue is being prepared for submission in the coming weeks.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 226, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am determined to address the issues leading to unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of GP referrals by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. (NTPF).  As an initial priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that 95% of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in achieving a 9 month maximum waiting time for inpatient and daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>Very significant progress had been made on the SDU initiatives on unscheduled care in emergency departments (EDs): the number of patients waiting on trolleys was 27% lower than the previous year.  This equates to significant numbers of patients whose experience of our EDs was markedly improved.  Similarly, new targets for access to diagnostics and outpatient appointments, which the SDU is currently focusing on, will be key to the overall improvement of hospital services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The HSE receives annual funding, from within which it agrees to deliver the targets for scheduled and unscheduled care in the Annual Service Plan.  Cost containment plans are in place for hospitals and community services to bring their spending profiles in line with their allocations, as no additional funding is available for this year.  There are limited financial resources available to the SDU and the NTPF, to assist individual hospitals with specific measures to achieve these targets.  The Programme for Government has a commitment to reforming hospital funding and to introducing a more transparent and efficient &lsquo;money follows the patient&rsquo; system. Work is continuing on the development of this, as part of the Universal Health Insurance System. In addition, the HSE is using prospective funding arrangements for certain elective orthopaedic procedures at some hospitals. This funding mechanism is procedure-based and similar money follows the patient initiatives will be rolled out to other hospitals and procedures, on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>The impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years presents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  Employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 by the end of this year, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce public expenditure. Therefore, replacement will only occur in critical areas.  There has, however, been considerable redeployment in the health sector under the Public Service Agreement. This includes staff flexibility in continuing to deliver services during and after retirements. The Health Sector Action Plan for 2012, under the Public Service Agreement, includes provision for further use of redeployment in the health sector.</P>
        <P>I have forwarded the queries on Letterkenny General Hospital and on the national discharge and hospital resource figures to the HSE, which will respond directly to the Deputy in relation to those particular queries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
        <P>The Forum on Fluoridation advised in 2002 that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on the tolerable upper intake for fluoride from the diet. This concluded that the safe upper limit for fluoride intake from all food sources, including water, for adults is 120&igrave;g per kilogram of body weight per day.  A study by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), the Total Diet Study (TDS) published in 2011, shows that the average exposure of Irish consumers to fluoride from food is 9&igrave;g per kilogram of body weight per day. This represents 7.5% of the safe upper limit of 120&igrave;g per kilogram of body weight per day.  If exposure to fluoride from drinking water is included it represents 23.9% of this value on average. The FSAI aims to start the second Irish TDS later this year. This will also include an analysis of fluoride in food.</P>

	<P>The Deputy refers to the person whose details are supplied who requires to have her professional qualifications recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC.</P>
        <P>Directive 2005/36/EC, on the recognition of professional qualifications, applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in EEA countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Persons should not seek employment in their professional capacity in the publicly-funded health service in Ireland unless and until their qualifications have been recognised.</P>
        <P>Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health and Children is the Competent Authority for the profession in question; the process is administered by the National Validation Office of the Health Service Executive (NVO) which is advised by the relevant professional body.</P>
        <P>For the profession of the person to whom the Deputy refers, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.</P>
        <P>Applications must be acknowledged within one month and the applicant informed of any missing document.  A final decision must be communicated to the applicant within four months of submission of a complete application.  These time frames are clearly signalled on the Department&rsquo;s and the NVO&rsquo;s websites.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the NVO that an application form and information relating to the recognition process were issued to this person on 8 June last.  It would be inappropriate to comment on any individual&rsquo;s application but I can assure the Deputy that when the completed application form is received, along with the relevant supporting documentation, it will be processed within the prescribed time frames.</P>

	<P>The bodies, including regulatory bodies funded by my Department in the years 2010-2012 are set out in the following table. My Department also administers a  National Lottery Discretionary Fund from which once-off grants are paid to community and voluntary organisations, providing a range of health related service. Details of the groups which have received funding for the past three years are set-out on my Departments website: <i>www.doh.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive also provides funding to numerous groups and organisations, details of which are set-out in its annual accounts, which are available on the Executives website:<i>www.hse.ie</i></P>
        <P>As part of the Estimates process each year, my Department and the Health Service Executive examine various options which might provide expenditure savings, while to the greatest extent possible meeting the objective of maintaining population health and access to services.  The question of further savings that can be made in this overall area, including as regards efficiencies in how State funding is allocated and monitored, will be kept under scrutiny.</P>

	<P>Under previous rounds of the Sports Capital Programme no funding has been allocated toward the project referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department has received an application for funding under the 2012 Sports Capital Programme for this project.</P>
        <P>Departmental officials have started processing all applications received.  This process will take some time, due to the volume of applications and the detailed information contained in each one.  As a result, I do not expect to be able to announce the list of successful applicants before the late autumn or early winter 2012.</P>
        <P>Under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme, which has been closed to new applicants since July 2000, a maximum grant of &euro;3.8m is available for a swimming pool in Castlebar.  There are four principal stages to be undertaken by the local authority in developing a swimming pool project.  These are preliminary report, contract documents, tender documents and construction. Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from the Department, and grant aid is formally allocated when the tender is approved. The preliminary report for a replacement pool in Castlebar was approved in April 2005.  When contacted by the Department earlier this year, Mayo County Council indicated that contract documents would be ready in November 2012.</P>
