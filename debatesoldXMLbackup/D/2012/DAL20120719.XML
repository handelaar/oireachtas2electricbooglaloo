      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>While it may not have cut the headline rate of social welfare payments, the Government made sharp and deep cuts in a raft of schemes that are very important to people, including the fuel allowance, family income supplement, community employment, T&uacute;s, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, child benefit, farm assist and, in particular, schemes that affect women.  For some reason, the Minister for Social Protection always seems to target women for her cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>No one takes that remark seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In the budget the Minister announced significant cutbacks of two thirds in the materials and training grants for the 22,000 people on community employment schemes, targeting a saving of &euro;36 million.  However, as a result of the backlash against this measure, she announced a review which we understand has been completed for some considerable time.  According to RTE, letters have been sent to some community employment providers informing them that their materials and training grants will be cut by between 30% and 40%.  When will the review be published and why has it not yet been published?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it being hidden from the House?  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the cuts that are being applied to the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes?  How many places will be lost and how many will be laid off the schemes as a result of Government action?</P>

	<P>Judging by the actions of the Labour Party, the T&aacute;naiste will not be on active service for long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Since this is the last day of this D&aacute;il session, I look forward to seeing the Deputy here regularly when we return in September.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the community employment programme which plays an important role in the provision of crucial services for rural and urban communities.  There are 1,143 community employment schemes in operation nationally.  Of the 23,300 places available, approximately 22,000 are for participants, while approximately 1,400 are full-time supervisor posts.  The overall estimated budget for the community employment scheme in 2012 will be approximately &euro;340 million.</P>
        <P>As part of the requirement to fix the hole left in the public finances by Fianna F&aacute;il, it is necessary to examine all aspects of expenditure across every Department.  It was against this background that the financial review of community employment schemes got under way a couple of months ago.  The main objective of the review was to identify areas where savings could be achieved through efficiencies in order that the best use could be made of available funds.  As a result of the review, significant savings have been made in the overheads of community employment projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.  The savings will increase next year as some projects had incurred these costs prior to the introduction of the new arrangements.  Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support.  Instead, they will be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs necessarily incurred by the individual scheme, having regard to the overall level of funding available to the community employment programme nationally.</P>
        <P>The materials and training budget for the community employment programme has been increased by &euro;9.5 million from the original budget of approximately &euro;11 million, following savings identified elsewhere in the budget of the Department of Social Protection.  The new materials and training budget is thus &euro;20.5 million.  Each community employment scheme has been notified of its revised materials and training allocation based on the amounts recommended by the Department&rsquo;s divisional staff, following consultations with schemes.  The majority of schemes have indicated satisfaction with their revised allocation in these difficult economic times.  In addition to the training allocation for schemes, community employment scheme participants may also access a number of Springboard, vocational educational committee and F&Aacute;S courses free of charge.  As a result of the community employment scheme review process, the Minister for Social Protection has also introduced an appeals mechanism for schemes which believe they are unable to survive on the new allocations for training and materials.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that a separate policy review of labour activation schemes is under way.  This review which is nearing completion will also help to inform the Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to these schemes, including community employment schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>When responsibility for community employment schemes was transferred to the Department of Social Protection, it was intended to spend some of the &euro;5 billion we paid people to do nothing, which was bad for their health and well-being, on providing people who were out of work with opportunities to make a useful contribution to society.  In other words, we viewed people not as a burden but as a resource.  The Government appears to think otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the ESRI has made it clear in its review that the 2012 budget imposed a higher percentage of losses on those with low incomes?  When will the review be published?  Will the T&aacute;naiste provide details of the average cut per scheme across the country in order that we know exactly what has been done to community employment schemes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a hard neck to lecture the Government on community employment schemes, the budget or the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to use the opportunity offered by the final Leader&rsquo;s Questions of this D&aacute;il session to firmly rule out any attempt to curtail further entitlements to medical cards, as proposed yesterday by the IMF.  Will he also rule out Government consideration of an attack on child benefit?</P>
        <P>When the Cabinet met last Tuesday to sign off on the Health Service Executive Governance Bill 2012, was any indication given by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, of the decision by the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, to tender his resignation?  When and how did the T&aacute;naiste learn of Mr. Magee&rsquo;s decision?  How does he explain the situation where his party colleague and Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, indicated that she had only learned of Mr. Magee&rsquo;s decision through the media and, correctly, expressed her regret?  Does he agree with her comment that his departure was a &ldquo;significant blow&rdquo; to the health service?  How would the T&aacute;naiste describe the relationship between the Minister for Health and the Minister of State in their respective roles in the Department?  Are they even on speaking terms?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that the health budget allocation in 2012 was such that the targeted so-called savings were unrealisable, with a &euro;750 million cut this year built on a cut of &euro;1 billion in the previous year?  Does he accept that these are unrealisable targets and that we have burdened health service delivery management with an unattainable target for this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about the statement made by the IMF on child benefit and other matters.  The statement issued yesterday by the IMF is different from the quarterly review of the Irish programme carried out by the troika.  The statement was issued under what is known as Article 4, which is a very different process from the quarterly troika programme review mission and has a different focus and rationale.  The quarterly programme review by the IMF, the European Union and the ECB focuses on short-term issues and our adherence to the agreed commitments in the programme.  The Article 4 process which was announced yesterday by the IMF has a strategic focus and considers medium to long-term policy themes.</P>
        <P>We should welcome the comments made by the IMF on our steadfast efforts to deal with the banking crisis and implementation of fiscal consolidation measures, despite an adverse external environment that has tested confidence and delayed recovery.  The IMF outlined medium to long-term recommendations to the Government.  They were not made specifically in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget or the programme.  The issue of next year&rsquo;s budget is one the Government has yet to address and at this point in the year it is not appropriate to speculate about what may be included in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Rule it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to clarify that the IMF statement was the result of a different process from that which refers to the Irish programme.  </P>
        <P>In regard to what is discussed during Cabinet meetings, it is a long-standing practice that we do not share this information outside the Cabinet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>When was the T&aacute;naiste told?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste failed to answer my questions directly.  I asked him to avail of the opportunity to state firmly and clearly that no countenance would be given to the IMF&rsquo;s recommendation of a further curtailment of access to medical cards.  He has not ruled this out.  He spoke in vague terms about what might happen some point down the road, but he has not ruled this out, nor has he ruled out any attack on child benefit.  This was his opportunity to put these ideas firmly to bed.  They should not be matters for consideration, whether in the upcoming budget or any future budget.  When will the T&aacute;naiste and the Labour Party draw the line in respect of these matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>They cannot see the line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked about the matter of the departure of Cathal Magee.  The T&aacute;naiste will not share with us the so-called confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you are over time.  You have had one minute.  Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the T&aacute;naiste again.  When and how did he become aware of Mr. Magee&rsquo;s decision?  What does the T&aacute;naiste believe to be the current relationship between the Labour Party Minister of State at the Department of Health and the senior Minister with responsibility there?  Is it not clear that the T&aacute;naiste has had to assert his and his party&rsquo;s position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Come on, Deputy, please.  You are over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a court martial.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we hear the T&aacute;naiste, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s relationship with Deputy Adams?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the statement from the IMF was not in the context of the programme that we are operating or next year&rsquo;s budget.  It was under the Article IV process which involves medium to long-term recommendations.  It is not a case of ruling out something in terms of next year&rsquo;s budget.  These are recommendations made for the long term.  The IMF does this for every country; it is a periodic thing done under the Article IV process.  It is not something the Government has to follow and it is not part of the programme.  We will deal with the issues relating to the budget when we come to budget time and when the Government makes decisions in respect of the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about my question about Mr. Magee?  I hope the T&aacute;naiste is not hiding behind the Ceann Comhairle.  Surely the T&aacute;naiste will answer that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The House is anticipating and will welcome the announcement of an inquiry into the bank guarantee of September 2008.  The sooner it comes, the better.  I say as much because I believe we are in danger of repeating the mistakes of 2008 unless we are particularly vigilant.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that there are banking scandals breaking globally.  Giants such as Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HSBC are the subject of investigations in the USA and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>We have had our own problems with Ulster Bank but there has been another more sinister development in recent days.  When the Ulster Bank scandal began to break here, Bank of Ireland made an announcement which raises the question of whether the Government is really hands-on with the banks.  It announced a new governor in a press release one day after the Ulster Bank scandal started to break.  No one really noticed what was happening when it did so but it was important for the Government for two reasons: first, because Bank of Ireland is part of the Government&rsquo;s pillar bank strategy, and second, because it holds 15% of Bank of Ireland and has two directors on the board.  The governor was recruited from Lloyds TSB.  It is not in the press release but Lloyds TSB is the subject of a serious investigation and was found to have mis-sold more than &pound;3 billion worth of personal protection insurance less than two years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the T&aacute;naiste aware that the appointee to the post of governor of the Bank of Ireland was the director in charge of insurance at that time and had his bonus docked by &pound;250,000, which is somewhat unique for a banker?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost impossible for that to happen.  Was the T&aacute;naiste kept informed of this by the public interest directors?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is determined to get to the bottom of what happened on the night of the bank guarantee by holding a banking inquiry.  The objective is to ensure that we have the most effective mechanism to get to the truth of it.  Our focus is on having the most robust form of inquiry within the confines of the Constitution and to shed as much light as we can on who was involved politically and administratively in the decision-making process that lumbered this State with a debt-ridden situation, which we are working hard to undo now.  Since the outcome of last October&rsquo;s referendum, a substantial and detailed analysis has been carried out on the scope for Oireachtas inquiries operating within the parameters set out in the Abbeylara judgment.  The main conclusions of this legal assessment are summarised in the letter from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts which issued following the Government&rsquo;s consideration of options for an Oireachtas inquiry on banking matters at the end of last month.</P>
        <P>The technical problems at Ulster Bank are having a significant effect on the bank&rsquo;s personal and business customers throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He is moving on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is totally unacceptable that it has taken Ulster Bank so long to deal with these problems.  With regard to the other issue mentioned by the Deputy, Bank of Ireland is substantially a private company and I was not informed of the governor&rsquo;s background.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.  The Bank of Ireland was largely privately owned when the last disaster occurred in 2008.  The reason we have a 15% holding, which had been larger, and two public interest directors is that it is such a vital part of the Irish economy.  The appointment of its governor is a crucial decision in which the Government obviously has a key interest.  My guess is that the Government did not know anything about his history, his pedigree, the mis-selling scandal at Lloyds TSB or the fact that he was a director at the time and was forced to give up his bonus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did not want to know about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no wish to be too specific.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question?  Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me, generally, are the public interest directors doing anything in these banks?  If they did not inform the Government about the pedigree and the detailed history of the person who was to be the governor of the Bank of Ireland then they were not doing their job.

	<P>As I have said, I was not aware of the individual&rsquo;s background.  Bank of Ireland is 85% privately owned.  Deputy Ross would be the first to criticise the Government were it seen to be somehow micro-managing the affairs of the bank.  The questions Deputy Ross is asking about the communication between the public interest directors and the Minister for Finance are matters that should appropriately be addressed to the Minister for Finance by way of direct parliamentary questions.</P>

As we rise today I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, all of the staff of the Houses, the Members, the press and everybody who works here for their co-operation and the amount of work they have put in.  I wish Members of the House an enjoyable break from their endeavours.  I do not think any Member of the House who will go on holidays for the full duration of the recess.  In practical terms, committees will be back at the beginning of September and I am aware political parties will have their seminars and preparatory meetings in the early part of September, but I want to wish everybody who works in the Houses, Members, press and everybody who is associated with the work here a break and a rest during the course of the recess.</P>

It is very important that we do our job well in this House but we have duties beyond this House, both in our constituencies and nationally, as national politicians.  There is no way we can reflect the views of the people in this House if we are not out among the people around the country.  Everybody in this House knows that the notion sometimes purveyed that when we are not here, we are not working is false.  I have no doubt that, as the T&aacute;naiste said, most of the Members of this House would be lucky to get two weeks holidays and for the rest of the time they will be working at the other elements of this job, which are equally important.  It also gives us an opportunity to do research, and I know from Ministers that they will use the time to have meetings in their Departments and to discuss policy issues.  I join the T&aacute;naiste in wishing you, a Cheann Comhairle, and everybody the best over the summer period and we will be fighting fit come the autumn.</P>

Rinneadh iarracht nuair a bh&iacute; an obair seo ar bun ag an Rialtas deireanach go mbeadh p&aacute;irt l&aacute;rnach ag na p&aacute;irtithe uile san Oireachtas san obair seo. Anois agus athr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar bhun-reachta&iacute;ocht n&iacute; amh&aacute;in na Gaeltachta ach na Gaeilge, n&iacute;l an tAire St&aacute;it glacadh le haon leas&uacute; sa D&aacute;il n&oacute; sa Seanad. In ionad pobal na Gaeilge agus iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; b&aacute;&uacute;il don Ghaeilge a aont&uacute; taobh thiar den iarracht mh&oacute;r ar son na Gaeilge, t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag coth&uacute; scaoilte. Ag tabhairt isteach an Bille seo, at&aacute; lochtach go bun&uacute;sach, t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag tabhairt isteach Bille gan aon acmhainn&iacute; taobh thiar d&oacute;, Bille a bhaineann cearta daonlathacha de phobal na Gaeltachta agus a chuireann daoine nach bhfuil aon bhaint n&oacute; eolas ag formh&oacute;r acu ar an nGaeltacht i mbun roghn&uacute; ionadaithe an phobail ar son na Gaeltachta, Bille a leag an c&uacute;ram plean&aacute;la ar na pobail gan acmhainn&iacute; agus a sh&eacute;anann freagracht an St&aacute;it, Bille a thugann ceannas do fhoras taobh amuigh den dl&iacute;nse seo ar ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; an St&aacute;it seo. Bille nach gcuireann an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge i bhfeidhm. N&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; f&oacute;s, is Bille &eacute; seo nach bhfuil aon taca&iacute;ocht ann d&oacute; &oacute; na daoine is gn&iacute;omha&iacute; i saol na Gaeilge agus i saol na Gaeltachta. Iarraim ar an Aire St&aacute;it don uair dheireanach seasamh siar &oacute; bhruach na haille agus C&eacute;im an Choiste don Bhille seo a chur siar go dt&iacute; an f&oacute;mhar.

T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; in easnamh freisin.  Tugann an Bille seo neamhaird ar dheiseanna at&aacute; ann chun fuinneamh a an&aacute;il ar ais sa Ghaeltacht.  B&rsquo;fhurasta na heasnaimh sin a r&eacute;iteach d&aacute; mbeadh an Rialtas i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin nGaeilge agus faoin bpr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in leis na heagrais Ghaeilge, agus d&aacute; mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin bpr&oacute;iseas daonlathach san Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; an Ghaeilge in &aacute;it na leathphingine sa St&aacute;t seo.  I rith na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta gairide, chualamar beag&aacute;n n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; l&eacute;irisc fholamha &oacute;n Rialtas agus uaireanta, focail nimhneacha, ar n&oacute;s &ldquo;language imperialists&rdquo;, mar a thug an Teachta Creed ar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  Ag coiste inn&eacute;, d&uacute;irt an Teachta Flanagan go raibh s&eacute; in &eacute;adan airgead a chaitheamh ar eolas sl&aacute;inte a fhoilsi&uacute; i nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>T&aacute;imid ag teacht chuig deireadh na bliana, bliain inar rinne an Rialtas an-dochar don Ghaeilge, dochar don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, dochar do na Gaelscoileanna agus dochar do sc&eacute;im labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ba dh&eacute;istineach a fheice&aacute;il an Rialtas ag bagairt ar Dh&oacute;nal &Oacute; Cn&aacute;imhs&iacute;, a labhair ar son Ghuth na Gaeltachta.  Is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil suim d&aacute; laghad ag an Roinn n&oacute; ag an Rialtas pl&eacute; oscailte daonlathach a dh&eacute;anamh anseo inniu.  Mar sin, di&uacute;lta&iacute;mid leis an bpr&oacute;iseas ina ioml&aacute;ine.  N&iacute;limid s&aacute;sta fanacht anseo agus imeoimid chun &aacute;r nd&eacute;istin a chur in i&uacute;l faoin &aacute;bhar seo.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; agus t&aacute;im ag r&aacute; go gairid gur t&uacute;s maith &eacute; an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach agus is &eacute; t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.  Ach an dara leath an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; anois.  T&aacute; fadhb leis an dara leath toisc nach bhfuil an Rialtas s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht le heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ina gcro&iacute; acu maidir le hathruithe gur ceart a dh&eacute;anamh don Bhille seo.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir su&iacute; anseo ar feadh na n-uaireanta, dul tr&iacute;d an Bhille go foirme&aacute;lta agus gan aon mholadh substainti&uacute;il a ghlacadh &oacute;s na daoine a dteasta&iacute;onn uathu an Bille, agus todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta, a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>R&aacute;im&eacute;is amach is amach an m&eacute;id ad&uacute;irt an T&aacute;naiste ar maidin mar gheall ar an Dara Ch&eacute;im, gur chr&iacute;ochn&aacute;igh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht go luath agus go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; go mb&eacute;adh n&iacute;os m&oacute; Teachta&iacute; ag caint.  N&iacute; shin an cheist.  Is &iacute; an cheist n&aacute; conas ar f&eacute;idir an Bille a athr&uacute;.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir an Bille a athr&uacute; ar an Dara Ch&eacute;im nuair at&aacute; daoine ag d&eacute;anamh tairiscint&iacute; ginear&aacute;lta.  Is ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste ar cheart na hathraithe a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.</P>
        <P>Iarraim ar an Rialtas &eacute;isteacht le heagrais na Gaeltachta agus na Gaoluinne agus le daoine a bhfuil an Ghaoluinn ina gcro&iacute; acu conas gur f&eacute;idir an Bille a dh&eacute;anamh i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr agus, d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, gn&iacute;omh i bhfad n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm chun an teanga a chaomhn&uacute; agus chun borradh agus bl&aacute;th a chur faoin dteanga, chun deireadh a chur le b&aacute;n&uacute; na Gaeltachta agus chun an Ghaoluinn agus an Ghaeltacht a chaomhn&uacute; agus a chur i mbl&aacute;th ar&iacute;s.</P>

	<P>Ar a laghad, t&aacute; deis agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoin Bhille stairi&uacute;il seo, Bille na Gaeltachta, an ch&eacute;ad Bhille Gaeltachta a tugadh isteach sa Teach seo &oacute; thug Riste&aacute;rd &oacute; Maolchatha isteach an ch&eacute;ad Bhille Gaeltachta i 1956.  Is fada at&aacute; muintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht na Gaeilge ag fanacht le Bille eile Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; an Bille &aacute; thabhairt isteach mar go dtuigeann muid go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im sa t&iacute;r, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r sa Ghaeltacht, maidir le labhairt na teanga.</P>
        <P>Nuair a fh&eacute;achann muid ar an toradh a bh&iacute; le daon&aacute;ireamh 2011, bh&iacute; 97,000 duine ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; ins an Ghaeltacht agus n&iacute; d&uacute;irt ach 23,000 acu, duine as gach ceathrar, go labhra&iacute;onn siad an Ghaeilge go laeth&uacute;il.  D&uacute;irt na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ag caint liom, go gcaithfear rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.  D&uacute;radh sa suirbh&eacute; teangeola&iacute;ochta a th&aacute;inig amach i 2007 &mdash; suirbh&eacute; a chuir saineolaithe teanga as an t&iacute;r seo agus t&iacute;ortha eile amach &mdash; muna dtugfar aghaidh ar an fhadhb at&aacute; le labhairt na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute; nach mbeadh aon Ghaeltacht f&aacute;gtha sa t&iacute;r tar &eacute;is idir 15 agus 20 bliain.  Sin a d&uacute;radh sa suirbh&eacute; is &uacute;dar&aacute;sa&iacute; d&aacute;r cuireadh ar f&aacute;il le mo linnse.  Bh&iacute; saineolas agus taighde domhain ag baint leis an suirbh&eacute; sin a rinneadh ar fud na Gaeltachta&iacute; ar fad agus th&aacute;ngthas an&iacute;os leis an dearcadh sin.  Muna nd&eacute;antar rud &eacute;igin taobh istigh de 15 bliain agus 20 bliain, n&iacute; bheidh aon chainteoir d&uacute;chais sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>D&rsquo;&eacute;ist m&eacute; leis an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, a shi&uacute;l amach lena chuid Teachta&iacute; as an D&aacute;il, agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go bhfuil muid ar bhruach na haille.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; easaonta&iacute;m le sin.  T&aacute;imid ar bhruach na haille.  We are on the precipice, mar adeir siad i mB&eacute;arla, as far as the continuation of the language being a living language in Gaeltacht areas is concerned.  T&aacute; m&eacute; buartha gur shi&uacute;l an Teachta amach as an Teach agus gur shi&uacute;l na Teachta&iacute; eile amach.  N&iacute; thuigim cad &eacute; an strait&eacute;is at&aacute; acusan.  T&aacute; strait&eacute;is 20 bliain againne agus t&aacute; Bille na Gaeltachta againn, ach cad &eacute; an strait&eacute;is acusan?  T&aacute; siad ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil go leor ama leis an mBille a phl&eacute;.  Is f&eacute;idir liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teach gur chaith muid deich uair a chloig, ten hours, ag pl&eacute; an Bhille seo i Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Chaith muid s&eacute; uair ag pl&eacute; an Bhille sa Teach seo agus bh&iacute; tr&iacute; uair eile le tabhairt don Bhille inniu.</P>
        <P>Mar ad&uacute;irt an T&aacute;naiste romham, bh&iacute; mise anseo seachtain &oacute; shin, D&eacute; hAoine seo caite, agus bh&iacute; pl&eacute; againn ar Ch&eacute;im a D&oacute; den Bhille, ach n&iacute; raibh aon duine anseo le labhairt.  N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig &eacute;inne isteach le labhairt.  B&rsquo;&eacute;igean dom brath ar na Teachta&iacute; &oacute; thaobh an Rialtais, go dt&iacute; nach raibh &eacute;inne f&aacute;gtha.  Cad a tharla ansin, ach thit an t&oacute;in as an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus b&rsquo;&eacute;igean d&uacute;inn &iacute; a chur ar ceal.  N&iacute; raibh &eacute;inne anseo chun an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a choinne&aacute;il ar si&uacute;l.  Anois, t&aacute;thar ag r&aacute; go gcaitfidh muid an t-am a chur siar mar nach bhfuil go leor ama againn chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh, ach nuair a bh&iacute; an t-am againn an tseachtain seo chaite, n&iacute; raibh siad anseo.  Mar sin, n&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute; chomh d&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus at&aacute; siad.  N&iacute;or mhaith liomsa a r&aacute; le duine ar bith gur sin fim&iacute;nteacht.  N&iacute;or mhaith liom hypocrisy a chur i leith duine ar bith mar is rud m&oacute;r &eacute; sin.  Ach m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leo inniu agus maidir leis an rud a tharla an tseachtain seo caite, is cinnte go bhfuil comhartha ceiste m&oacute;r faoin d&aacute;ir&iacute;reacht at&aacute; i measc na ndaoine a shi&uacute;l amach as an Teach.  B&iacute;onn siad ag caint ar daonlathas agus c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an daonlathas.  Creidim i gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa daonlathas agus sa ch&oacute;ras daonlathach, ach n&iacute; sh&iacute;lim gur comhartha maith ar an daonlathas daoine at&aacute; tofa go daonlathach ag si&uacute;l amach gan p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht th&aacute;bhachtach seo a bhaineann len &aacute;r teanga d&uacute;chais, c&eacute;ad teanga na t&iacute;re.</P>
        <P>Is fada muid ag s&uacute;il leis an mBille seo.  Th&aacute;inig tuairisc choimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta amach i 2002, th&aacute;inig an suirbh&eacute; teangeola&iacute;ochta amach ina dhiaidh sin, phl&eacute; comhchoiste an Oireachtais an &aacute;bhar agus ghlac an Rialtas a th&aacute;inig romhainn agus an Rialtas seo leis an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; c&uacute;ig bhliain imithe thart cheana f&eacute;in &oacute; th&aacute;inig an tuaireasc &oacute;n suirbh&eacute; saineola&iacute;ochta amach.  Sin an f&aacute;th nach bhfuil fonn ormsa n&iacute;os m&oacute; moillead&oacute;ireachta a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Bille seo.  T&aacute;imid ag cur ruda&iacute; ar an mh&eacute;ar fhada le blianta.  Bh&iacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v anseo, agus t&aacute; meas agam air.  Fear &eacute; a rugadh agus a t&oacute;gadh i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath agus chuaigh s&eacute; siar agus thosaigh s&eacute; ag c&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh mise sa Ghaeltacht.  Bh&iacute; an Teachta mar Aire sa Rialtas le blianta fada.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge mar theanga aitheanta ag leibh&eacute;al na hEorpa agus mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il anseo, ach t&aacute; laigeacht ar an talamh.  Sin an &aacute;it a raibh an c&uacute;l&uacute; agus an tr&aacute;.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil mise agus an Roinn &mdash; gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le hoifigigh na Roinne agus na daoine go l&eacute;ir a thug cuidi&uacute; dom &mdash; ag iarraidh an Bhille seo a chur tr&iacute;d an Teach.  Mar a d&uacute;irt duine &eacute;igin sa ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ar inn&eacute;, t&aacute;imid ag tabhairt l&aacute;imhe do mhuintir na Gaeltacht ina gini&uacute;int teanga f&eacute;in.  We are affording the people of the Gaeltacht a direct say in their own linguistic future.</P>
        <P>N&iacute;l easpa daonlathais ann.  T&aacute;imid ag dul chuig muintir na Gaeltachta agus go dt&iacute; na pobail sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  T&aacute; an Ghaeltacht roinnte suas i 19 ceantar, 19 separate areas, agus t&aacute; muid ag tabhairt cuiridh &mdash; invitation &mdash; do gach ceantar acu sin, do na daoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge agus at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; ansin agus ag t&oacute;gaint a dteallaigh le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;&iacute;m ann.  T&aacute; an B&eacute;arla ag br&uacute; isteach agus ba mhaith linn an Ghaeilge a choinne&aacute;il beo sa Ghaeltacht.  Na ceisteanna at&aacute; &aacute; chur againn n&aacute; cad is f&eacute;idir linn a dh&eacute;anamh.  Cad a mheasann daoine at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht for many generations faoi conas gur f&eacute;idir linn stop a chur leis an tr&aacute;&uacute; seo agus an taoide a chasadh ar&iacute;s?</P>
        <P>Sin daonlathas.  Go dt&iacute; seo bh&iacute; gach Rialtas ag r&aacute; go gcaithfear &eacute; seo n&oacute; &eacute; si&uacute;d a dh&eacute;anamh &mdash; do this, do that.  N&iacute; raibh ag &eacute;ir&iacute; leis.  D&aacute; mb&eacute;adh ag &eacute;ir&iacute; leis ni bh&eacute;adh aon Ch&eacute;im inniu.  N&iacute;or &eacute;irigh leis sin.  Anois, t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh mar a mhol Seosamh Mac Grianna, ceann de scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; m&oacute;ra na Gaeilge, i 1932 agus t&aacute;imid ag tabhairt focal do mhuintir na  Ghaeltachta ina gcinni&uacute;int f&eacute;in.  T&aacute;imid ag ligint d&oacute;ibh teacht an&iacute;os lena bpleananna f&eacute;in.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Ach n&iacute;limid ag cur an t-ualach uilig ar na pobail Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;imid chun cabhair agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag d&eacute;anamh leas&uacute; ioml&aacute;n ar r&oacute;l &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Beidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ansin.  N&iacute; bheidh 20 duine ar bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Beidh 12 air.  Beidh cead ag comhairl&iacute; contae ina bhfuil ceantair Gaeltachta c&uacute;igear duine a ainmni&uacute; le dul ar an mbord agus beidh cead ag an Rialtas seachtar a chur air.  Daoine a mbeidh saineolas agus tuiscint acu ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta, ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; s&oacute;isialta agus ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga a bh&eacute;as iontu.  Beimid ag cur f&oacute;gra ar <i>postannapoibli.ie</i> agus beimid ag tabhairt cuireadh do dhaoine ar fud na t&iacute;re a sh&iacute;leann go bhfuil rud &eacute;igin t&aacute;bhachtach le r&aacute; n&oacute; le cur ar f&aacute;il acu, chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an Ghaeilge, a gcuid iarratais agus a gcuid <i>curriculum vitae</i> a chur isteach.  Geallaim go mbeidh &uacute;dar&aacute;s an-chumasach ansin.  Beidh s&eacute; d&iacute;rithe isteach, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar thionscail agus ar fhosta&iacute;ocht, ach ar chaomh&uacute; na teanga ins na ceantair Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>M&aacute; fhaigheann an Ghaeilge b&aacute;s ins na ceantair Gaeltachta beidh an slabhra a th&eacute;ann siar dh&aacute; mh&iacute;le bliain briste.  N&iacute;l aon amhras orm n&aacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge go leor ar fud na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; an t&iacute;r taistealta agam, agus na Gaeltachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir, &oacute; ceapadh mar Aire St&aacute;it m&eacute;.  Chuaigh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; &aacute;iteacha cos&uacute;il le Cluain Dolc&aacute;in agus Ceatharlach, go h&aacute;iteacha i gContae an Chl&aacute;ir, go Carn T&oacute;chair i gContae Dhoire agus an Srath B&aacute;n ins an s&eacute; contaetha.  Feicim an rud at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l ansin, tuismitheoir&iacute; agus daoine coitianta agus com&oacute;nta ag r&aacute; gur fi&uacute; an Ghaeilge a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il agus go gcaithfimid rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba mhaith leo go mb&eacute;adh gaelscoil acu, go mbeadh a gclanna ag dul go dt&iacute; an ghaelscoil agus go mb&eacute;adh Gaeilge acu.  Nuair a bh&iacute;mse ag dul timpeall na t&iacute;re agus nuair a fheicim &eacute; sin is m&oacute;r an d&oacute;chas, an faoiseamh agus an s&aacute;samh a thugann s&eacute; dom.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil m&eacute; s&aacute;sta, ins an mBille &uacute;r, go mbeidh l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge ins na ceantair sin agus iad ceangailte leis an Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; an Bille ansin le tabhairt faoi na deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; ins an Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith s&aacute;sta leis sin.  Chuireamar a l&aacute;n oibre isteach ann.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaim&iacute;s &eacute; a chur siar cupla bliain eile, ach seo an Bille is fearr d&aacute; dt&aacute;inig muid an&iacute;os leis.  D&rsquo;&eacute;isteamar le daoine agus leis an rud a bh&iacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; leasaithe th&iacute;os ag moladh go mb&eacute;adh toghch&aacute;n ann do &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Shocair an Rialtas cupla uair an m&oacute;dh &uacute;r.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s &uacute;r a bheidh anseo.  N&iacute;limid ag cuimhni&uacute; ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s a chuaigh thart.  Rinne s&eacute; an-chuid oibre.  Chothaigh s&eacute; postanna ins an Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; mise an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il, mar Aire St&aacute;it sa Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, le cabhair &oacute;n Aire agus &oacute;n Rialtais ar fad, gur &eacute;irigh linn &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta a choinne&aacute;il.  Bh&iacute; cinneadh beagnach d&eacute;anta deireadh a chur leis.  Chonaic muid go raibh an bord snip nua chun deireadh a chur leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Beidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ann.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is priomhfheidhmeannach &uacute;r a chur isteach ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus achmhainn&iacute; caipitil a thabhairt d&oacute;, chomh maith leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; aige anuraidh.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is r&oacute;l &uacute;r a thabhairt d&oacute; chomh maith, is &eacute; sin na ceantair plean&aacute;la teanga a fhorbairt.  Beidh taca&iacute;ocht an &uacute;dar&aacute;is le f&aacute;il ag na ceantair Gaeltacht agus ag gn&aacute;th mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt dos na comharchumainn agus dos na heagrais deonacha eile at&aacute; ag saothr&uacute; ar fud na Gaeltacht agus ar fud na t&iacute;re, l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae agus seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine, ag cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l acu-san chomh maith.  N&iacute;l an Rialtas ann f&eacute;in n&oacute; an Bille ann f&eacute;in chun an Ghaeilge a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il ins an Ghaeltacht, ach tugann s&eacute; strucht&uacute;r d&uacute;inn agus cuireann s&eacute; an strucht&uacute;r ar bun.  Ag &eacute;ir&iacute; amach as sin, beim&iacute;d &aacute;balta dul ar aghaidh agus na pleananna teanga a dh&eacute;anamh, mar sin an moladh idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  Leagfaidh gach ceantar s&iacute;os sprioc agus cusp&oacute;ir.  Beidh barra ansin, cad &eacute; mar at&aacute; an Ghaeilge ins an cheantar i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus c&eacute;n d&oacute;igh gur f&eacute;idir feabhas a chur uirthi.  Beidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; ag teacht isteach ann.  Ba mhaith liom go mb&eacute;adh gach duine ins an Ghaeltacht, agus i ngach p&aacute;irt den t&iacute;r, &aacute;balta a chuid oibre agus a chuid gn&oacute;ithe a dh&eacute;anamh leis na Ranna St&aacute;it tr&eacute; Ghaeilge n&oacute; tr&eacute; Bh&eacute;arla.  Sin an sprioc a bheimid ag iarraidh a bhaint amach.</P>
        <P>T&aacute;imid ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais ins an Ghaeltacht &aacute;rdaithe 25%, an sprioc at&aacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Th&aacute;inig titim uaf&aacute;sach ar an l&iacute;on &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t.  Nuair a buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t, deirtear liom, bh&iacute; 250,000 duine a raibh an Ghaeilge acu l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin anuas anois go dt&iacute; 23,000, sin titim de 90% &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t.  Muna gcuirtear stad leis sin n&iacute; bheidh aon Ghaeltacht f&aacute;gtha.  Sin an rud at&aacute; taobh thiar de seo: ceantair plean&aacute;la strait&eacute;ise teanga; an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s ag teacht isteach chun cuidi&uacute; leis na pobail a bpleananna f&eacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh amach; oiread achmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; againn a chur ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh; agus na pleananna a thabhairt chun cr&iacute;che.  D&eacute;anfar monat&oacute;ireacht ar na pleananna bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus m&aacute; t&aacute; aon cheantar Gaeltachta nach bhfuil fonn ar an phobal a bheith istigh ins an phlean beidh impleachta&iacute; aige sin do theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis na tuairim&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht &oacute;n Ghaeltacht f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; daoine a deir liomsa gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn teorainneacha na Gaeltachta a athr&uacute; l&aacute;ithreach, sula nd&eacute;anaimid aon rud, agus an Ghaeltacht a ghearradh siar.  N&iacute; aonta&iacute;m leis sin.  Caithfimid seans a thabhairt dos na pobail seo agus c&oacute;ras cu&iacute;, due process, a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.  Beidh seans ag na pobail seo a bpleananna a chur i l&aacute;thair.  M&aacute; chuireann ceantar plean maith isteach agus m&aacute; ghlacaim f&eacute;in agus an Roinn leis, rachaidh an pobal ar aghaidh agus beidh gach cuidi&uacute; agus taca&iacute;ocht le f&aacute;il acu.  M&aacute; thoileann pobal nach fi&uacute; plean a dh&eacute;anamh beidh impleachtai aige sin do theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute;l mise ag iarraidh balla a chur thart ar cheantair an-bheaga a bhfuil an Ghaeilge l&aacute;idir iontu.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh deis a thabhairt dos na ceantair ar fad, iad san a bhfuil an teanga l&aacute;idir iontu agus na h&aacute;iteacha nach bhfuil s&iacute; l&aacute;idir, dul ar aghaidh le ch&eacute;ile.  Ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine.</P>
        <P>N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag iarraidh dul ar ais go dt&iacute; an rud a tharla ins an Roinn Oideachais ins na blianta a chuaigh thart nuair a bh&iacute;odh streaming ar si&uacute;l ins na scoileanna. T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh cainteoir&iacute; le mixed ability a bheith le ch&eacute;ile chun cuidi&uacute; lena ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint ar na ruda&iacute; seo le blianta fada agus s&iacute;lim gur sin an d&oacute;igh is fearr chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>Taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht beidh r&oacute;l an-th&aacute;bhachtach ag Foras na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; Foras na Gaeilge ag gn&iacute;omh&uacute; ins an Tuaisceart agus ins an Deisceart.  Molaim an obair at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l aige.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ins an Tuaisceart agus chonaic m&eacute; cad &eacute; ata ar si&uacute;l ansin maidir le cur chun cinn na teanga.  Ins an taobh seo den t&iacute;r, beidh s&eacute; de fhreagracht ar Fhoras na Gaeilge cuidi&uacute; leis na ceantair nach bhfuil ins an Ghaeltacht an teanga &aacute; bhr&uacute; ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; an foras &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh cheana f&eacute;in agus leanfaidh s&eacute; ar aghaidh leis an r&oacute;l sin.  T&aacute; mise iontach d&oacute;chasach go mbeidh s&eacute; &aacute;balta sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>Agus m&eacute; ag breathn&uacute; thart, s&iacute;lim go bhfuil m&eacute; sa Teach n&iacute;os faide n&aacute; &eacute;inne eile.  T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo le breis agus 30 bliain.  Bhi suim agam i gc&oacute;nai i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Is &iacute; an Ghaeilge mo ch&eacute;ad theanga agus n&iacute;or mhaith liom go gcaillf&iacute; an Ghaeilge ins an Ghaeltacht.  Nuair a bh&eacute;as mo sheal thart mar Aire St&aacute;it agus nuair a thiocfas an ch&eacute;ad Aire eile, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ag f&aacute;s ins an Ghaeltacht is ag teacht chun cinn.</P>
        <P>Cuireann s&eacute; isteach orm, leis an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;, gur shi&uacute;il an Freas&uacute;ra amach inniu agus n&aacute;r ghlac Baill an Fhreas&uacute;ra an deis an tr&iacute; huaire a bh&iacute; againn chun a gcuid tuairim&iacute; a chur in i&uacute;l agus pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &aacute;bhar sin.  Caitheann siad cuireadh isteach anseo ar leataobh agus caitheann siad drochmheas ar an daonlathas f&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo an oiread sin ama agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; le mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; f&eacute;in, there are two matters on which the House has never divided for as long as I have been a Member.  One of these is the Irish language.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether it was Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la n&oacute; ag leibh&eacute;al na hEorpa, thug muid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; taca&iacute;ocht don Rialtas, c&eacute; go raibh muid thall ansin.  N&iacute; dhearna s&eacute; aon difr&iacute;ocht, thug muid an taca&iacute;ocht i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &oacute;n taobh sin den Teach.  Mheas muid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go raibh an teanga r&oacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach le scoilteadh uirthi.  Cuireann s&eacute; isteach orm mar dhuine a bhfuil meas agam ar an teanga, mar dhuine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta agus mar dhuine at&aacute; anseo le tamall fada ag troid an chatha, c&eacute; acu ar an taobh seo n&oacute; an taobh eile den Teach, ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go dtuigeann na heagra&iacute;ochta Gaeilge sin.  Na molta&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; na Gaeilge, bh&iacute; siad ag dul i gcoinne rationale an Bhille ar fad.  Bh&iacute; cinneadh d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas faoi dh&oacute;, agus na molta&iacute; a bh&iacute; d&eacute;anta, bh&iacute; siad ag dul in &eacute;adan spiorad an Bhille mar at&aacute;.  Sin an t-aon &aacute;bhar n&aacute;r scoilt muid i riamh uirthi agus m&eacute; istigh anseo, an Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>The second matter, as far as I recall, on which we never divided the House is the national question.  When things got hot and heavy in this country, when democracy was under sustained pressure as never before and when politicians were attacked &mdash; some were killed &mdash; while doing their duty and working on behalf of democracy, it would have been easy to split the House on the national question but we never did so.  We always put the national question ahead of mere political posturing.  I hope that what happened here this morning is not simply something as base as political posturing.  We had the opportunity to discuss this Bill on Friday last but while the Government managed to keep the debate going for a few hours, it eventually collapsed because no speakers were put forward by the Opposition.  I find it difficult to understand the strategy of walking out which the Opposition has adopted today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>We had enough street politics in this country for many years.  All we want now is to settle our differences in this Chamber.  It is very difficult to settle any differences when one is obliged to speak to empty benches on the other side of the House.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that what has happened here this morning does any great service to the Gaeltacht or to the ordinary people who live there.  The latter and other communities outside the Gaeltacht are seeking leadership in the context of what they can do to save the Irish language.  The Bill before the House is merely enabling legislation which provides the structure to allow us to devise plans to bring the language forward.  A national effort is going to be made in this regard and many Government Departments will be involved.  The Taoiseach and I attended a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on the future of the Irish language this morning at which we discussed various matters relating to the language.  A similar meeting was held in June and it is planned to hold another immediately after the recess.  D&uacute;irt duine &eacute;igin nach bhfuil an Rialtas seo i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  T&aacute; an Rialtas seo i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, t&aacute; an coiste ar bun agus bh&iacute; c&uacute;ig chruinni&uacute; ag an choiste sin.  Ar maidin, b&iacute;mid istigh ag 9 a.m. f&aacute; choinne c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Ghaeilge agus Ghaeltachta a phl&eacute;.  T&aacute; cruinni&uacute; eile socraithe don am nuair a thiocfaimid ar ais.  Choinnigh muid &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Is cinnte go bhfuilimid i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus t&aacute; an Rialtas ag tabhairt tosa&iacute;ochta don Bhille seo.</P>
        <P>I am aware that other Ministers and their Departments are lining up to introduce and enact legislation.  We have given priority to the legislation before the House because the Taoiseach, the cabinet sub-committee, everyone present in the House and the people of the Gaeltacht understand its importance.  The survey that was carried out illustrated the importance of the language.  N&iacute;l leithsc&eacute;al ar bith agam.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; a fhios ag achan duine cad &eacute; a bh&iacute; sa Bhille.  In May 2011, I announced what would happen to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the changes that would be made.  I also announced an mBille Teanga at that stage.  A number of months ago I announced what would be the composition of the board.  Thug muid isteach an sc&eacute;im taca&iacute;ochta teanga, the language support scheme, which allows us to focus our efforts in respect of young children.  What we are doing in this regard is telling parents &mdash; those who live in Gaeltacht areas and those who do not &mdash; that they have a choice in the context of deciding what will be their children&rsquo;s first language, namely, Irish or English.  By the time a child goes to school, his or her first language is already established.  I acknowledge the support we are receiving from the HSE, na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is sl&aacute;inte, in the context of the co-operation they are giving to us.  We are going into hospitals in order to inform people, immediately after their children are born, of the choice to which I refer.  If they decide that their children are to be raised through Irish, we provide them with an information package.  This package is being developed on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>These are new departures for the language.  The old ways did not work.  They certainly did not work in the Gaeltacht.  If we had not brought forward this Bill &mdash; the philosophy behind which is to give people a say in what is going to happen &mdash; I would be extremely pessimistic about the future.  In view of the structures we are establishing under the legislation, t&aacute; mise an-d&oacute;chasach go gcasfaidh an Bille an taoide agus go s&aacute;bh&aacute;ileoidh s&eacute; an teanga.</P>
        <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt do gach Teachta a th&aacute;inig isteach agus a labhair ar an Bhille seo.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt do gach Seanad&oacute;ir a th&aacute;inig isteach le c&uacute;pla seachtain agus a labhair ar an Bhille sa Teach eile.  Bh&iacute; siad go l&eacute;ir i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus rinne siad a gc&aacute;s sa Seanad agus sa Teach seo.  Labhair 20 Teachta istigh anseo.  A total of 20 Deputies from different parties and from among the ranks of the Independents contributed to the debate on the Bill.  Some of them spoke in Irish, while others made their contributions in English.  That is immaterial.  If a Member is genuine and wants to speak in English, I welcome that and it is fine by me.  I have never been someone to use a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  The latter approach has not worked.  We want to coax people to come along with us as part of this great movement.</P>
        <P>The centenary of the 1916 Rising is approaching.  We all know the part played by the Irish language and Conradh na Gaeilge and other Irish-speaking organisations in providing the leadership for that great revolution.  When the centenary takes place in 2016, nothing would give me greater pleasure than for there to be an indication that the response to the legislation has been positive.  Conradh na Gaeilge will celebrate its 120th anniversary next year, which is another important milestone in our linguistic history.  I appeal to it and to all the other language organisations that have been working hard for many years &mdash; often without recognition or acknowledgement &mdash; to our sporting, cultural and social organisations and to the voluntary committees to come along with us on this great expedition.  Let us all get involved and adopt the method of working together or to use the old Irish word &ldquo;meitheal&rdquo;, ag obair le ch&eacute;ile.</P>
        <P>We have nothing to lose by having our own language.  I have no intention of repeating myself but as I travelled throughout the country I discovered that there is a well of support for Irish.  When the census was taken last year, 1.77 million people expressed an interest in or an ability to speak Irish.  It is this enthusiasm, interest and support which we must harness.  I hope this Bill, which has been in preparation for so long and for which we have been waiting for over 50 years, will reignite the flame of the past, so that we go forward united.  We should forget political parties and affiliations.  The language should be above that.  In the past, perhaps it was associated with one party or another and it is still said that we are not serious about Irish.  I dismiss that as merely a political charge.  We all want to do the best, although we may have different approaches.  This is the framework in which we must work and I appeal to all Members of the House, leaders of the community, those who are elected, those who work in a voluntary capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Those who walked out may be listening to what we are saying.  It is a great pity they walked out and I hope I will never again experience anything like it.  It is more a reflection on Members of the Opposition than Members on the side.  We want to man the benches.  We fought hard to get here and we want to occupy the benches while we are here.  In the past, we were tempted to walk out but we did not.</P>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na daoine a chuir isteach molta&iacute;, le Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta, leis an suirbh&eacute; teangeola&iacute;ochta agus le h&eacute;inne a thug cuidi&uacute; n&oacute; comhairle d&uacute;inn maidir leis an mBille.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an Bille tr&iacute;d.  T&aacute; s&eacute; 56 bliain &oacute; inniu since the first Gaeltacht Bill was introduced.  In 56 years time, I will not be here but people around me may be.  When that time comes, I hope we will not be saying that the number of native speakers in the Gaeltacht has declined by 80% or 90%.  Nothing would give me greater pleasure than the turning of the tide as a result of this Bill so that we see an increase of 50% or 60%.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 seek to make the organisation and structure of political parties more transparent by requiring the information on what are called the accounting units of parties, that is, the local branches, to be included in the register of political parties.  This information will then be made publicly available.</P>
        <P>I am bringing forward 33 amendments, 31 of which address certain recommendations of the Mahon tribunal in regard to the financing of politics.  This is a sign of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to respond robustly and swiftly to the uncomfortable truths contained in that report.  I indicated in the House on 27 March that my Department was reviewing the recommendations made in the tribunal report with a view to facilitating early Government consideration of the need to bring forward amendments to this Bill.  Although anxious to ensure the legislation would be enacted as soon as possible, I undertook to examine those recommendations that were relevant to the Bill and amenable to being implemented by way of amendment.  The amendments I am presenting today represent the outcome of that consideration.</P>
        <P>The proposals I have made will make it an offence to give a political donation on behalf of another person without informing the recipient of the identity of the donor.  Donation declaration statements will have to include additional information on the sources of donations and how they were received and recorded by the recipient.  I propose to reduce the threshold for anonymous donations from IR&pound;100 to &euro;100.  Consequent to this amendment, the threshold will be reduced to &euro;100 for opening a political donations account for the registration of a third party with the Standards in Public Office Commission and in the definitions of political party accounting units and third parties.  Individual cash donations in excess of &euro;200 will be banned.  We will get to all of these amendments in due course.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 seek to address the following recommendation of the Mahon tribunal: &ldquo;Political parties should be required to supply details of their organisational structure, including their subsidiary organisations and branches, as a condition of registration under the Electoral Act 1992&rdquo;.  They will ensure there is greater transparency in regard to the organisational structure of political parties.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 17(1)(<i>b</i>) (as inserted by section 50(<i>c</i>) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001) of the Act of 1997 is amended by substituting &ldquo;by all candidates&rdquo; for &ldquo;by candidates of all qualified parties&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are four streams of funding for politicians and political life in this country.  First, all Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad receive an equal staffing allocation.  The second is the party leader&rsquo;s allowance which is paid in respect of every Member, except the Ceann Comhairle, although paid in a different manner to different Deputies.  The third is the Oireachtas staffing allowance paid to all Members other than Independents.  The fourth is the party funding under the Electoral Acts, for which any party receiving more than 2% of first preference votes in the preceding general election is eligible.  In the last election the citizens of Ireland chose to elect a sizeable number of Independent Deputies.  In fact, 17% of the membership of the House comprises Deputies not eligible for this funding.  The only groupings which qualify are the four large parties in the D&aacute;il, namely, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>What is happening is that 100% of the funding in this allocation goes to Members who represent only 83% of the popular mandate.  There is an opportunity to show respect for the wishes of the electorate by moving to address this anomaly.  If the 17% of funding which corresponds to the Independent representation in the House was returned to the Exchequer, it would amount to some &euro;800,000 per annum, or more than &euro;4 million in the lifetime of the D&aacute;il.  It is unacceptable that the parties should benefit disproportionately from this funding in a manner which ignores the substantial mandate of Independent Deputies.</P>
        <P>Another example of the failure to reflect the wishes of the electorate is the way in which the secretariat is provided for the party political system.  Even though the Technical Group is a recognised grouping in the House, the Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il make no provision for a secretariat to facilitate Members in their parliamentary functions.  Apart from not being provided with staff, we are not even given a computer or a telephone.  It is a very unfair system and an insult not only to Independent Members but also to the mandate they have received from the electorate.</P>
        <P>To clarify, I am not arguing for the withdrawal of funding for political parties.  On the contrary, I fully accept the valuable role they play in political life.  As I said on Committee Stage, I have been a member of no less than three political parties.  I did not intend for that to happen, but that is the way it worked out.</P>

	<P>The Deputy might well change her current status in due course.  She has a track record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot say what I might do in future.  As I said, I accept that political parties have their place.  Equally, however, there should be respect for Deputies who are not members of parties.  Since the establishment of the State, Ireland has had a history of electing significant numbers of Independents.  The funding to which I am referring was placed on a formalised footing in 1938 by de Valera&rsquo;s Government.  Independent representation has always been a feature of the House to a greater or lesser degree.  What I am proposing is that the portion of this funding which corresponds to the percentage of Independent representation in the House should not go into the pot for the parties to divide among themselves.  The total amount should be discounted by the 17% mandate given to Independents at the last general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, the argument we heard was that political parties get millions of euros extra funding because they have special duties and special things to do that Independent Deputies do not have to do.  I wonder what they are if we think about what we all contribute to parliamentary democracy.  My office comes up with policy, has plenty of administration, conducts local meetings &mdash; we held three public meetings on the referendum in Wicklow &mdash; and deals with the media.  I am curious as to what all these special duties parties&rsquo; have.  When I compare what I do and what my team and office do here and in Wicklow, it is not apparent to me that there are millions of euro extra things Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin does as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il,  although I am sure there are some.  I do not hold a convention during the year attended by lots of people but the argument that there are lots of things parties must do, such as devise policy, administration, hold local meetings and local administration which I, as an Independent Deputy do not have to do, does not stack up.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Murphy, I accept the argument for funding for political parties.  I am in no way against political parties.  I am an Independent Deputy because I decided to run for election about six weeks before the general election, and maybe none of the parties would have had me anyway.  A situation where Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin gets more than four times the funding per Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy than I get sounds imbalanced.  Maybe it is the case that every single Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy creates at least four times more value in our democracy than I do.  I do not think that is true but they get more than four times more money.</P>
        <P>The second argument is that the Technical Group has no secretariat.  As the Minister knows, the parties get 0.8 whole-time equivalents per Deputy but we do not get any.  Even if we did not take any additional money and even if the funding did not follow the Deputy, it is reasonable to say that, as a group, we can be most effective with some of the resources parties have, such as the ability to draft legislation, to have amendments reviewed by legal expertise and so on.  There is something to that.</P>
        <P>I would like a system whereby political funding followed the Deputy, as the Deputy is the person invested with the democratic mandate, and if Deputies want to form a party and pool their money, that is fine.  That is what I would advocate for.  Failing that, I would certainly advocate for some secretariat support for a group like the Technical Group in order for it to be as effective as possible and failing that, I would point to Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s final point.  Even if we want to continue a situation where Fianna F&aacute;il gets 4.3 times the funding per Deputy the Independents get and we think that is reasonable and we think it is reasonable that the second largest Opposition group does not get any secretariat support, which everybody else gets, at least save the rest of the money.  Currently, as Deputy Murphy pointed out, the extra money does not go back to the Exchequer but the parties get more because there is an unusual number of Independent Deputies.  Deputy Murphy&rsquo;s amendment talks to that quite well.  I do not imagine we will win this but for future consideration, I would appreciate it if the Minister would take those points on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that political parties are different from Independents.  Independents have a fair bit of financial support already through various other sources which members of political parties do not have.  We give that money to ensure we have a strong organisation and press and communications system in place.  I do not expect Deputy Murphy or Deputy Donnelly to have an apparatus in place which would support 35,000 members of a national organisation.  That is what the Fine Gael Party must support.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party must also support organisations.  Political parties have a lot of responsibility to their membership.  There is a lot more to supporting a political structure than being an individual.</P>
        <P>If we are to have a strong and cohesive parliamentary democracy and political system, it must be supported, otherwise we will have a collection of 166 Independents.  We would probably have elections on a very regular basis, which may suit some people, but it would not provide any stability or confidence to the country if we could not show that we could generate stability and confidence between political parties to have a programme for Government.  The same would apply to the Opposition in terms of research, press and communications and managing the structure of a political party, which is a fairly mammoth task.</P>
        <P>Obviously, people who have not been involved in political parties would not understand that.  Deputy Murphy, who was part of a political party in the past, should understand that there are a lot of responsibilities in terms of supporting the membership of a national organisation which she does not have to support currently.  She gets a considerable amount of resources from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which we must submit to our political parties for the purpose of meeting our obligations, structures and staffing, which she does not have to do.</P>
        <P>The balance is between whether one supports the political parties in the way they come together as a cohesive unit, albeit there will be differences within that unit in terms of policy propositions.  However, once they are decided, we must have the stability to follow them through.  Therefore, I reject the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact so many Independents were elected in the last general election is a reflection of the citizens&rsquo; choice and that cannot be ignored.  The words &ldquo;political party&rdquo; are not mentioned in the Constitution.  Political parties are to all intents and purposes private clubs focused on the political system.  Essentially, the resources provided to the Independents are provided to the political parties but to a much greater extent.  The leaders&rsquo; allowance is provided to the party leader.  One would have to question how much power the backbencher has.  Many Deputies have said to me and to others that they did not realise funding was provided by the Deputy to the party leader.  Much of this political funding is to provide a press office, which is there to maintain the situation.</P>
        <P>Parties produce a manifesto at election time but a constant bone of contention among the electorate is that many of the things in those manifestos are pious aspirations.  All of the policy which finds its way into the main document of the political party &mdash; people vote on what is presented to them &mdash; does not appear in the decisions made.  I will press the amendment as its acceptance would make a meaningful difference and have the effect of saving the Exchequer a substantial amount of money.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 12, 13, 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 37, 39 and 40 are related.  Amendment No. 31 is an alternative to amendment No. 30.  They will all be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 1 to 11 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) in paragraph (<i>aa</i>) (inserted by section 49(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Act of 2001) by&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) substituting &ldquo;&euro;100&rdquo; for &ldquo;&pound;100&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;accounting unit&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) substituting &ldquo;&euro;100&rdquo; for &ldquo;&pound;100&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;third party&rdquo;, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) inserting the following definitions:</P>
        <P LI="4">&ldquo; &lsquo;company&rsquo; means a company established under the Companies Acts;</P>
        <P LI="4">&lsquo;corporate donor&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) a body corporate,</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) an unincorporated body of persons, or</P>
        <P LI="4">(iii) a trust,</P>
        <P LI="4">which makes a donation, and for the purpose of this definition a body corporate and any subsidiary thereof shall be deemed to be one person;&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This group of amendments will have the effect of reducing the threshold for receipt of anonymous donations to &euro;100, the threshold for opening a political donations account to &euro;100 and to &euro;100 the threshold whereby a third party is recognised as such and must be registered.  A similar donation threshold of &euro;100 will also apply in the definition of &ldquo;accounting unit&rdquo; for a political party.  Each of the amendments flows from the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal regarding the treatment of anonymous donations.  The tribunal recommended that anonymous donations of more than &euro;55 to electoral candidates or elected representatives, or of more than &euro;175 to political parties be banned.  Currently all anonymous donations of more than &euro;126.97 are banned.  I agree with the principle behind the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendation but accepting the proposal would mean that the anonymous donation threshold for parties would increase, while the threshold for individuals would decrease.  As I do not favour increasing the threshold for parties, a reasonable way of implementing this recommendation is by reducing the threshold for all anonymous donations to &euro;100.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 31, tabled by Deputy Brian Stanley on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, is being discussed with this group because it seeks to amend the same section of the Bill as Government amendment No. 30, albeit for a different purpose.  The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is one of seven Sinn F&eacute;in amendments which seek to remove from the Bill the provisions dealing with corporate donations.  The purpose of the amendments is to ban corporate donations altogether, but, as I explained on Second Stage, this is not constitutionally feasible.  I will be opposing the amendment for this reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>There should, of course, be full transparency and accountability when it comes to any type of donation.  With regard to the specifics of anonymous donations, in the current economic climate I do not imagine there are too many people in the country willing to donate to any individual politician or group anonymously.  People would prefer for it to be known that they were giving funds provided they are in a position to do so.</P>
        <P>I have one thing to say about the major political parties in respect of funding.  They are unanimous about one thing when it comes to political funding for parties.  They must admit that they have a great advantage over the Independent candidates in this House and the Independent councillors throughout the country.  When it comes to election time Independents must fund and run their campaigns entirely on their own.  In recent years, given the increasing cost of advertising and everything that goes with a campaign, including posters and so on, considerable expenditure is needed to run a successful election campaign.  The major political parties are in agreement on one thing, that is, they would like to squeeze out the Independents if they could.  Thankfully, the people in the various constituencies see the merit in holding on to Independents.  Whether that will continue to be the case in future given the changes in the boundaries is a different tale.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, behind all the moves under way throughout the country there is a major move to try to squeeze out and put down Independents because the political parties do not want Independents to be here.  Ultimately, when it comes to funding, people should have the right to help out at election time by making donations, provided that it is all accounted for and that at the end of the election the candidate publicly discloses how much he got and where it came from.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
        <P>The political parties have so many other ways of fund-raising that Independents cannot avail of.  Other advantages arise from being a member of a political party.  Considering the way the whole thing is weighed up, it is a wonder that Independents are surviving, but thank God they are.  I hope there will always be Independents in the House.  They have served the country and the county councils well throughout the years and I hope they will continue to be here in the years ahead, in spite of what others in political parties would prefer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>My points are along the same lines.  I am surprised by what the Minister has said.  He maintains that Constitution would not allow him to ban all corporate donations or to go below a figure of &euro;100, if I understood correctly when he explained it on an earlier Stage.  I agree that it is most difficult for Independents.  The public and the media should examine this issue.  There should be a fully transparent system and a certain amount should go for each vote collected.  Some allowance should be made to all parties and then we would have a level playing field based on votes garnered at an election.  That would cut out the need for funding altogether.  Naturally that would not suit the larger parties.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has been fund-raising wholesale since and before it came into government.  The Minister was leading the charge with all the various events including horse racing events and the tents.  Fine Gael attacked the last Government for the Galway races tent but those in the party have a fair number of tents themselves and a fair amount of money.  A good deal has been raised since Fine Gael came to government in spite of all the promises it made about transparency and so on.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is treating the Labour Party as the mudguard or the hind tit &mdash; pardon the expression &mdash; of this coalition.  The fund-raising is under way and the big business cabals are still here.  We have read in the newspapers of certain senior people in Fine Gael who got vast sums of money in soft loans on an interest only basis.  Other Fine Gael Deputies bought properties off them and this sticks in the craw of the electorate.  The old big Blueshirt regime is still going on.</P>
        <P>This is the same way the Minister treated people with the septic tank charge.  The ideas was to charge the little people, stand on them and then kick them out of the way because those in Fine Gael were the big people or the landed gentry as they used to be called.  That will not wash with the public and certainly it does not wash with me on behalf of the public in my constituency.  Deputy Healy-Rae pointed out that the so-called independent gerrymandering of the constituencies is an effort to get rid of Independents.  What is taking place in my county is outrageous.  Two county councils which have been in place for almost two centuries are being abandoned and then forced together.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete lines 16 to 40, to delete page 8, and in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 33 and to substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">7.&mdash;The Act of 1997 is amended by inserting the following section after section 23A (inserted by section 49(<i>d</i>) of the Act of 2001):</P>
        <P LI="4">&ldquo;23AA.&mdash;(1) None of the following persons namely&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="5">(<i>a</i>) a provider of a programme of education and training,</P>

        <P LI="4">makes a payment to a club, society or other body, operating with the permission and on the premises of the provider of a programme of education and training, and every member of which is a student who is enrolled or registered with the provider of a programme of education and training.</P>
        <P LI="4">(3) Where, notwithstanding subsection (1) a donation the acceptance of which is prohibited by that subsection, is made to a person referred to therein, the donee shall, not later than 14 days after the receipt of the donation either, return the donation or, in the case of a donation which is a monetary donation, the part of it exceeding the limit concerned to the corporate donor and keep a written record of that return for the purposes of it being furnished to the Standards in Public Office Commission, if required by it.</P>
        <P LI="4">(4) The Standards in Public Office Commission shall dispose of all moneys, property or goods received under subsection (3) in such manner as may be directed by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Sinn F&eacute;in opposes the practice of corporate donations to political parties.  Our amendments state clearly that there should be a total ban on corporate donations, whether large or small and whether paid directly or through any intermediary, but an exemption from the new registration requirements is given to a provider of a programme of education and training or a students&rsquo; union where such a body makes a payment to a students&rsquo; society or club.  This will allow colleges or students&rsquo; unions to continue to provide financial support to student groups that promote political participation without being obliged to comply with the new corporate donor requirements.  These grants to student societies can hardly be regarded as the sort of corporate donation that needs to be restricted, and this exemption does not contradict our objective of enhancing the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.  There is a world of difference between a student society getting a payment from a third level institution to fund a political society and what we are talking about here in terms of corporate donations.  Students&rsquo; unions should not be subject to this.</P>

	<P>The amendments from Deputy Stanley and Sinn F&eacute;in would effectively delete most of the provisions dealing with corporate donations from the Bill.  On Second Stage I outlined the legal reasons an outright ban on corporate donations raises questions with reference to Article 40 of the Constitution on freedom of expression and freedom of association.  The amendments put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in do not have sufficient regard to the compatibility of an outright ban on corporate donations with these constitutional commitments.  My legal advice from the Attorney General is that, notwithstanding that the Government would have nothing against these particular matters in principle, it cannot be done in practice because of the constitutional issues.  However, these issues can be referred in the future to the constitutional convention for consideration.</P>
        <P>The matter of exemptions for students is already dealt with through amendments that I introduced earlier, which reflect the spirit of ensuring that student societies in colleges continue to be able to engage in politics with the help of funding from the societies and from the third level colleges themselves.</P>

        <P LI="1">... indirect contributions are permitted if the recipient knows the name of and the address of the person on whose behalf the donation is made.  It is not, however, an offence to fail to inform the recipient of the person&rsquo;s true name and address.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments will require that where an indirect donation is given, the identity of the person on whose behalf the donation is made must also be provided to the recipient.</P>
        <P>It will be an offence to fail to provide this information and the intermediary making the indirect donation can be prosecuted.  The amendments will introduce a mechanism that will make it an offence not to provide the name of an indirect donor.  In doing so, it will have the effect of prohibiting anonymous indirect donations and will respond to the relevant Mahon tribunal recommendation.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 42 submitted by Deputy Brian Stanley on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in are being discussed with this group.  Each seeks to amend the same sections of the Bill as Government amendments Nos. 18 and 41, albeit for a different purpose.  We have dealt with five related amendments from Sinn F&eacute;in on the corporate donations provision included in the Bill and the purpose of these combined amendments, including the amendments being dealt with, is to ban corporate donations.  As I said, that is not constitutionally possible.  The Government has set out its approach to this matter which is legally sound.  Therefore, I oppose amendments Nos. 17 and 42.</P>

While the new requirements for the registration of corporate donors contained in the Bill will mean that detailed information will be available on such donors, I propose to apply additional requirements to all donations, corporate and non-corporate.  The tribunal has recommended that in distinguishing between contributions which are true political donations and those which it describes as bribes, additional details should be included in a donation declaration form to identify, first, whether the donation was solicited, second, the name of the person soliciting the donation and whether a receipt was given and, third, the date the donation was given and received.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 will apply these provisions to D&aacute;il, Seanad and European Parliament elections and election candidates, political parties and third parties.  Amendments Nos. 23 and 38 will apply the new requirements respectively at presidential elections and to local authority members.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Section 26(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Act of 1997 is amended by deleting the words &ldquo;Trade Union&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The point of this amendment is that for the purposes of making political donations, a trade union should not be considered as a corporation in the same way, for example, as a major bank, a major multinational corporation or a private company which will make donations to political parties from its profits.  A trade union is a different entity being made up of thousands and, in some cases, tens of thousands of ordinary members who might want to make contributions through their union towards a political purpose or a particular political party.  Subject to its democratic procedures, a trade union should be treated distinctly from a decision by a board of well heeled capitalists to make a donation which is largely for the purpose of affecting policy on behalf of a corporate minority, whereas trade unions, in general, represent ordinary working class people, workers who do not in any sense have the same clout or access to the political establishment as the major corporations through their lobbying and the various means by which they can influence policy, apart from the fact that many of the establishment political parties in the State are ideologically at one with the thinking of the big business elite.  In that regard, in fairness to workers and to allow for more alternative voices in opposition to, for example, the austerity policies of the Government and its predecessor, an exception should be made.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I was taken short on amendment No. 7 owing to some confusion.  I cannot go back to it, but I wonder why the Minister would not agree that Oireachtas Members should be able to donate to their own party up to the current limit, considering that the limits on donations from corporations, etc. were to ensure there would not be a danger of corruption.  However, that would not arise where an Oireachtas Member wanted to donate a larger amount to his or her party.  There are no implications in terms of there being a conflict of interest or anything like it.  I know we have passed amendment No. 7, but I would be interested to hear the Minister explain, perhaps in one sentence, the reason he would not agree to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment would delete the term &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; from section 26(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997.  This subsection clarifies that multiple donations given to the same person by a trade union must be aggregated in the annual report made by a trade union to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The amendment would not radically change the existing provisions in the current legislation or the Bill, but it would have a limited effect, especially given the new restrictions on donations, and introduce an inconsistency into the legislation.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to restrict the influence of corporate donations and corporate donors.  The definition of the term &ldquo;corporate donor&rdquo; embraces all classes and categories of bodies.  It is all-encompassing and encapsulates all incorporated and unincorporated bodies which include companies, trade unions, trusts, partnerships, societies, associations, clubs and non-governmental organisations.  Everybody is treated the same.  It is essential that all of these bodies are brought within the scope of the legislation and that they operate transparently when making political donations.  Trade unions are not being singled out positively or negatively in that regard.  They are being treated the same as everybody else.</P>

        <P FLI="0">One of the key aspects of the Bill relates to gender quotas.  That will be almost exclusively to ensure an adequate number of women are included in the political system.  It is an example of positive discrimination of which I am in favour.  It seems strange that the Bill would include gender-specific language such as the word &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo; in the context of the Bill.  I seek to change the language and to use the word &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo;.  It is particularly relevant given the content of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great sympathy with the amendments and I would love to accept them, but I had to get legal advice on whether the use of &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo; would be more appropriate than &ldquo;Chairman&rdquo;.  In the Constitution the Ceann Comhairle is referred to as the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The reference appears in a number of places, specifically in Articles 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 31, 33 and 35.  The term used in the Bill is correct from a legal point of view, although the Deputy does highlight a valid point.  For legal reasons I cannot accept the amendments but the spirit of what Deputy Murphy is trying to achieve will have to be considered in the review of the Constitution which is due to begin shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that what the Minister said is correct from a legal point of view but it serves to highlight just how discriminatory language is in terms of inclusiveness.  This is not the type of issue that gets priority in constitutional amendments but it could easily be dealt with in conjunction with other matters.  It would be an easy issue to explain to more than 50% of the population.  Having an in-built majority would be helpful.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;at the general election held subsequent to the polling day specified in the subparagraph (i)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to speak on behalf of Deputy Donnelly.  When we debated this issue on Committee Stage, the Deputy made a valid point about increasing the quota to 40%, and he provided statistics.  This amendment is to do with timing.  The provisions will become active after the next general election &mdash; in effect, ten years after the end of this term.  However, if we intend to change the culture we must act much more quickly.  There is a defect in the Bill in the sense that the length of time was not anticipated.  We had a good debate on Committee Stage, and I am sure Deputy Donnelly can more than adequately go through the detail.  If we are to change the culture and if quotas are to mean something then we cannot do so in a manner that could be open to criticism at a later point or that would allow an accusation of tokenism.  That is my take on the issue.  I am sure Deputy Donnelly will discuss the detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that I applaud what the Minister is doing with this Bill and its passage today is an historic event in Ireland.  No one desires quotas and I do not believe women coming in to politics seek them.  However, as Members are aware, the evidence from all over the world shows that in a political system such as that which obtains in Ireland at present, which has systemic discrimination against women entering politics at a cultural level and in previous times at a legislative level, the only way one can achieve a balance is through quotas.  In time, they can be taken away and I note some countries have used quotas to reach the balance and subsequently have removed them.  I told the Minister on Second and Committee Stages that I applaud this measure and consider the Bill to be historic legislation.</P>
        <P>The amendment concerns the time at which the quota moves from 30% to 40%.  On the assumption that this D&aacute;il will last for its expected duration, there will be a move to 30% within three and a half or four years.  I understand the Labour Party needs only to find three to five candidates to meet the quota, while Fine Gael must find approximately 13 candidates to so do.  The issue is that as currently written, the legislation provides that the 40% quota will come in at the election held seven years after the next election.  This means there will be an election in three and a half or four years, at which time the 30% quota will be introduced.  This is historic and is to be welcomed.  Thereafter, however, seven years must elapse before being able to go to the next level.  If one assumes full D&aacute;il terms, this will result in the 40% quota being introduced in 14 years&rsquo; time.  My concern is that having considered the 30% quota, the parties will decide to find the additional candidates needed to hit that quota, that is, three or four and 13 in the case of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, respectively, but that they will not need to worry about it again for another decade.  I believe such a timelag would kill the momentum required to achieve real cultural reform and proper representation of women within our democracy, which is the spirit of the Bill.  Members should recall that in respect of female representation worldwide, Ireland is currently ranked in 86th place and lies behind Afghanistan.  Sadly, if one considers the results from the last general election, we are moving backwards.  While the 30% quota is important, it will be just as important to have a strong signal from the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Government to the effect that Ireland is moving to 30% and then to 40%.  The message should not be that Ireland is moving to 30%, after which there will be a ten-year wait before going to 40%.</P>
        <P>It is possible, based on the Committee Stage debate, that the intention of the Bill was not necessarily to wait an additional ten years and to have the introduction of the 40% quota in 14 years&rsquo; time.  Consequently, the amendment as tabled provides for a move to a quota of 30% at the next election &mdash;  let us assume this will take place in three or four years &mdash; and then, at the subsequent election, to move to a quota of 40%.  I understand there could be a concern that in the event of an election being held in three and a half years&rsquo; time, another election could be held a year later and such momentum potentially would be too quick and might force the system to move in an unhealthy way.  Consequently, I suggest the Minister might consider accepting an oral amendment.  The first line on page 27 of the Bill provides for &ldquo;7 years&rdquo;.  In other words, we will wait seven years after the next election and in the election after that, the quota will move to 40%.  I asked the Minister to consider changing the aforementioned number from 7 to 3.  This would avoid the scenario in which there was a move to 30% in three and a half years&rsquo; time, followed within a year and a half by another election at which the quota rose to 40%.  In specifying three rather than seven years, Members would ensure the process does not move too fast but, critically, would also ensure a move to 30% in three or four years from now and thereafter a move to 40% in four or five years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>It is a fairly minor change but before I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I spent several years working both here and abroad on cultural change within large complex public organisations.  Based on that experience, I believe that achieving the type of cultural change Members seek and having proper representation of women within D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would be best served by maintaining the momentum wherein we move to 30% within three and a half years and then go to 40% in five years&rsquo; time.  I believe that is the spirit of what is intended.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting an oral amendment to change the period from seven years to three years.</P>

	<P>This amendment was debated on Committee Stage, when it was tabled by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Donnelly.  Deputy Donnelly used the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in respect of the amendment and all Members would agree with the spirit of the amendment.  It is somewhat ironic that Independent Members are discussing party quotas when they are not obliged to impose that measure on themselves, although members of political parties will be so obliged.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>However, having listened to his comments, Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan may be interested that when I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue in 2008, I was told I was being fanciful, this would not be achievable and this was a type of social engineering that it was not the job of this House to be doing.  However, Members are debating this measure this evening.  In approximately one hour&rsquo;s time, all Stages of deliberations on the Bill will have been completed and it will have been passed as legislation.  Moreover, it will be on its way to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in tomorrow afternoon to President Higgins.  This constitutes a milestone in electoral reform in Ireland.  It has put down a benchmark that has been long awaited and that previous Administrations have ignored.  At the next general election, political parties will be obliged to have a gender balance of 70% to 30% at a minimum.</P>
        <P>There is an assumption in the amendment tabled by Deputy Donnelly that political parties will simply hit the 30% quota and go no further.  However, it could well be the case that the 30% quota could be exceeded and that which Deputy Donnelly seeks could come about anyway because for the first time, political parties will be required to respond to gender measures.  However, I acknowledge there is an issue in that political parties may simply hit that 30% target.  This leaves open the possibility in future Administrations, at which time Deputy Donnelly himself could be in government, for the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government of the day after the next election to revert to this legislation and amend it.  However, the particular issue under discussion concerns the laying down of a benchmark and a milestone.  I note that when it has been introduced in other countries across Europe and elsewhere, it has been found that as soon as the process begins, the numbers start moving in the direction sought.  As far as this legislation is concerned, my hope for a future amendment is that a sunset clause will be inserted in respect of this provision because the position will have been reached at which membership of this House reflects the societal balance in respect of gender in Ireland.  In other words, I anticipate a time in the future at which it will not be necessary to legislate for such measures, as the desired outcome would arise naturally from the political process.  Ultimately, this is what this legislation is about.  It is not even about an issue of gender but is about a societal issue, in that as a society, Ireland must have a Parliament that reflects the balance of gender in the public.  Consequently, just as I did during the debate on this amendment on Committee Stage, I welcome the intent of Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s amendment.  However, we are moving on an incremental position.  I note that other reforming legislation in this House, such as the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, which also was an incremental measure, now brings Members onto other positions.  Ultimately, while I welcome what Deputy Donnelly is proposing, what is being done today is the correct measure.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports gender quotas and we agree with that aspect of the Bill and what it is doing for politics and gender.  However, it should be decoupled from corporate donations and it is a bit disingenuous of the Government parties to put both together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there is any irony in a Member of the House advocating for the representation of women in politics, whether the Member is in a party or not.  There is nothing ironic about me standing up here at all.  In terms of political form in this country, it is the single most important thing we need to do, although I think there is a lot we need to do.  I believe passionately in it and I will continue to support the Minister on it, but there is certainly no irony in me advocating for it.</P>
        <P>I have a concern about the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the parties may exceed the quota themselves.  Perhaps they will.  I hope they will, but let us look at what is going on in the culture.  We are moving backwards.  Were we on a path that had already 20%, 25%, 30% and looking at 35%, then I would say that they may exceed it, but we are not on that path.  We are going backwards.  One of the things that has really surprised me in my time as a Deputy is some of the hostility towards greater female participation.  When we were discussing this one day, a TD told me that a woman&rsquo;s place is in the home and that politics is a man&rsquo;s business.  This was not a member of the old guard in politics for the last 30 years.  I have heard some horrific comments on the culture.  I accept that this is not necessarily the norm, but it is there and it is strong.  Let us look at the future politicians from Young Fine Gael and &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il as examples, because we know how they voted.  They voted against quotas.  If we look at the culture and where the system is going, then we must conclude that the system, sadly, is going in the opposite direction to that which the Minister and I hoped it would go. That is why we need an enforcing mechanism.  It would be great if we did not need quotas.  My concern is with where the system is going.</P>
        <P>This is historic legislation and I congratulate the Minister and the Government on it.  This amendment was not tabled on Committee Stage but it arose during debates at that Stage.  It comes down to a simple issue.  Do we want to wait 14 years to move to 40%?  The legislation states that the threshold shall be 40%, so we are going to 40%.  This amendment is all about momentum and it is about a very clear signal to the system which states that we are moving to 30% and five years later we are moving to 40%, as opposed to moving to 30% and 14 years later moving to 40%.  That is all it is.  We agree absolutely on where the system needs to go.  As somebody who has spent time looking at how to change cultures, I believe strongly that waiting 14 years to go to 40% is just too long.  We could wait nine years.  That would be a small but very important change in shifting and building the momentum.  That is what this is about.  I ask that it be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand clearly where Deputies Donnelly and Murphy are coming from.  The gender balance provisions we are putting in the Bill are ambitious.  It refers to the participation of women in politics in particular, but we must be conscious of the fact that 15.19% of candidates elected in the last general election were women.  It is a fair challenge to get to 30% between now and the next election, unless there is a cultural change in the political system.  The 30% requirement will double the amount of female participation in the next general election. It is a matter for the electorate then to decide whether they want to elect those people, whether they are male or female.</P>
        <P>We studied the recent French elections.  A parity law was introduced in France in 2000 and it provided for a gender balance in candidate selection at general elections.  It linked candidate selection to the funding of political parties, in a similar way to what we are doing here.  By 2007, the number of women elected to the French National Assembly stood at just 18.5%, but on 17 June 2012, the number of women elected increased to 26.8%.  It has taken a bit of time since 2000 to increase the number of women elected to the French National Assembly by 50%.  There are now 155 women in the French National Assembly.  It took a period of time for people to gear up to the notion that we should make a bigger political and cultural effort to bring about a greater gender balance in the make-up of our parliamentary system.</P>
        <P>I understand the bona fides of Deputy Donnelly and what he is trying to achieve.  Let us see how we can bed in the 30% quota for the next election.  There is nothing stopping any future Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government amending that legislation after that election, so that the momentum to which the Deputy refers can be maintained.  I will be glad to keep an eye on this.  I am sure all Members who spoke on the issue are not divided on the principle of it, but perhaps we are taking a more pragmatic approach in the political system to ensuring we do not fall flat on our faces when achieving the objective of increasing the participation of women in politics.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite a number of the amendments that I tabled were ruled out of order.  I tried to take one of them directly from an amendment in the Seanad which dealt with vouching moneys.  I believe that all public moneys should be properly accounted for and vouched, and I am very disappointed that this has been ruled out of order.  I tabled two amendments on the issue and I am disappointed that I did not get to debate them.  I thought the amendment which had been tabled in the Seanad, which I changed marginally, would have been accepted as it was accepted in the Seanad.  We have to deal with that issue.  It is very disappointing that it takes so long to deal with things that are so obviously necessary and the right things to do.</P>
        <P>The key issue in the Bill is that of gender quotas and it is really important that this happens.  It clearly does not apply to Independents because it is linked to a sanction in the funding system and that particular stream of funding does not apply to Independents.  That funding comes under the Electoral Acts, which goes back to the original amendment that I spoke about earlier.  The real movement towards a parliament that reflects the citizens should begin at local government level.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that the same set of circumstances apply and a sanction is not available to be included in the Bill.  It will, however, be essential.  If one wants to see a greater number of women in the political system, it will happen at local government level in the first instance.  For example, in Kildare, when I stood for election in 2009, there were 43 candidates for county council elections, of whom six were women.  There were three electoral areas where there was no choice on the ballot paper.  We have to see an end to this type of offering.</P>
        <P>There are several provisions missing from this Bill.  One hopes we will see more comprehensive legislation to deal with electoral funding in the broader sense.  The Standards in Public Office Commission constantly complains every year about the amount of funding that appears to be available, even in election years, that does not find its way through the process of declaration.  That impacts very negatively on the political system.</P>
        <P>Obviously, Parliament moves slowly and there are other legislative priorities, some of them dictated by outside bodies.  Restoring faith in the political system will only happen if political parties and politicians are affected negatively as a consequence of legislation such as this.  There are several other elements that should have been contained in this Bill.  I will probably end up introducing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to address the provisions that were rejected.  My amendments that were ruled out of order are long enough to warrant doing that.</P>
        <P>I thank the officials involved in putting together this important legislation which I hope will make a difference.  The debate on Committee Stage was useful but I believe there is a long way to go before we have a political system that is funded in a way that will be accepted by the citizens.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Technical Group, I extend my thanks to the Ceann Comhairle and his entire team for all of his and their work in serving the D&aacute;il this term.  I understand we forgot to say that earlier on today.</P>
        <P>It is self-evident that the same arguments for female representation at national level should apply at local government level.  From the debate on this Bill, it is my understanding that the Government would like to see its provisions regarding female representation apply at local level.  When I put it to the Minister before as to the possibility of bringing in quotas at local government level, he informed me it was not legislatively possible to tie political funding to local government elections.  The Government would pursue the same quota provisions if it could find a forcing mechanism and some sort of sanction that could be applied against political parties at local level.  Over recent days I contacted several civil society groups which are working to further female representation in political life.  They told me they had an undertaking that this was being examined in other legislation and the Government is considering it.  This was not brought up on Second or Committee Stages.  Will the Minister confirm whether a quota mechanism for local government is being investigated?</P>
        <P>I will be voting for this Bill.  Once again, I congratulate the Minister and his officials on a truly historic Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I also commend and congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on this extensive legislation.  Most of the focus has been on the particular section dealing with gender parity.  I imagine this legislation will pass without challenge when it is put to the vote.  It reminds me of the evening when the civil partnership legislation was passed in the previous D&aacute;il.  There was a feeling right across the House then that a good day&rsquo;s work had been done.  A good day&rsquo;s work has also been done today on reforming the political system with regard to female participation.  It is a matter for which all Members can claim a degree of ownership.  I commend the Minister and his officials on taking this legislation through the various Stages and ensuring it will be law for the next general election.</P>
        <P>Members of the 5050 Group, who would exceed Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s ambitions with regards to female representation, are present in the Visitors Gallery.  I commend and congratulate them on their own campaign.  Obviously, when this Bill is passed, they will be back to us asking when we will get to 50:50 male-female ratio in political participation.  It would be regrettable not to recognise the role played by the 5050 Group in addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>We have begun the process of instilling a new type of dynamic and process in politics that I hope we will see at the next general election.  I take Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s point on board that we should not be scraping over the 30% line just to be compliant with the legislation but instead getting political representation to resemble society&rsquo;s gender balance.</P>

The legislation&rsquo;s provisions were part of the programme for Government.  I am delighted we were able to amend it today to take account of recommendations made by the Mahon tribunal so as to make political funding much more transparent and accountable, reduce the dependence on corporate donations and introduce a system in which people of both genders can participate in politics in a more open way.</P>

	<P>In common with my Government and party colleagues, I have strongly welcomed the publication of the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s final report.  I wish to take this opportunity to outline the role my Department played in respect of the overall response paper being published today.</P>
        <P>The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s final report and its findings of endemic corruption of Irish political life call for a comprehensive and forceful response.  This can be achieved through reform of the various systems for prevention of corruption in the Irish political system in the first instance.  It can also be achieved by overhauling this country&rsquo;s administrative, regulatory, law enforcement and judicial systems.  I am, therefore, committed to the delivery of the ambitious commitments relating to political reform which are outlined in the programme for Government.  The unifying theme running through these initiatives relates to securing greater openness and transparency and enhanced accountability and thereby ensuring more effective public governance.  As I have previously highlighted, these represent a comprehensive suite of significant measures that have the potential to bring about an important shift in the rules of the game for the political and administrative systems in this country.</P>
        <P>My Department has responsibility for the implementation of a significant number of the recommendations contained in the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s final report.  These recommendations fall into the categories of conflicts of interest, lobbying, corruption and misuse of confidential information.</P>
        <P>Policy proposals on lobbying regulation were published earlier this month and have been the subject of a recent successful public seminar involving key interests and experts.  Lobbying is a positive force in our democracy.  However, a comprehensive approach to the regulation of lobbying is required in order to shed greater light on the question of who engages in lobbying and for what purpose.  We need to know more about how public policy and decision-making processes are shaped.  Taking account of the issues raised in the consultation process, my Department is currently developing draft heads of a Bill in this area.  When Government approval is obtained in respect of these, I intend to submit them to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for its consideration.  I aim to have this legislation enacted early next year.</P>
        <P>The introduction of comprehensive whistleblower protection legislation is central to more effective management and early amelioration of risk, in both the public and private sectors.  As Deputies will be aware, in well-run and risk-focused organisations, whistleblowing should be encouraged and promoted.  The need for protection against reprisals is a safety net when the whistleblower, rather than the information he or she discloses, becomes the primary focus of the organisation&rsquo;s attention.  Following their approval by the Government and with a view to informing the public debate on the matter I published the draft heads of the protected disclosures in the public interest Bill earlier this year.  I have received, and am considering, a number of submissions from interested parties, including Transparency International, ICTU, IBEC, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and others.  All have made submissions and offered observations and I anticipate that I will be in a position to introduce the Bill to the D&aacute;il in the autumn session.</P>
        <P>Beyond the registration of lobbyists and the introduction of whistleblower legislation, a large number of recommendations in the final report of the Mahon tribunal relate to conflicts of interest.  The latter are characterised by the tribunal as the &ldquo;root cause of corruption&rdquo;.  Collectively, these recommendations point to the need for a fundamental review and extensive overhaul of the legislative framework relating to ethics.  There is a consensus that the existing framework requires significant reform and modernisation.  There are some very important policy issues to be grappled with in advancing this project but the basic objective must be to put in place a model that can play an appropriate role in embedding ethics as an integral part of the values, culture and behaviour of the Irish public service.</P>
        <P>Given the watershed that is the Mahon tribunal report, I have decided to take this opportunity to engage in a full review of how the existing legislative framework for ethics can be reformed in order to develop a single, comprehensive and overarching framework that will be grounded on a clear and comprehensive set of principles.  This considerable undertaking will cross all Departments and sectors and will compliment the work of my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Equality and the Environment, Community and Local Government, who will both be contributing to this debate.  My Department will continue to work closely with officials from both Ministers&rsquo; Departments.  I remain committed to continuing to drive forward the Government&rsquo;s reform programme on behalf of, and in conjunction with, all of my colleagues in government, with a view to ensuring that ethical values are and will be seen to be fully addressed and reinforced in Irish public life.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s response to the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s final report, which is being published today.  Engaging in a debate on this topic is important because, at its core, is the issue of trust.  Trust is essential to any democracy.  It is what is vested in each public representative at the point of election and it is what is expected of them throughout their service to their electorate.  When members of the public cast their vote for any one of us, what they are effectively saying is: &ldquo;We trust you&rdquo;; &ldquo;We trust you to champion and support our interests&rdquo;; and &ldquo;We trust you to be straight, honest and honourable&rdquo;.  They must have confidence and certainty that we will, at all times, represent their needs, not ours.</P>
        <P>The people will always give out about politicians &mdash; that comes with the territory &mdash; but when they believe that politicians abuse the honour of representing them in order to feather their own nests, that goes far beyond mere criticism to a complete loss of trust in those elected and a loss of faith in the entire political system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mahon tribunal report shows that this is exactly what happens when vested interests and self-serving influencing and decision-making undermine and corrupt the system.  The trust vested in all politicians at both national or local levels was betrayed by some politicians.  As a result of both the corrupt acts of a few individuals and the extensive evidence uncovered and published in the Mahon report, the credibility of our political system has been severely undermined and shaken.  That betrayal has been condemned, and rightly so, on all sides of the House.  The response to it can probably be summed up in two words, namely, never again.</P>
        <P>This is an issue that is too important to be reduced to party politics.  It is issue of patriotism, pride and trust.  It is also an issue that goes to the heart of our democracy and our responsibility to the people of this nation.  That puts an onus on all of us in this House and across all levels of elected government to reassure the people that the next scandal will not be allowed to happen.  With the publication of the tribunal&rsquo;s findings and multi-stranded recommendations, we have &mdash; at one and the same time &mdash; an urgent duty and an opportunity to rebuild public confidence in the system.  That means acting swiftly and decisively to ensure a fully accountable and transparent planning system in which there will be no scope for corrupt practices to subvert the checks and balances which are either already in place or in the process of being put in place.</P>
        <P>The whole-of-Government response published today summarises actions on each of the 64 recommendations of the Mahon tribunal and reveals that 29 recommendations have already been or are in the process of being implemented, either partly or in full; 14 recommendations will be implemented by means of additional initiatives; and 18 recommendations remain under consideration and will be considered as policy and legislative changes are progressed in these areas during the remainder of the year.  Of the 64 recommendations, only three are not proposed to be implemented.  It is clear from today&rsquo;s response paper that many of the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations are already being actioned through ongoing legislative reforms and commitments in the programme for Government.  I include in this regard the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 in respect of which the House has just completed its deliberations.  From my policy perspective, I have expedited the introduction of political donation reforms through the latter legislation.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Government&rsquo;s response earlier today is an important step but it is only the beginning.  I am of the view that our concerted actions across a range of areas and cutting across a number of Government Departments and agencies demonstrate that we are serious and committed to strengthening transparency and accountability in our planning, ethics and governance codes.  Having learned from this experience and taken due account of previous systemic failures, it is now our collective duty as Ministers, public representatives and as responsible citizens to ensure that these occurrences remain a harsh, costly and painful reminder and a spur to set things right and to put in place the safeguards to ensure that such corruption never happens again.  We must set down standards and introduce robust regulations not just to prevent future wrongdoing but also to prove to the citizens of this nation that its future will be shaped honestly and honourably; demonstrate that we take the public&rsquo;s trust and our responsibilities very seriously and illustrate that we will strive to restore the trust that has been lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mahon tribunal report exposed the insidious and corrupt behaviour of some in Irish public life, behaviour that has done inestimable damage to our economy, our environment, our international reputation and, perhaps most of all, to the trust of Irish people in officeholders and public officials.  The tribunal made a series  of recommendations for changes in the law on corruption and its prevention.  I am glad to report to the House that I have already taken concrete steps in this regard not only to implement the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations but to go beyond those recommendations in providing for anti-corruption legislation with innovative preventative and punitive measures.  The particular measures I propose are outlined in the general scheme of the criminal justice (corruption) Bill, which I published on 20 June.</P>
        <P>The tribunal also made recommendations concerning the application of enhanced customer due diligence measures to domestic politically exposed persons in the context of anti-money laundering controls.  I propose to go further than the tribunal recommended and to apply such controls to members and senior managers of local authorities.  The necessary changes to the general scheme of the criminal justice (money laundering and terrorist financing) (amendment) Bill will be brought to Government in the autumn.</P>
        <P>A number of the recommendations of the tribunal relate to asset confiscation and forfeiture.  As indicated in the tribunal report, the current provisions regulating the confiscation of proceeds of crime as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005 are already relatively robust.  While existing measures under proceeds of crime legislation allow for the targeting of benefits derived from corrupt conduct, the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations seek to further improve the overall effectiveness of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act.  The recommendations of the tribunal on asset confiscation will form part of a broader review that has already been undertaken with regard to both the proceeds of crime legislation and the Criminal Justice Act.</P>
        <P>The Mahon tribunal report also made two recommendations on improving the conduct of future tribunals.  The recommendations are already reflected in the text of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.  I have arranged for its restoration to the D&aacute;il Order Paper and the Bill will be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>The commitments given to progress work on the recommendations of the tribunal and the progress already been made on a significant number of the recommendations reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to change any perception that corrupt behaviour can ever again, in any shape or form, be tolerated in public office or that a blind eye might again be cast on such behaviour.  No such behaviour should be tolerated in any circumstance.</P>
        <P>We continue to deal with the legacy of past corrupt behaviour.  Our criminal justice system will continue to play its part.  While evidence given before the tribunal cannot be used itself as a basis for criminal prosecution, the evidence catalogues the behaviour of those involved and it will assist our law enforcement agencies in pursuing any appropriate matters.  I assure the House that where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has evidence of wrongdoing it will be fully pursued.</P>
        <P>Finally, I can confirm to the House that the steps I have outlined, demonstrate my firm commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring there is a robust, comprehensive and effective legislative framework and architecture underpinning the State&rsquo;s response to corruption in public office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mahon tribunal was discussed at length in this House and all political parties gave responses to it in a comprehensive manner.  The fact that some recommendations are being rolled out is timely.  I would have liked if the response paper referred to by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, had been circulated to us in advance.  I understand he had to leave to speak in the Seanad.  The fact that a comprehensive suite of measures is being put in place is most welcome across Irish society.  The detail of what unfolded from the Mahon tribunal disgusted the public and led to a complete undermining and erosion of the trust people had in politics and in some public representatives.  A small number of public representatives brought the whole body of public representatives into disrepute.  That is regrettable.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations advanced is legislation to implement a register of lobbyists.  My party published a proposal on that a number of months ago and made a comprehensive submission to the public consultation process undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recently, we partook in a public consultation seminar in Farmleigh, which was quite informative.  That proved quite useful because it threw up difficult anomalies that must be squared before we can bring about an effective and transparent registration of lobbyists.  For example, some legal houses are engaging in lobbying.  There are concerns from some people in the legitimate lobbying industry that legal privilege will allow law firms to engage in lobbying without having to register.  Some of the interesting discussions centred on cooling off periods, which referred to people exiting politics and going into private enterprise and engaging in lobbying.  There is a debate about how long the cooling off period should be.  I posed the reverse scenario where people who had been engaged in the art of lobbying entered the world of politics and find themselves quite close to decision-makers, whether working as special advisers or as officeholders.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, we are lobbied every day.  The vast majority is in the public interest and for the right reasons.  There is not something necessarily wrong with it.  There is a perception that it is part of the dark arts.  Some people who are not well known and who are not household names have ease of access to the corridors of power and to decision-makers.  That must be equalised and the system must be put on a level playing pitch so that everyone knows who people are talking to about public policy.  Lobbyists who are former public representatives or personalities are household names.  However, many lobbyists are former high-ranking civil and public servants and people who worked at the top levels in the back offices of political parties.  They are not household names yet they have access.  That must be equalised and it will make for fairer legislation in the long run.</P>
        <P>Much has been made of conflicts of interest.  There is a problem where there is a conflict of interest or where there is a perception of a conflict of interest.  We await with interest how the Government response paper will deal with conflicts of interest.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government mentioned trust and the planning system.  I agree with him on that point but we must remember that planning issues, irregularities and allegations of corruption and irregularities do not stop at the Red Cow roundabout.  We discussed this in the House and outside it.  There was disagreement in this Chamber on what should be done regarding the seven named local authorities in respect of which the former Minister, John Gormley, intended to establish investigations.  If the Government is serious about implementing the recommendations in the Mahon tribunal report, there must be a broader and deeper examination of the allegations relating to those authorities.  In the time since that debate took place we have heard about the situation in Waterford in respect of which my party called for an inquiry.  We had the trial of Mr. Forsey and his conviction on a charge of corruption.  It is beyond comprehension that members of Waterford County Council would proceed to make a decision on land zoning in the midst of a Garda investigation.  That is a matter of great concern to the public.</P>
        <P>Also of great concern is the situation in Wicklow.  As I understand it, the elected public representatives from Wicklow County Council who sought a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, were told by him that they would have to deal with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  If the Government is serious about cleaning up irregularities across local government &mdash; which the Minister is charged with doing &mdash; then there must be access to Government for local government representatives.  It is not good enough that elected members of Wicklow County Council are being denied access to the persons in Government with special responsibility for planning matters throughout the State.  There are several issues under contention in Wicklow, one of which reached a settlement in the High Court that will potentially expose the State for up to &euro;60 million.  I understand several investigation files have gone missing, including one referred to as the Ballybeg file.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for the Government to set out a plan of action on foot of the recommendations in the Mahon tribunal report while choosing to ignore all of the other zoning cases throughout the country which are similar and relevant but not mentioned specifically in the report.  The refusal by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to meet with elected public representatives from her own party is beyond belief.  I am told that a complaint in this regard will be lodged in due course with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.</P>

	<P>It is not good enough to have statements on the Mahon tribunal report while ignoring the issues of grave concern that have emerged in recent weeks and months.  In the case of the Waterford situation, the majority of councillors involved are from the Minister&rsquo;s party.  Some are from my own party and we have no issue with that.  We are happy to have the matter publicly investigated.  The Minister, however, rubbished our call for a planning inquiry on the basis that there is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence for such.</P>

	<P>What about all of those who were involved in the zoning decision?  The Minister is burying his head in the sand on these matters.  We have had three Ministers discussing this matter in the House today.  Unfortunately for the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, he is the one left carrying the can.  He is banging the drum on behalf of his colleagues.</P>

	<P>There is a certain irony in watching Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael fighting it out to see which can stand tallest on the mountain of morality and claim to be the least corrupt in Irish politics.  It is amusing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should avoid mentioning morality and Sinn F&eacute;in in the same sentence.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should allow Deputy O&rsquo;Brien to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Niall Collins that dealing with the recommendations in the Mahon tribunal report does not absolve anybody of everything that happened up to that point.  We certainly must, in the public interest, investigate all of the issues the Deputy has raised.  My party will support any such investigation.</P>
        <P>However, we are here today to discuss the recommendations set out in the report of the Mahon tribunal.  We already spent several days after the publication of the report discussing its findings.  There was some political point-scoring in that debate, which is inevitable when members of different parties are discussing such an important report.  However, there was also a sense among Members of all parties and none that we had reached a crossroads in Irish politics.  The general consensus was that the choice before us was either to take the Mahon tribunal report and, as was done with previous tribunal reports, put it on a shelf without implementing any of its recommendations, or we could look seriously at those recommendations with a view to implementing as many as possible.</P>
        <P>If the Minister wants to have a conversation with Deputy Niall Collins, he should leave the Chamber.  I will be more than happy to chat with the Acting Chairman and Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett in his absence.  Is he interested in what we have to say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am listening.</P>

	<P>He seems to be multitasking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened carefully to what the Deputy said.  Unfortunately, he has not made much sense yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not very fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What my colleagues and I have to say makes a great deal more sense than much of what we hear from the Minister.</P>
        <P>We have had statements from three Ministers today outlining the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations in the Mahon tribunal report.  We certainly welcome some of the initiatives which have been undertaken.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, spoke about the register of lobbyists legislation, which will go to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We spoke about the whistleblower legislation, the money laundering legislation and ethics in public life and what the Government proposes to do to improve the legislation.  It is important that we do so, not only because it is badly needed but because politics has been damaged by what has been found by the Mahon tribunal.  It is incumbent on all of us &mdash; those who are members of any political party and those who are not attached to a party &mdash; to ensure we never allow circumstances to exist in which people get involved in politics for the wrong reasons, not in the interest of the public good but because of self-interest and financial gain.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that three of the 64 recommendations would not be acted on.  He did not say why that is the case and I would be interested in having a discussion on that at a later date.  The Minister referred earlier to the electoral Bill and the inclusion of a number of recommendations in that legislation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has already done some work on the whistleblower legislation and there is further work to be done by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  The whole process of the publication of the heads of important legislation is constructive and allows us to obtain a wider opinion on Bills; it allows committees &mdash; be it the justice or finance committee &mdash; to invite interested parties to outline their opinions, which makes for better legislation.</P>
        <P>In spite of our political differences with the Government parties, Sinn F&eacute;in will not be found wanting in its support for any legislation that cleans up politics and ensures that the type of behaviour uncovered in the Mahon tribunal never recurs.  We are honoured to represent our constituents and I feel privileged to be in this Chamber and to have the ability to effect change.  I find it difficult to believe that some people abuse that power.  It has happened and it will happen again unless we put in place the necessary ethics and other legislation to ensure proper standards in public office.  If we do not put that on the Statute Book, we too will be guilty of allowing such practices to occur in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I found it interesting that the Government chose to have this debate on its response to the Mahon tribunal at the last moment.  I can only assume it is part of a fairly concerted strategy over the past couple of weeks to try to end this session of the D&aacute;il on a positive note and give the public the sense that things are moving in the right direction, that the Government is delivering and doing well and that we are on the road towards a better future.  Of course, we all hope that is the case, and that this is not just a communications and spin strategy and maybe an emergency response to the disastrous situation that faced the Government in terms of the massive opposition to the unjust household charge.</P>
        <P>While there is a lot of self-congratulation about the response to the Mahon tribunal and the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, which has just been passed, it is important not to be too triumphalist about all of this because the backdrop is an unprecedented period of corruption which culminated in the greatest economic crisis we have seen since the foundation of the State &mdash; a crisis which has left the majority of people in a very bad situation.  More people are living in poverty than ever before in recent times, more people are homeless, more people are on housing lists, more people are unemployed and huge numbers are emigrating.  That is the legacy of the period of corruption.</P>
        <P>I heard some Deputies, in particular from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, refer to the corruption as something that existed among some Deputies.  It is important to underline that this is not what Judge Mahon said.  He said there was endemic corruption in Irish political life.  That means it was rampant across Irish political life.  It is worth saying, not as a point-scoring effort but as a simple statement of fact, that the two parties which dominated Irish political life and which Mahon described as endemically corrupt were Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  If Irish political life was endemically corrupt during the period leading to this disaster, then obviously that endemic corruption emanated primarily from those two parties, so a little bit of humility about that legacy and the consequences of the period of endemic corruption would be quite useful.</P>
        <P>It is far too early to say whether this is a serious effort to clean up Irish politics and whether the measures contained in the Bill are more than just window dressing which has been forced on the Irish political establishment as a result of the disastrous crisis that now besets Irish society and the anger of the people at that rampant corruption.  I do not think the signs are very good or that we have much to be proud of given that we spent &euro;0.5 billion on a whole succession of tribunals and virtually nobody who was prominent in that period of endemic corruption has been put in jail or has had real justice served on him or her.  In fact, most of the key players in both parties have walked away from political life with massive pensions, having presided over or been involved in that level of corruption.  They are wealthy people and remain prominent in the higher echelons of Irish society.  If Fine Gael was serious about leading by example, it would tell us who were the corporate and other wealthy donors who helped it amass a &euro;3 million war chest prior to the last election so that we would know which individuals and corporate interests were influencing the political decisions which have, for example, left NAMA developers still being paid &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 to preside over NAMA assets and other such activities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, have left the Chamber.  I respect the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, but I&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have responsibility for planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept that and we spoke about that earlier.  I am glad the Minister of State is here but they are the heavy hitters we are told about all the time.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Much was expected of the Mahon tribunal.  However, it sat for an eternity, made millionaires out of many barristers and produced a huge final report that would take weeks to read.  With the exception of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who is doing a decent job, the Ministers with responsibility for this matter are not making any real efforts to respond to the report.  I do not trust the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Justice and Equality, Deputies Hogan and Shatter, respectively.  They live on a different planet from us mere mortals and are not interested in dealing with ordinary people.  The cosy cartels continue to exist in the courts, politics and some levels of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What goes on every day in the Commercial and High Courts is sickening and outrageous.  Members of the Judiciary &mdash; I will not refer to anyone by name in case the Acting Chairman is worried &mdash; may select cases.  I receive a constant flow of people in my office who cannot secure justice or people to represent.  Even solicitors are being bullied and threatened.</P>
        <P>Not one banker, regulator or senior politician has been arraigned for what took place when this country was plundered, raped and brought to its knees.  Ordinary citizens are being pilloried and criminalised for minor crimes for which I accept they should be punished.  The rich and powerful get away with it, however.  Fine Gael has tents, caravans and God knows what else for raising funds.  Having promised to get rid of this type of fund raising, it has failed to do so.  What we have instead is the Minister, &ldquo;Big Phil the Enforcer&rdquo;, bulldozing through a household charge, which I will pay, a septic tank charge, which is completely wrong and discriminates against rural dwellers, and many other matters.  He will not meet county councillors in Tipperary, not to speak of an independent and a Labour Party councillor in County Wicklow who are alleging corruption.  He states the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, must meet them.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, tells us that debtors will only have to sell wedding rings which are worth more than &euro;200,000.  On which planet does he live?  Where are these people who have wedding rings worth &euro;200,000?  How can the Ministers empathise, understand or send out a signal that they are interested in having transparent, open and honest Government?  The corruption and big cartels continue and the Ministers will not engage or listen.  As I stated this morning, the blueshirts are still in business and they want to make mere mortals lie down.  They will not get away with it because it behoves all of us to stand up for ordinary people who have been wronged and treated as blackguards.  It is the taxpayers who pay for the tribunals and must provide &euro;50 million to meet the costs of a High Court case brought against Wicklow County Council.  One cannot simply sign cheques for this, that and the other; full accountability and transparency are required.  We were promised the bondholders would be burned and hellfire would not be hot enough for them, yet we are still on the same merry-go-round, with the same senior officials still in place and exercising their permanent grip on government.</P>
        <P>While some decent members of the Government parties want to do their best, they are being thwarted by fellows who know how to talk to Michael Fingleton, how to get a soft, interest-only loan of &euro;800,000 or &euro;900,000 and how to get money at race meetings.  They will condemn all those who challenge them or refuse to apologise for using unspeakable language to a lady in County Kerry.  These people are not fit for Government or power.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am referring to the statements made by three Ministers.  I look forward to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who has not yet spoken.  We had three condescending statements which referred to what took place under Fianna F&aacute;il Party Governments.  This Government has carried on the very same practices and does not have an interest or any notion of changing it.  They are not even trying to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that this debate is so short and has been scheduled for the tail end of this D&aacute;il session.  It is extremely important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  The Mahon report may have inquired into issues in Dublin but the same circumstances applied throughout the country.  When grounds emerged to investigate matters in a number of local authorities, the subsequent inquiries were conducted internally, which is wholly inappropriate and inadequate.</P>
        <P>A number of the issues raised in the Mahon report are being addressed by way of legislation.  One of the recommendations of the report was to establish a wholly accountable and democratically elected regional authority.  Proposals such as this must also be implemented.</P>
        <P>While I do not propose to equate inquiries into child abuse with planning inquiries, it is important to note that separate inquiries into clerical child sexual abuse found the same awful circumstances obtained in various locations.  Precisely the same applies in respect of the planning system.  The issues identified in the Mahon report did not stop at the Dublin boundaries.</P>
        <P>We must examine the reasons the planning system is so developer centred and works on behalf of developers rather than communities.  Unfinished ghost estates and mad decisions to zone flood plains and so forth are the product of this problem.  If we are to restore public confidence in the planning system, we must have a thorough debate followed by radical reform.  A short debate on the final afternoon of a long D&aacute;il session is not sufficient.  The Government must commit to providing time in the autumn to discuss this issue in a comprehensive manner and to introduce legislation governing the relationship between political funding and the political system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  To respond to Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s point, there is no reason we cannot return to this issue.  However, it was important to address it today before the House rises for the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Today marks an important departure in a planning scandal that has bedevilled politics since 1997.  In the intervening years, we have listened as a grotesque picture of corruption, avarice and greed emerged from Dublin Castle.  In particular when Frank Dunlop eventually came clean about the swag of cash he used to undermine the planning system and peddle influence, our worst fears about what had occurred in Dublin County Council were confirmed, if not exceeded.  The genuine rejection of that type of politics was given voice in this House when it held an extensive debate on the Mahon tribunal report some weeks ago.  I accept the bona fides of Deputies from all parties on that matter.</P>
        <P>Today is not the end of the Mahon tribunal saga but it represents a significant departure.  The challenge for the House is not only to express its disgust at what has been proved to have happened in the past &mdash; this has been done &mdash; but to fashion a comprehensive response that demonstrates that the political system has learned from the tribunal process and is determined to change how politics is done at local and national level.  The overriding goal must be to restore the trust of members of the public in their democratic institutions.  The Government gave a commitment to embark on this path after the publication of the Mahon tribunal report.  Today the whole of government response is laid out and I hope every citizen will take some time to consider the radical changes we are proposing through a course of action that addresses more than 60 of the Mahon report recommendations.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, outlined, reform in a significant number of areas is already under way.  In that regard, I note the passage, less than an hour ago, of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill and, in particular, the constructive manner in which all Deputies and Senators contributed to the debate on the legislation, as a result of which a better Bill will go to the President.</P>
        <P>Foremost in my mind are the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations on planning.  I am committed to introducing comprehensive reform of the planning system in response to the Mahon report.  There is a particular onus on me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for planning, to restore public trust in our planning system and this is a duty I intend to honour.  I have already introduced reform in the planning area.  The practice of developers promoting local area plans has been eliminated, for example, but I intend to introduce further reform.</P>
        <P>One of the most fundamental recommendations in the tribunal report relates to the establishment of a planning regulator and I am determined to see this recommendation implemented.  The establishment of a regulator brings with it serious issues of accountability and democratic control, which must be fully analysed if we are to get this important reform right.  Much deliberation has been carried out by my Department to find out how this might be implemented.  Important questions have to be addressed.  Will there be a role for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Ombudsman or a completely new independent office?  If the Minister is entirely removed from the process, how do we balance the democratic mandate of elected councillors against a powerful technocratic office?  What are the limits of the regulator&rsquo;s powers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the planning process and elected members?  Is the regulator&rsquo;s decision final?  If the office is to reside in an existing body such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, how will that affect the other functions of the board?  Is there an inherent tension between making decisions on forward planning, development plans and local area plans and making decisions on individual planning cases?  These are important questions about democracy, accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>I intend to introduce a comprehensive plan for an independent planning regulator.  It is important not only that we address this crucial issue but that we do it right.  With that in mind, I will consult the elected Members of the Oireachtas before I decide on a mechanism for delivering on this recommendation.  I will take account of the points raised by Opposition Deputies.  When the D&aacute;il reconvenes I intend to submit a paper to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht which will set out the various options and, with the agreement of the committee, I will attend a meeting to hear members&rsquo; views.  I believe that is an appropriate way to utilise the procedures of the D&aacute;il.  It is in marked contrast to the approach taken by Deputies Mattie McGrath and Niall Collins, who persisted in their usual tactic of innuendo and half-truth.</P>
        <P>I have initiated the process of appointing an independent planner with regard to the reviews to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  I hope to be in a position to make the appointment in the autumn, as I had indicated following the review carried out within the Department.</P>
        <P>Planning is essential for coherent, sustainable and healthy communities.  We are united in the view that what happened the past can never occur again, but our vision for planning must go beyond that.  By placing the values of community, sustainability and the common good at the heart of our planning system we can fashion a mechanism that delivers a thriving Ireland for the decades ahead.  That is my vision for planning and it is one that I intend to deliver.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been a number of cases in which personal financial details were leaked to the media by nationalised banking institutions within the control of the Minister for Finance.  It is disgraceful and outrageous that private and confidential banking details of individuals have been put in the public domain via our newspapers.  It is clear from reading these articles that they go beyond the basic security or mortgage information available to the public by means of a search of the Land Registry, the Registry of Deeds or the Companies Registration Office.  The articles refer to business and personal information that individual customers give to banks when looking for loans or refinancing.  This sensitive information does not appear on any public register and the only time it usually comes to light is during the course of litigation or other court proceedings, in which case, where business information is sensitive, aspects of hearings can be held in camera.</P>
        <P>This is a new and worrying development among nationalised banks.  It is not something that has happened, as far are I am aware, in private banks, other than by accidental or implicit divulgence of sensitive information.  It is an implied term of the contract between customers and banks that banks will keep their clients&rsquo; information confidential.  This confidentiality is not only confined to account transactions but extends to all banking information held on behalf of customers.  The bank&rsquo;s duty of confidentiality to its customers is fundamental to the relationship between the two parties.  A breach of this duty can give rise to legal actions but, unfortunately, significant damage can have been done by the time cases come to court.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because a number of business people in my constituency and, I am sure, those of many other Deputies have expressed concern about it.  I am referring to regular business people rather than big developers.  They are going through a tough time and are concerned about casual talk regarding their businesses and their relationships with their banks.  These rumours are undermining their efforts to put their businesses back on track.  Concerns have been expressed that details of settlement and refinancing arrangements which customers negotiate with banks could appear in local newspapers.  I ask the Minister for Finance to take a stand on this issue to ensure this new culture does not take over within our State-controlled banks.  This is a difficult time for many businesses.  Individuals provide sensitive business information in the course of their dealings with banks.  We should not allow the publication of this information in our newspapers to become a casual or acceptable practice.  There should be serious consequences for those who run the State banks if this practice is not brought under control.  If it happened in the private banks, someone would be sacked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Minister for Finance that he has not received any complaints about the leaking of personal banking information by nationalised banks to the media.  Without knowledge of the specific issue to which the Deputy referred I can only comment on this issue in the most general of terms.  Primary responsibility for the safeguarding of customer information rests with the financial institutions themselves.  As a shareholder the Government has no role in investigating data breaches in the State-owned financial institutions, although it obviously has an interest in ensuring that the State-owned banks follow best practice in order to protect their customers and the reputation of the institutions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Data Protection Commissioner is responsible for ensuring that people&rsquo;s rights are respected and those who hold personal information meet their responsibilities in this regard.  The Data Protection Acts make it clear that organisations that hold personal data on individuals owe them a duty of care.  This protection also extends to State-owned institutions.  In regard to data protection breaches, I understand that the policies in place between the banks and the Data Protection Commissioner are such that breaches are notified immediately to the commissioner upon discovery.  These breaches are then investigated internally and appropriate remedial actions are taken.  Outside of this process, any individual is entitled under the Data Protection Acts to make a written complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner, who will then deal directly with the relevant organisation.  The commissioner will make a full and thorough investigation of all the facts before making a decision.  If the complaint is found to be in breach of the electronic communications regulation the commissioner may decide to prosecute the organisation concerned.  The commissioner has significant powers to ensure that all organisations act in accordance with data protection laws.</P>
        <P>The data protection rules are very specific and are binding on every data controller.  A failure to observe these rules is a breach of the Act.  It is the responsibility of all institutions to ensure their data on individuals is safe and secure.  If any individual suffers damage to his or her reputation, financial loss or mental distress, the data controller of an organisation may be subject to civil sanctions and the individual may be entitled to claim compensation through the courts.  I strongly urge any individual who may suffer as a result of the leaking of personal banking information to explore these avenues of resolution.</P>
        <P>The protection of customers&rsquo; data is taken seriously by all of the State-owned financial institutions.  Each bank is fully aware of its obligations to safeguard the security of customer data and they employ a wide range of measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of that information.  All banks have strict security protocols for information technology and physical access in order to protect information.  They employ dedicated information security personnel, who commonly report to an information technology security council.  They also have an information security policy.  Bank network repositories and systems have robust password protection and access control, which restricts access to relevant personnel only.</P>
        <P>All bank premises are protected by swipe card access control systems and certain areas allow access to designated personnel only.  Banks generally also employ what is termed a clean desk policy, requiring all personnel to keep their desks clear of any sensitive or confidential data that should be stored securely.  Banks also have mandatory annual training courses for all personnel on the requirements of the Data Protection Acts and their responsibilities under them.  The courses also cover ethics and include the banks&rsquo; code of conduct.  I understand all personnel are required to review and electronically accept key policies, such as the code of conduct and information security policy.  These policies also inform personnel of the potential consequences of policy breaches.  As a shareholder, the Government will continue to work with the institutions to ensure that they take all necessary actions to safeguard the personal banking information of their customers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am familiar with the procedures and the possibility of complaints being made to the Data Protection Commissioner.  I am also aware of certain complaints that have been made to the Data Protection Commissioner.  Still, it should not be beyond the capability of the many officials that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has at his disposal to read the newspapers of recent months to see the type of information that is being put out into the public domain.  Clearly this information could only come from the banks or someone within the banks.  It is outrageous and wilful; there is no question of a mistake or of it being accidental.  The Minister of State should consider it in this light because I am not familiar with similar incidents in the private banks and it does not match the manner in which they conduct their business.  There has been a sea change and a change of culture in the State banks and the Minister should take control of the situation.  This goes beyond the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the helpful comments of my colleague on this issue.  The House has established in law an independent regulator, whose sole function is to protect data collected by all institutions in the State, whether they are State-owned or privately owned and whether they are banks or otherwise.  The independent regulator has a clear line of responsibility to deal with complaints made in the first instance.  The commissioner makes an annual report setting out his recommendations to the Government.  The commissioner would highlight the issues if he believed there were glitches in the legislation or new cultural practices, to which Deputy Mulherin adverted, in the State-owned banks or anywhere else.</P>
        <P>It behoves people who have been wronged in the way Deputy Mulherin has suggested to make a complaint to the regulator in the first instance.  In this case the regulator is the Data Protection Commissioner and it is his job to investigate the matter thoroughly.  If he believed this was part of some new systemic culture within the State-owned banking sector I presume he would report it.  I encourage Deputy Mulherin in concert with the people who have been wronged in this way to make a complaint in the first instance to the Data Protection Commissioner.  He reports to the Government every year and I am confident he would report any new systemic problem if he believed it had been unearthed as a result of his investigations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State with responsibility for this matter being in the House to take this issue.  The programme for Government states: &ldquo;We will reform public procurement to become a tool to support innovative Irish firms and to allow greater access to Irish small and medium sized businesses.&rdquo;  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister of State acknowledged, rightly, the concern that some small firms may be squeezed out of the public procurement market by centralised frameworks.  He stated: &ldquo;I am actively working with the small and medium enterprise sector to ensure that SMEs are better prepared to bid for public service contracts and barriers to their tendering are being identified and addressed.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Several of these SMEs have approached me.  In Ireland there are approximately 120 such firms involved in the provision of copiers and printers, etc. to the education system.  These firms have approximately 2,500 employees.  They maintain they are being squeezed because of the central framework mechanism.  They provided an illustration of their concerns relating to the forthcoming tender process for managed print services.  The criteria adopted as part of the tender process effectively eliminated 90% of these firms from the beginning because of the requirement of a minimum average turnover in the previous three years of not less than &euro;10 million.  Over the years all of these groups have built up a wonderful relationship with the schools and other organisations with which they have been dealing.  If we are to adopt this central framework we must ensure that this point is not overlooked.</P>
        <P>In many cases involving the provision of printers etc. there is a maintenance service programme as well.  Some service users, including principal teachers, end up ringing someone in Hong Kong to get direction on how to work a printer.  Naturally, when the language breakdown arises the telephone at the far end is put down but who suffers as a result?  The school and the children in the school.  This is a considerable problem which must be addressed according to the groups that have approached me.  I readily accept the comments of the Minister of State in the newspaper recently with regard to his overview of the sector but there is a need to act on this.  The Minister of State should follow up with the small and medium sized enterprises and other individual groups and open the door of his office to allow them to present their case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  He is right to suggest the issue of procurement falls under my responsibility.  The national procurement service is part of the Office of Public Works.  Since its establishment in 2009, the service has done a tremendous job to ensure that we get better procurement throughout the public sector.  The truth is that far too many people are procuring in Ireland.  There are too many localised arrangements and there is not enough focus on cost and efficiency.  If we are to reach our 3% deficit target by 2015 it will not only involve slashing budgets and new taxes.  It is also about procuring better and ensuring that we get better value for money.  I am keen to ensure that as many Irish SMEs as possible win these contracts.  We are at one on that point.</P>
        <P>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular 10/10, introduced by the previous Government, has done several important things.  Previously, any contract of &euro;50,000 or less was not advertised on the e-tenders portal.  Now, every contract of &euro;25,000 or less is advertised.  The big problem facing Irish SMEs is that they are not all registered on the e-tenders portal.  How can they bid for something unless they know about it?  I wish to use the opportunity of the debate on the issue put forward by Deputy Wall to encourage the SME sector to register with us.  All public procurement must go through the e-tenders portal so that we know exactly what is on offer.  Circular 10/10 sought to get rid of the restrictive tendering processes through greater use of open tendering and this is very important for small Irish businesses.  In the circular we asked people to be proportionate and not to be overly burdensome when it comes to insurance and turnover requirements for SMEs.  It is crazy, as far as I am concerned, to say to an Irish SME that it needs a massive amount of insurance before it gets a job, and we will reform that even further.</P>
        <P>The fourth matter is trying to subdivide much of the work so that Irish SMEs can get more of the opportunities available.  This is a multi-billion euro business.  Throughout the Irish public sector, in excess of &euro;16 billion was spent last year on goods and services.  It is a great opportunity for new employment.</P>
        <P>Fifth, in Circular 10/10, we want SMEs to come together to ensure they could pitch for some of this business.  Deputy Wall referred to the managed print framework contract &mdash; I apologise I am not reading from my script, which the Deputy should not mind as the speech is the important matter.  Six companies were selected in that centralised procurement framework and three of those companies were Irish SMEs that won that framework.  My point is that if the Irish SME sector gets its act together, realises what we need from it in terms of better tendering and ensures that it is up to speed on the requirements under Circular 10/10, there is no reason they cannot win this business.</P>
        <P>Some 85% of contracts under public sector procurement in this country are won by Irish SMEs.  I want more of them to be won by them.  Despite the headlines one sometimes reads, 95% of all the money we spend in this area is retained in this country.  It is my ambition &mdash; I say it unapologetically &mdash; to get more Irish SMEs winning more of this.  They are already doing very well.  I want them to get the biggest possible share of the market that they can get.</P>
        <P>However, we also must drive price.  We must get the best value for the Irish taxpayer.  We must ensure the savings we make are all part of the national effort to balance our books and get the country&rsquo;s expenditure and taxes on an even keel.  For too long, this issue was not taken seriously.  Better public procurement, more central procurement and a much more professional focus on procurement across the system can deliver that change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State and his approach in this matter, but the facts, according to what I have been told, do not bear up what he stated on it.  The NPS stated that some of the SMEs could submit a joint tender.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Deputy Jack Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a possibility.  They are rivals each day of the week and it could take two to three weeks to put a tender together.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister of State.  What I am asking is that he goes the next step to ensure the National Procurement Service enters into dialogue with the SME national organisations to give them the opportunity to take up his challenge.  If the NPS continues to state that unless a SME has an income of &euro;10 million over the past three years it is not at the races, then what the Minister of State is saying will not hold up and the SMEs in Ireland will fall by the wayside.</P>
        <P>There is no sense in saying that it can happen if we do not underpin it to ensure that it does happen.  I am asking the Minister of State, whose side I am on in the challenge we face, not to rule out our own companies because we put a mechanism in place that the previous Government thought was appropriate.  That is no reason to say that we think it is appropriate.  We must accept the challenge to ensure the position of SMEs.  With 2,500 workers, we cannot wipe them off the slate as simple as that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputy Wall for raising this issue.  If we are to get value for the Irish taxpayer, this is a crucial debate this country needs to have.</P>
        <P>I very much agree with Deputy Wall as well.  We cannot allow any of these jobs to be lost, but the only way those jobs will be saved is by better procurement and people understanding our requirements as well.  All over the country, we have been having &ldquo;Meet-the-Buyer&rdquo; events, which are all about us explaining to the small guy what he needs to do for us in terms of making the tendering work.  I accept it is a dialogue between both sides.  The SMEs are crucial in that.  They are on the NPS board.  They are well represented.  I am conscious of their views.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wall is correct when he refers to this lunatic requirement that one needs &euro;10 million turnover in order to pitch for business.  That is because the local procurer, who is inserting that stipulation, is not applying Circular 10/10 in a proportionate way.  If I am looking for a contract for &euro;10,000, it is madness to state that one needs to have had a &euro;10 million turnover for the past three years.  That is because the local procurer has not the confidence to do as we suggest he should be doing &mdash; altering the terms so that the Irish SMEs can win some of this business.</P>
        <P>I very much agree with Deputy Wall.  We are at one on this.  It is about dialogue.  It is about ensuring that we meet those concerns of the Irish SMEs and I assure the Deputy that am absolutely up for that task.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the selection of the matter and for the opportunity to raise it.</P>
        <P>In recent times, I have received complaints about the ambulance service in counties Louth and Meath being somewhat erratic.  Whether or not that is because of some organisational difficulty, I do not know.</P>
        <P>Pre-hospital emergency care is vital.  If there is to be a dependable health service, the pre-hospital emergency care is vital to the provision of that service.  The ambulance response time is critical.  Where somebody is unwell and needs to get to hospital quickly, the ambulance must be available with the qualified personnel on board.</P>
        <P>If the service is understaffed, response times will suffer accordingly and one will finish up with a diminished service as a result.  The key performance indicators recommended by HIQA include appropriately trained personnel attending patients with life-threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest incidents within eight minutes in 75% of all cases.</P>
        <P>A number of parliamentary questions have been submitted here in this House and they indicate that those targets are not being met on a regular basis.  It begs questions about the position in the Louth-Meath ambulance service area.  Is there an issue with staff shortages and is there a truncated ambulance service as a result?  Is there sufficient paramedical staff available?</P>
        <P>Is there sufficient staff available where staff, for one reason or another, are not in a position to come to work?  If that is the issue, what is the plan of the HSE and, from now, the Department of Health?  This is a vital service.  The emergency hospital need can arise unexpectedly for anybody right across the country.</P>
        <P>It is fine to reform the health service, building the structures of the hospitals and the reconfiguration of the services within the hospitals, but the vital linkage is the ambulance service and the response time in that regard is equally important.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Health who, unfortunately, is unable to take this important issue, I thank Deputy Kirk for allowing me to address it.  I very much agree with Deputy Kirk, who has correctly highlighted the importance of having an ambulance service in place, not only in the north east but throughout the country, which is reliable and fit for purpose in terms of the requirements of a modern Irish health service.</P>
        <P>The national ambulance service, NAS, operates nine ambulance stations across the north-east region.  These provide emergency response services which include telephone assistance, assessment, treatment and stabilisation at the scene of an incident, and ongoing treatment during transport to the nearest appropriate medical facility.</P>
        <P>Emergency service staffing includes trained control and dispatch staff and highly qualified paramedics and advanced paramedics.  An emergency ambulance crew consists of two clinical staff, who will be paramedics, advanced paramedics or a combination of these, depending on the nature of the call out, availability and rostering.  In addition to the regional resources of the NAS, a memorandum of understanding is in place with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.  This provides for operational day-to-day co-operation and resource sharing in responding to 999 emergency calls on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>The emergency ambulance service provided by the NAS is not a static one.  The NAS deploys its resources in a dynamic manner, which means ambulance services are provided on an area and regional basis, as opposed to a local basis.  Ambulances and paramedic staff are no longer restricted to particular locations, stations or areas, as was the case under the old health board service arrangement.  Resources are also deployed across the area according to predictive analysis, so they are not necessarily in a station but where activity patterns indicate they are most likely to be required during a shift.  Accordingly, the emergency resources for a particular location include all available vehicles and personnel within the wider area.</P>
        <P>The dynamic deployment of emergency resources ensures the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident.  In the north-east area, this is achieved by the dynamic dispatch of resources from surrounding stations in the first instance.  In Drogheda, for example, the emergency resource immediately available for deployment in response to a 999 call includes all the surrounding stations.</P>
        <P>In responding to 999 calls, ambulance dispatchers prioritise resources according to clinical status.  All life-threatening conditions &mdash; cardiac, respiratory and other &mdash; receive first priority and the closest appropriate resource will be dispatched to these incidents.  The Deputy will appreciate what this means, namely, on occasion, an ambulance responding to a lower priority call will be diverted <i>en route</i> to respond to a clinically more urgent incident.  However, all efforts are made to then secure resources in the wider area to respond to the lower priority call.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will note that approximately 60% of all 999 calls made to the NAS are neither life threatening nor potentially life threatening.  Approximately 10% of all 999 calls to the NAS are inappropriate for an emergency ambulance.  These statistics are consistent with international experience and evidence.</P>

	<P>While I do not say this very often, I am particularly disappointed with the response.  The script the Minister of State has read could be used in response to any query about an ambulance service anywhere across the country.  The query I submitted was specific and referred to serious concerns about the rostering and manpower in the ambulance service in the north east.  I wish that those who prepared the response would address the particular points that are being raised because they are raised for very good and genuine reasons.  Concern does prevail about the matter.  I am not blaming the Minister of State and I admire his versatility in taking responsibility for a number of responses today.  However, the situation is very unsatisfactory.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Department of Health and ask it to re-examine the matter.  I would appreciate it if the Department would come back to me with a more detailed and specific response to the query I raised.</P>

I have at my disposal a more detailed briefing note which I intend to hand to him at the end of this debate and which sets out the issues in Drogheda and the region.  If there are specific issues around that, he might dialogue with the Minister for Health on them, which I hope will answer his questions more fully.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, is present because, this time last year, he attended a meeting in the Listowel Arms Hotel hosted by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  There were 500 or 600 people present that night and their anger as a consequence of the post-primary school transport system in the north Kerry area was evident.  I can tell the Minister of State it is an awful lot worse now than it was then.  Those of us who were public representatives were able to work with Bus &Eacute;ireann in a constructive way to facilitate the requirements of many of those who had concerns at that time.</P>
        <P>I want to bring the current situation to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention.  There is currently a 53-seat and a 49-seat bus service operating in Ardfert, Ballyheigue and Abbeydorney and servicing the Causeway Comprehensive School.  That service is operating at capacity and, while an extra 18 people from the Ardfert-Abbeydorney area need transport to the school for the coming year, there are no seats available for them.  This situation is replicated in the Ashdee, Tarbert and Ballybunion areas, and Kilflynn and every other village throughout north Kerry is experiencing similar circumstances.</P>
        <P>Students from Ardfert and Abbeydorney are consistently unable to gain entry to the nearest school, which is in Tralee, because the school admission policy favours students from the local feeder schools in Tralee, whose capacity is ever-increasing.  Yet, the Causeway area would be a feeder area for Ardfert, Ballyheigue, Abbeydorney and other villages.  The outcome of all of this is that, in one area, there are 18 students who have no seat and cannot get on the bus, whereas their brothers and sisters are currently using that bus to travel to Causeway Comprehensive School.  There is a similar situation in Ashdee, where nine students want to get on the bus but there are only three seats available, although they have brothers and sisters travelling to Tarbert or Ballybunion.  As they cannot get on the bus, they are compelled to try to get into schools in towns such as Listowel or Tralee.</P>
        <P>Something needs to be done.  I have met Bus &Eacute;ireann representatives and will meet them again on Monday.  It is an injustice to divide families when the parents went to these schools previously and when brothers and sisters must go to a different school.  It is ridiculous.  I hope the Minister of State will give this consideration and that he will be able to find a way to resolve the matter.</P>

Children starting primary school and requiring transport must now go to what is the nearest school but, in many cases, problems are being caused due to distance rules which might involve just 100m.  What savings can be made from 100m?  As Deputy Ferris said, families are being split up, with members of the one family being forced to go to different schools.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State is very aware of this and is making efforts to get it sorted out.  However, the situation will come to a head in August and September.  There are several examples in Mayo.  In Kilkelly, some 200 m in the difference means a bus goes to one school but no bus goes to the other school, to which first year students are being asked to go.  It is not as if there is a choice between the two because a tradition has built up in one direction.  In Knock, the bus passes the door of a child who is being denied access to it, again because of this distance rule.  In Ballyboy, a tradition that has built up over 40 years has been broken.  Where pupils are now in a different diocese, they will be forced to travel in a different direction from their natural shopping hinterland, sporting clubs and so on.  The same happens between Baal and Ballinrobe where the distance involved is 100m.</P>
        <P>If this goes ahead next September one member of a family will be collected at 8.10 a.m. and dropped off at 4.10 p.m. as is the case at present but their young sister will be picked up at 7.30 a.m. and dropped off at 4.30 p.m.  When this works through the system it will have major implications for schools that received investment for new and additional buildings in recent years.  There is no way that savings can be made from some of these decisions that are due to be implemented.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Deputies for raising this matter.  As they are both aware, school transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on the Department&rsquo;s behalf and covering over 82 million km annually.  Approximately 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Deputies are referring to the changes regarding school transport eligibility for children attending post-primary schools, which take effect from the beginning of the next school year.  At the outset I want to explain that the main objective of the Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme is to support the safe transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling, for reasons of distance, to their nearest school if transport is not supported.</P>
        <P>The current system for determining eligibility for school transport at post-primary level has been in place for over 40 years.  In 1966, when the Government announced the introduction of free post-primary education, the country was divided for planning purposes into geographic districts which we have now come to know as catchment areas, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Post-primary pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 km or more from their local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which they live.  The definition of school transport catchment boundaries has been the cause of many submissions and representations to the Department over the years.  It is widely considered by many that the current catchment boundary areas do not reflect changed demographics.</P>
        <P>Changes in the post primary school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011.  One of the changes which will take effect from this September means that the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering a post-primary school.  From this date, school transport eligibility for all new pupils entering a post-primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.  This eligibility criterion will be applied equitably on a national basis.</P>
        <P>In general, existing eligible children, including those who are not attending their nearest post-primary centre and who meet the distance criterion of 4.8 km, will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post-primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.  Siblings of these children and other children who are not attending their nearest school may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the post primary school transport scheme.</P>
        <P>Regarding the planning of school infrastructure, the general approach of the Department is to plan on the basis of pupils attending at their nearest primary schools and that those primary schools then feed into attendance at the nearest post-primary schools or the nearest post-primary centre generally.  The changes announced in post-primary school transport services are in line with this approach and ultimately will result in a more efficient and cost effective scheme.</P>
        <P>While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, eligibility for school transport is to the nearest school, having regard for ethos and language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about a feeder system but there is very little difference in the distance between Ardfert and Abbeydorney, for example, and Causeway Comprehensive School.  It is almost impossible to get into some of the post-primary schools in Tralee yet there is ample room in Causeway.  It is difficult to comprehend that in so far as people are being forced to go to a school that is bursting at the seams, yet the school of their choice, which their brothers and sisters might attend, does not qualify for primary school transport.  There are 18 people in one area waiting to get into Causeway and there is a 53 seat bus coming from that area to the Tralee school that is not full.  Some imagination is needed in that respect.  Changing the size of the bus could make a huge difference but that requires political will, and I do not see that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister accept that there will be implications for the schools and numbers in future years?  This is being done to achieve savings but over the years Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s accounts have shown that it is costing more to transport fewer children.  The cost in 2009 was &euro;1,266 per student.  In 2010 it cost &euro;1,392 per student and in 2011 the cost was &euro;1,526 per student.  There has been a 20% drop in the number of students availing of Bus &Eacute;ireann transport but the cost has increased.  I cannot understand these changes.  Families are being split up and the students&rsquo; sense of place in terms of where they have always gone is being discommoded.  This change will not turn around the transport costs.  It does not make sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to emphasise that in order to allow parents ample time to consider all their school options a 20 month gap was allowed between the announcement of this measure and the time when parents needed to apply for school transport for the coming school year.  Those changes were posted on the Department&rsquo;s website in October 2011 and the updated scheme was made available on 1 February this year.  I should add that the Department contacted post-primary schools directly on two occasions in addition to the relevant education partners formally advising them of the changes.</P>
        <P>Even in times of plenty one could never argue an economic case for transporting children other than to the school that is nearest to where they live.  Deputy Ferris may say that parents wish for their children to attend the school of their choice &mdash; all of us as parents wish that &mdash; but it is not possible, and never would be possible, to facilitate that choice by providing transport to the school of choice for every child in the country.</P>
        <P>The transport scheme is available to underpin the school system, particularly across rural Ireland, but it was not designed to bring every child to the school of their choice.  That is not what the system was about.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ferris pointed out that when we have the radii of two schools intermeshing with one another, situations will arise where a child who lives in one location is not entitled to transport to a particular centre while a child who lives 100 metres away is entitled to transport.  That will happen everywhere where those two radii meet.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony stated that there may be additional costs associated with perhaps providing new classrooms.  Research carried out by Bus &Eacute;ireann would indicate that 95% of pupils are already attending their nearest centre and therefore it is unlikely to result in significant capital costs involved in building new classrooms.  Second, if it is, that would be a once-off capital cost associated with that development whereas the savings accruing from a more efficient and cost effective school transport system will accrue to us year after year.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s comment about the cost of school transport, he is correct in pointing out that the cost per pupil has risen exponentially in recent years but that is because it includes 8,000 children with special needs who, because of their special needs and the special transport that needs to be provided for them, incur a far greater cost.  Some 8,000 children with special needs are being transported every day whereas a very short time ago very little of that was happening.  During the transitionary phase and while we allow the current cohort of students to work their way through the system, some anomalous situations will occur.  That is unavoidable, but it is a transitionary phase and, once complete, we will have a more efficient and cost-effective school transport system in place that will be fair, equitable and will be applied equitably throughout the country.</P>

        <QRef>[36214/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, administers the better energy programme, which includes the better energy homes and warmer homes and workplaces schemes.  Exchequer funding of &euro;76.146 million has been allocated to the better energy programme in 2012, which is projected to deliver 597 GWh in energy savings this year and is the equivalent of &euro;34.2 million in the value of energy saved.  The original budget allocation for the better energy programme for 2011 was &euro;60 million.  This was supplemented by the Government on taking office with an additional &euro;30 million under the jobs stimulus package, with the total outturn for 2011 amounting to &euro;94 million.  Based upon the SEAI&rsquo;s analysis, the funding supported the retention of more than 5,700 jobs for 2011 as a whole.  While the measurement of jobs created and retained is complex, the SEAI continues to monitor the relative labour intensity of the better energy programme.</P>
        <P>Since the start of 2012, there has been a notable decrease in applications across all measures in the better energy homes programme.  Analysis by the SEAI suggests a number of factors have impacted upon the level of new applications, including milder weather, reduced disposable income and some misconceptions about the continued availability of grants.  The SEAI continues to analyse the trends and underlying causes to inform decisions about the programme in the context of budget 2013.  In light of that, and to optimise the use of remaining funding for the rest of the year, I recently approved a reallocation within the better energy budget to enhance the funding allocated for better energy warmer homes and better energy workplaces.  This reallocation will support the retention of jobs in the retrofitting sector by redirecting funding towards areas of continued strong demand and related levels of economic activity in the sector.  It is the case that the notable decrease in better homes applications will have an impact, as yet unquantified, on the retrofitting industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that falling demand was one reason for his recent decision to divert some of the budget.  What level of demand is apparent currently in terms of the quantum of applications on hand?  Is the Minister minded to continue the scheme for the foreseeable future?  Everyone is aware of the benefits of the scheme but the circumstances of some people will change and they might find themselves in a position where they will be able to avail of the scheme even though for various reasons they have not been able to do so to date.  Will the scheme continue to exist in 2013 and 2014?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister minded to continue the parallel scheme that is running for recipients of the fuel allowance?  I do not recall the names of the agencies involved but in Limerick a body in Southill provides warmer homes funding for people who do not go through the SEAI scheme.  They go through the social welfare route with the minimum criterion that they are in receipt of the fuel allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the SEAI is still doing research to establish why there are fewer applications.  It is undoubtedly the case from previous studies that if the winter is very bad, the spike in applications is evident for anyone to see.  Therefore, the mild winter is plausible as a part explanation but it is not the full explanation.  It would appear that people are reluctant to put their hand in their pockets to match the grant aid.  The grant aid on offer is based on the presumption that people will come up with their own investment in insulation and retrofitting.</P>
        <P>On whether it is the intention to continue the scheme, the programme for Government commits to making the transition from a grants-based system to a pay-as-you-save model, a financial model that envisages repayment over a number of years.  It could be three or four years but it has not been fixed yet.  The payment will be made essentially from the savings that will accrue.  The intention is to continue the scheme for 2013, which is what interests Deputy Collins.</P>
        <P>My initial view was that minor adjustment to the grant levels for some functions might explain why there were fewer applications, but that does not explain it because where the grant did not change at all, the number of applications have declined by exactly the same amount.  The matter still bears some research.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the remaining budget for the rest of this year sufficient to meet the applications to the Department or the SEAI?  Has the Minister left people hanging?  I hope the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In fact, we will direct any extra money to the workplace scheme in particular, where there is increasing awareness and uptake on the part of SMEs.  It is not the case that there are not many householders in the queue.  It is just that the numbers have fallen.  There are many in the queue and they will not be left hanging.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>  his views on the standard of service provided by An Post; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36216/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.</P>
        <P>The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligation that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU postal services directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.</P>
        <P>An Post discharges its universal service provision and through it the obligation to deliver mail on every working day to all premises in the country.  This service is complemented by a nationwide retail footprint via the post office network.  The latter provide valuable services to the population, including payment of social welfare benefits.  In addition, An Post is leveraging its retail footprint to provide other services such as banking, insurance and the administration of State savings schemes.  I consider that An Post provides a valuable nationwide service to the public.</P>
        <P>More generally, as shareholder, I do have a strong concern about the ongoing commercial position of the company and I regularly liaise with the company in this regard.  The reality is that the core mail business has suffered a major fall-off and that has impacted seriously on the company&rsquo;s revenue flow.  In response, the company is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business.  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the company the need to exploit further its unique position in this regard and I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams to win a wider range of commercial contracts, including within the public sector, offering higher margins and keeping costs down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am certain all Members agree that An Post provides an excellent service, both in respect of the service it is compelled to provide and in respect of its social role in maintaining contact with people, particularly those who are more isolated from the general community.  I am somewhat puzzled by the decision of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to take a case against An Post on the grounds that it is failing to fulfil its target of next-day delivery.  In the ten years I have been a Member of this House I have received many complaints about ComReg, but I can honestly state I have received no complaint about An Post.  According to sources within An Post, ComReg has refused to state where the alleged failures are and has not provided hints as to how matters might improve.  Instead, it appears this case will potentially be the cause of the imposition of a &euro;12 million fine on An Post, which would be detrimental to it as a service provider.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the case being taken?  Does he agree ComReg has once again highlighted its deficiencies as a regulator?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm for the Deputy that legal proceedings have been commenced by the independent regulator, ComReg, against An Post on the basis that the company has failed to achieve the next-day delivery targets fixed by ComReg.  The application by ComReg seeks to have imposed a financial penalty of &euro;11.9 million on An Post for breach of the quality of service standard as measured by ComReg in 2010 and 2011.  As the Deputy will be aware, ComReg is the independent regulator in this regard.  I can accept that next-day delivery is a valid measure of postal standards.  However, most Members of the House would share the view advanced by the Deputy that this issue is not a chief concern for postal users, at least not as conveyed to Members.  In the context of the financial and commercial challenges confronting An Post, failure to achieve a nationwide 94% target for next-day delivery is scarcely the primary issue.  Against this background, I am obliged to note I share the experience of the Deputy and other Members across all parties when I state complaints about next-day delivery do not feature among the matters brought to Members&rsquo; attention concerning the postal services.  No Member, including those in government, wishes to see one State organisation engaged in litigation against another, especially in the midst of the critical financial crisis in which the country finds itself.  However, the fact remains that ComReg is statutorily independent in the discharge of this and all of its other functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is mind-boggling at a time when An Post is attempting to diversify and provide an even greater service, that ComReg effectively is attempting to impose a penalty on the company that certainly will not improve the services it provides.  I do not believe I have heard of any Deputy ever having received a complaint about An Post in respect of next-day delivery.  An Post provides a fantastic service that, as legislators, Members should be prepared to defend against anyone who is so-called independent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a reasonable question as to the extent to which the imposition of a penalty of &euro;11.9 million on An Post would correct the perceived deficiency.  Greater challenges than this face An Post.  I suspect the extent of electronic substitution, the decline in its core business, the challenges that confront it from competition and so on rank higher in the matters that confront its management.  Consequently, I must concede I share the surprise that there are such legal proceedings.  Preferably, one hopes two public organisations can resolve this issue consistent with the remit of the independent regulator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the regulation of gas prices is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s gas tariffs for domestic customers continue to be regulated by the CER and are reviewed each year.  I have no function in the matter.  The regulator is undertaking its annual detailed review of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy, BGE, tariff.  This involves detailed assessment by the regulator of BGE&rsquo;s own recent proposals on gas prices, followed by a consultation process, which will begin at the end of July.  The level of increase in the tariff will not become clear until BGE&rsquo;s detailed submission is fully analysed.  I am advised that a decision by the regulator is likely to follow at the end of August on whether any increase should be applied to the BGE tariff from 1 October next.  In making its decision the regulator takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.  These would include the price of gas in the global market, currency fluctuations and financing cost-efficient network investment for safety and reasons of security of supply.</P>
        <P>There are a number of ways for consumers to take actions on rising gas prices, and measures are in place to assist them.  They can shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers, bearing in mind that other suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products to those charged by BGE.  They can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their gas usage, which delivers demonstrable savings.</P>
        <P>The regulator is working with gas suppliers to ensure vulnerable customers are protected through, <i>inter alia</i>, the installation of pay-as-you-go meters.  The long-term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s energy affordability strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an anomaly in that the wholesale price of gas on the international commodity market is falling, while, at the same time, Bord G&aacute;is is seeking a 10% increase.  The public is finding this difficult to understand and while that is not too bad, it will find it even harder to pay.  As an entire set of new charges, including water charges and property taxes, will be rolled out in the next few years, everything possible must be done to try to curb and control the price of fuel, energy and electricity.  While the Minister has stated the regulator is independent, which may be the case, to what extent does the regulator consider the public interest from the perspective of how people will actually pay for such an increase?  When making this point, I am mindful, for example, of the recent survey conducted by the Irish League of Credit Unions which, to its credit, is a broadly based and independent organisation that is to be found in every community throughout the country.  Its recent survey of people&rsquo;s disposable incomes and the remainder thereof at the end of a particular month has credibility.  Moreover, it was conducted on a cientific and factual basis and showed that the majority of families of their membership did not have any disposable income available to them at the end of the year.  When the regulator informs itself, will the Minister ensure it takes into consideration the aforementioned survey carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions because it was a fine piece of work?  The majority of people, particularly in urban settings, who are members of the credit union movement will find themselves in the category of those who face hardship.</P>
        <P>In order to inform the regulator properly, can the Minister ensure that he gets that survey as part of his decision making process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will indeed ensure the regulator is fully cognisant of the contents of that report.  There is a long way to go on the analysis of whether any price increase in warranted.  The main drivers in international gas prices are the euro-sterling exchange rate, network costs and volume consumption trends.  The weak euro may indeed have assisted many of our SMEs in exporting from the country in recent times, but it works the other way when importing fossil fuels such as gas and oil.  That has been an issue.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that I will bring that report to the attention of the regulator.  I have already communicated my views to the regulator, especially in so far as they relate to protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  The regulator reports that there has been a very good uptake in &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; meters and that the fears last winter about disconnections and so on largely did not materialise.  The protocols we put in place at the time &mdash; no disconnections provided the customer signs up to a pay plan or installs a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; meter &mdash; have been quite effective.  I would like a faster rate of uptake of the meters and I hope that takes place between now and the beginning of the winter.</P>

	<P>The matters raised by the Deputy are operational matters for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The company&rsquo;s gas safety operators are regulated in accordance with the safety regulatory framework established by the Commission for Energy Regulation, which has statutory responsibility for gas safety.  I have no function in this regard.</P>
        <P>The first incident referred to by the Deputy occurred in May 2010, as Bord G&aacute;is Networks was inspecting the Curraleigh West to Midleton pipeline prior to bringing the pipeline into operation.  BGN advises that the gauge used in the inspection showed evidence of having been subjected to abnormally high temperatures.  There was no evidence of an explosion and the underground pipeline was not breached.  Further testing was undertaken and the line has been re-tested on a number of subsequent occasions and is operating satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>Following this incident, BGN commissioned an independent external review of procedures in relation to this incident and, based on the review findings, made amendments to technical commissioning and purging procedures.  The national gas safety committee, chaired by the CER and representing the gas industry, the Health and Safety Authority and my Department, monitored this incident throughout and continues to supervise the ongoing BGN analysis into the technical issues involved, which the committee has determined was not a pipeline integrity issue.</P>
        <P>Investigations by the regulator and by BGE have been carried out to establish the cause of the gas incident which occurred in Leixlip last January.  The regulator&rsquo;s investigation has been informed by work carried out by Burgoynes, UK-based experts in such investigations, with considerable experience in the Irish gas market.</P>
        <P><i>Information not provided on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>BGN&rsquo;s investigation into Leixlip is ongoing due to legal and other issues and the unavoidably protracted process of interviews with all the parties involved.  The completion of the investigations and subsequent findings continues to be overseen by the national gas safety committee.  BG&Eacute; operates safety management systems, technical audit and inspection and training programmes across all activities of its networks business which encompass its own staff, business partners and contractors employed for network maintenance and safety works.</P>
        <P>Safety is BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s first priority and the company is committed to ongoing development and maintenance of the gas networks and systems to ensure safety and to deliver continuous safety improvement and performance.  I have every confidence in BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s priority commitment to safety and its safety and emergency response service.  There is never room for complacency however, and BG&Eacute; itself is correctly engaged in a constant process of safety review and enhancement, working with CER.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and I accept his point that it is an operational matter.  I do not want to be scaremongering, but I have good information that there was an explosion not too far from the Tipperary border.  The Minister may say there is an independent internal review and that it was not a pipeline integrity issue, but I still have huge worries.  I would not have had a clue about those pipelines only that I saw the helicopter flying overhead when it was being developed.  It was a tremendous job of work and I saw the testing that went on at the time.</P>
        <P>The worry is that the competent contractors that Bord G&aacute;is has had in place since long before the pipeline was built are no longer in place.  Commitments are not being honoured by Balfour Beatty, among others, which got the contracts to carry out the work.  There are major worries about this and while I do not want to peddle misery, it will be too late to talk about it if something serious happens and standards lapse in these companies, some of which have experience here but many of which do not.  Many of them do not have the knowledge, expertise, capabilities or responsibilities.  They are in at low cost, but we cannot afford this for a major piece of energy infrastructure, nor we can we afford it from a health and safety point of view more importantly.  The Health and Safety Authority closes down small businesses and farms every day of the week, and rightly so if there are problems, but this is a major issue of national importance and that is why I put down the question.  I appeal to the Minister to insist that there is some fairness and continuity of good practice, which was delivered by the many contractors of Bord G&aacute;is for decades, one of them in my own town of Clonmel &mdash; MP Ryan and Company &mdash; and which have since been left high and dry, while companies with possible shoddy records are doing this work.  That cannot happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I must confess that I did not even know about this incident until the Deputy put down the question.  However, I was only recently engaged in exchanges in the House with Deputy Catherine Murphy about the unfortunate incident that happened at Leixlip.  There is a very careful safety framework in place and it is effectively supervised by the national gas safety committee, which includes organisations like the Health and Safety Authority and technical personnel from my Department.</P>
        <P>It is important to state that there was no explosion, nor is there any evidence that the underground pipeline was breached.  It is true that the inspection revealed evidence of abnormally high temperatures, but there was not an explosion and the pipeline was not breached.  Going back over the years, the safety record of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is very good.  I was in Cork recently and met senior personnel in the company and they are very proud of their record on this.  I think I can give Deputy McGrath the assurance he is looking for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the company has a proud record.  I am just worried on behalf of people who come to me.  I cannot say whether there was an explosion or not, but I am told there was.  I am not doubting the Minister&rsquo;s word.  My worry is that there is a serious slippage of standards with the changeover in companies and organisations.  We cannot afford that because it will be too late when something serious happens.  The proud standards that we had must be adhered to.  They were delivered by people with knowledge of the area and with all the expertise and qualifications and I would be worried, with the cut-price race to the bottom, that we would have an inferior service and maintenance.  In spite of the Health and Safety Authority and everything else, it is something that could happen.  I do not want that to happen and I know the Minister does not either.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on large parts of the media being controlled by a single owner; if he will introduce legislation to limit the percentage ownership of our media by any one person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[36894/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of media ownership and the concentration of that ownership in the hands of limited numbers of individuals is a sensitive and critical issue for governments in every developed country.  It is all the more so here due to our small scale and the relative ease with which this concentration can occur.  The reason this issue is such a critical one stems obviously from the critical role the media plays in our democracy and the potentially harmful effects an overconcentration of media ownership may have on the freedom of the press and on the plurality of views available to the public.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Government approved the draft heads of a new consumer and competition Bill, as submitted by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, who has primary responsibility for promulgating it.  Part of that decision involved giving effect in legislation to the recommendations of the report of the advisory group on media mergers and to transfer responsibility for public interest considerations relating to media mergers from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to my Department.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to implementing a set of robust measures that will allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases and to do so as quickly as possible.  Officials from my Department are actively engaged in the drafting process and I have written to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the subject on several occasions around the Bill&rsquo;s content.  My primary concerns are that it pays sufficient attention to the preservation of media plurality and to diversity in media, as well as providing that the powers are sufficient to ensure the Government can act when these are threatened.</P>
        <P>The consumer and competition Bill 2012 is one of a large number of Bills currently being drafted by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I gather it is likely to be later in the year before a draft Bill is ready to be published by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and brought before the Oireachtas.  In the meantime, the existing provisions set out in the Competition Act 2002 continue to apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to put my question again.  He is very fair to let me in as I was not here earlier when I should have been.  I apologise for that.</P>
        <P>What is the role of the media?  Is its role to make a fortune for someone or is it to report the news accurately?  I know the realities of business mean that one has to make money at it if one wants to keep it going.  At the level that some people are running the media, it is not about delivering the news but controlling it.  I am glad the Minister said something will be done about it because it seriously threatens democracy.</P>
        <P>Many times in the Chamber when I look up at the Press Gallery I ask myself who is really going to get the message out of here.  When they listen to what we have to say, what sort of mangle does it go through before it is actually reported?  In my opinion it goes through one particular mangle that constantly attacks anyone who is not of a right-wing view.  This needs to be tackled because it is not on.  In a democracy, everyone should have their say, should be reported equally and be treated fairly.  That does not happen, however.  Two large national radio stations are owned by the one person.  That is not acceptable and something needs to be done about it immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that the media is not like other businesses and media enterprises are not like other enterprises because of the formative role media can have on the very character of our democracy and the coverage of public affairs.  I agree with him that diversity of content and ownership are central.  The Sreenan report sets out several principles concerning the public interest test which are central to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>The heads of the new competition Bill were approved last July.  I regret an amount of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme has been dislocated at the behest of the troika to cause other legislation to receive attention.  The new competition Bill is proceeding, however, and will have regard to the Sreenan principles.  It will transfer responsibility for the media to my Department and, in the interim, my Department is working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to produce the best legislation we can.  Hopefully, it will meet the challenge Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan has put to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister is serious about tackling this matter at a micro level in Leinster House.  I find the system which decides on who sits in the Press Gallery astonishing.  The single owner I referred to earlier has someone in Leinster House who controls who comes in and out of the Gallery.  This needs to be addressed.  While there may be nothing untoward going on in this regard, it is about how it is perceived.  How else can one perceive it when the chief political correspondent of the largest newspaper in the country has a major say over who else can report on what is happening in the D&aacute;il?  Will the Minister address this matter as well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>From long years of experience, I am unlikely to dip my toe into organising who should sit in the Press Gallery.  Detailed matters such as that might be best avoided.</P>
        <P>Undue concentration of media ownership in Ireland would be unacceptable.  I hope the legislation, when published, will reflect that.  The media has a powerful influence in reporting and analysing current affairs.  It is important, as the Deputy said, that different points of view are fairly represented.  One person&rsquo;s negative media coverage may be seen quite differently by somebody else.  We live in a valley of negativity at the moment for reasons to do with the economic collapse of four years ago.  There ought to be room, however, for different analyses and points of view.  That diversity and plurality of view ought to be reflected in a healthy media and democracy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has decided to dispose of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy business and some of the ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity as part of the State assets disposal programme.  The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining the electricity and gas networks, as well as the two gas interconnectors in State ownership as national strategic infrastructure, critical for the delivery of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies.</P>
        <P>The ESB will remain a vertically integrated utility, positioned more competitively in the all-island energy market and, in due course, in the integrated European market.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is energy will support this dynamic, successful company and its employees to continue to invest and grow while enhancing competition in the energy market for the benefit of the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>I do not envisage job losses in the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as an outcome of the planned disposals.  The proposed sales can deliver positive outcomes for Ireland&rsquo;s energy markets, the two State utilities and their employees, consumers and business.  In this context, it is also important to underline that the Government has successfully negotiated with the troika to ensure that 50% of the sale proceeds will be available for reinvestment under the recently announced infrastructure stimulus package.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in implementing the asset disposal programme, in line with our commitments under the EU-ECB-IMF funding programme.  Tender processes for the appointment of financial advisers to oversee the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy have now commenced.  My Department is also progressing priority actions to address necessary legislative, regulatory and financial issues with a view to commencing the disposal process in 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has reassured me to some extent with regard to the position of the ESB.  However, I am concerned in respect of what is happening with Bord G&aacute;is in the context of its contracting work out to a company called Balfour Beatty.  The process in this regard does not bode well for the future.  I do not understand the technical aspects involved but binding national agreements were made to the effect that jobs would be maintained during the transfer.  I am familiar with a well-established private company, M. P. Ryan Limited, in Clonmel, County Tipperary, and I am concerned about what is going to happen to its employees.  These people have been treated very unfairly.</P>
        <P>I tried to raise this matter as a Topical Issue.  Deputy Martin Ferris raised it some time ago.  While the Labour Court is examining the matter, the workers to whom I refer are being treated unfairly and are being pitted against the company that is providing the services.  Pickets were placed at the premises of the company in Clonmel to which I refer, which had done all in its power to retain its employees and ensure that its various contractual agreements were fulfilled.  It is sad when something of that nature occurs, particularly as the workers had good relations with the company and the latter was trying its best to look after them.  Honest answers could not be obtained from Balfour Beatty and, as a result, legal advice had to be obtained and the Rights Commissioner Service had to be consulted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy might ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept this is a delicate matter.  However, is the Minister in a position to indicate whether, if further privatisation occurs, assurances will be given to consumers and safeguards will be put in place in respect of both employees and private contractors of good standing whose services have previously been used by companies such as Bord G&aacute;is?  I am not stating that these private contractors have a right to retain contracts for ever.  I am of the view, however, that where they are in place, contractual arrangements should be honoured.  The Minister indicated that a financial consultant will be appointed to oversee the financial aspects involved in privatisation.  Will he take steps to ensure that any commitments made and contractual arrangements entered into will be honoured?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has acknowledged that no private company has a right to expect to retain any given contract.  I presume he also accepts that it is not my job to micromanage matters in respect of contractors which might be recruited by Bod G&aacute;is, as it is currently configured, or by a new privatised Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  Management make these calls and companies sometimes win contracts, while at other times they lose them.  That is the rule of the marketplace.  My concern is to ensure &mdash; as stated in connection with the previous question &mdash; that whomsoever is recruited for the provision of services by the main company is up to delivering leading-edge services.  The quality of the services provided must measure up to best practice.  I cannot become involved in the business of recommending one contractor over another or of intruding into the company&rsquo;s micromanagement of contractual engagements.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  when he expects gas from the Corrib gas field to become available to the Irish consumer; the extent to which the product will replace the use of imported energy on an annual basis when supplies become available nationally; the degree to which the supply is expected to represent as a percentage total gas use; if all the necessary steps have been taken in terms of compliance with all statutory regulations in order to ensure the earliest possible availability; if he expects the product to be competitively priced on the Irish market; the extent to which he expects this to contribute to economic recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35716/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Corrib gas field will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply and at peak production will provide approximately 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas needs.  Completion of the Corrib field development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to definitely state when gas from the Corrib field will become available.  The developer is in receipt of all statutory permits relevant to the construction of the Corrib gas project.  Works on all elements of the development, with the exception of the onshore element of the Corrib pipeline, are essentially complete.  Works in this regard commenced in July 2011 and oversight of them is being undertaken by the appropriate authorities &mdash; Mayo County Council, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and my Department &mdash; in the context of their respective consents.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, which includes a 5 km tunnel, which began last year, will take approximately three years.  First gas cannot, therefore, reasonably be anticipated before 2014.</P>
        <P>With regard to how competitive the price of Corrib Gas is expected to be, Deputy Durkan should note that developers of new sources of gas price their supplies in keeping with the competitive nature of the market.  I have no statutory function in the setting of the price of gas.  Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory body.</P>
        <P>In terms of the contribution the development in question will make to economic recovery, as already alluded to, it can be expected that Corrib gas will improve security of gas supply.  This is of economic importance in light of Ireland&rsquo;s widespread use of natural gas, including for a significant element of energy generation.  In addition, Deputy Durkan may be aware that profits from petroleum production arising from exploration licences granted prior to 2007 are taxed at a rate of 25%.  This is the rate that will apply in the case of profits from the Corrib field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Have any lessons been learned from what occurred in respect of this project, particularly in light of its extraordinarily long duration?  Is the Minister in a position to indicate what might be expected in the future if further finds occur?  The procedures followed in respect of the Corrib gas project were extremely circuitous.  Has a new or better way of bringing gas to the market much more quickly been identified?  In the context of the statutory and safety requirements &mdash; I presume all of these have been complied with &mdash; is there anything that can be learned from the process to date which might be of economic benefit to both the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the country in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I published a major Government policy statement yesterday on the delivery of energy infrastructure.  A significant part of what is envisaged in this regard involves setting down principles of both community engagement and community gain.  Both of those principles are equally relevant in this case.  At the beginning of the Corrib project, a good relationship was fostered with the local community.  It appears, however, that, under the new arrangement, the company took its eye off the ball and issues that were raised in respect of safety were not handled in as sensitive a fashion as might have been the case.  Of course, we have moved on a great deal since then.  The State has bent over backwards to ensure, in so far as is humanly possible, that there are no safety concerns.  The campaign that emerged has moved from safety concerns to entirely different preoccupations.  It has been damaging to the country&rsquo;s international reputation.  Deputy Durkan is correct that the industry and the Government must learn lessons from the experience at Corrib.  The greatest concern is that, in circumstances where the country has been drilling one hole or two holes on average every year, the impact may be to deter companies from exploration and drilling off our shore and that is not in the best economic interests of the country.  Lessons can be learned and I hope we have learned them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the process followed in this jurisdiction compare with competing jurisdictions in terms of the procedure, compliance and the delay between the initial exploration and the final outcome?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Compared to similar circumstances, it took approximately three times as long to bring it ashore in this jurisdiction from discovery of the field to the likely date of 2014.  That is not justifiable because a great deal of cost can be written down by the company, a great deal of tax is forgone by the State and a huge bill is incurred by the State in providing security in the form of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular.  It does not bear favourable comparison with the international experience but I would also like to think it is a once-off.  The experience at Kinsale, for example, is quite different.  To go back to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s original question, I hope lessons have been learned.</P>

	<P>Officials of my Department have had contacts with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on onshore exploration authorisations in place in the two jurisdictions.  The primary purpose of these contacts has been to facilitate an exchange of information on the nature of the activities that have been licensed and their associated timelines.  There has also been a sharing of information on the regulatory processes that would apply in each jurisdiction should the promoters of these projects make applications to advance to an exploration drilling phase or beyond.</P>
        <P>The focus of these engagements has been on information sharing and not on seeking to agree a joint North-South policy.  In the case that a project in either jurisdiction were to advance to the next stage, it would be subject to the regulatory processes that pertain in that jurisdiction.  The environmental consideration of any proposed project in either jurisdiction will be subject to EU environmental legislation, including the provisions relating to consultation across borders where there could be a potential negative environmental impact in a neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>A meeting between authorities both North and South took place in February of this year, which provided an opportunity for a more detailed engagement and sharing of information between the respective regulators, together with a commitment to keep each other informed on relevant developments.  Additionally, officials from Northern Ireland are represented among the bodies engaged in scoping the more detailed research to be commissioned by the EPA later this year, on the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.</P>

        <Quest>  if any cost benefit analysis has been carried out to determine the possible advantage of semi-State led development of the world&rsquo;s best wind and wave renewable energy resource off the Irish coast using EIB loans; and if he will instruct that such a cost benefit analysis be organised.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>While offshore wind is already being deployed in a number of EU member states, it is still a very expensive technology to deploy.  Offshore wind currently costs in the region of &euro;3 million per MW to deploy compared to the cost of onshore wind which is about half of that.  Wave energy technology is still very much at the research and development stage and the commercial and technical feasibility is not yet proven.  While there are very promising wave technology devices in development, they are at pre-commercial stages.  Hence, it is not yet at a stage where large scale commercial scale development for the generation of electricity could take place. </P>
        <P>The national wave energy sector has been supported over recent years through the ocean energy development unit in Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Support has included a prototype development fund of research grants to industry, the enhancement of the wave tank test facility in the hydraulics and maritime research centre in Cork and the development of a quarter scale prototype wave test site in Galway Bay.  Further work includes preliminary design and survey work on a full scale wave test site off County Mayo.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very small electricity market, with around 2 million electricity consumers.  Given the very significantly higher price of developing offshore wind compared to the lower cost onshore, it makes economic sense that we focus on developing less costly onshore wind resources to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s binding EU targets for renewable electricity.  It is not the Government&rsquo;s intention that Irish consumers fund offshore wind development through a feed-in-tariff.  Wave energy technology is not yet commercially viable and is therefore appropriately supported by research and development funding.  This position applies to all projects, irrespective of whether they are developed privately or by the semi-State companies.  The best future for Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind resource lies in becoming an export industry.</P>
        <P>The renewable energy directive provides the mechanism by which the renewable value of electricity can be traded.  I am working bilaterally with my UK colleagues to create the necessary framework to enable trading between our two countries.  Any project development that takes place for export has to occur under the auspices of a legal inter-governmental agreement with the UK under Directive 2009/28/EC.  There are currently a number of project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export.  The manner in which projects falling under the intergovernmental agreement would be selected remains to be established.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>The agreement with the UK will be developed in a way which ensures a mutually beneficial arrangement and to ensure tangible economic benefits for Ireland.  If renewable energy power is being exported and consumed in the UK, then UK consumers will have to provide the necessary financial support to make the development commercially viable.  These costs will not fall on Irish energy consumers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s response is disappointing and seems to contain contradictions with the Labour Party&rsquo;s energy revolution policy proposal.  In opposition, the Labour Party had identified the enormous potential of wind and wave power on environmental grounds and in terms of job creation.  Some 20,000 jobs in ocean energy, 10,700 jobs in wind energy and 7,000 jobs in construction were talked about three years ago.  The basis of the Minister&rsquo;s answer dampens the potential of this area.  The question asked whether the Department had carried out a cost benefit analysis and I must pose the question again.  We pose the question on the day the National Competitiveness Council scorecard came out and rated Ireland&rsquo;s performance as abysmal in terms of environmental sustainability.  We are 24th out of 28 in energy from renewable sources.  We have slipped two places since the last scorecard.  It is just not good enough and the Government will be judged on this.  Private companies are considering this.  Why should they be the ones to benefit from it?  The geographical conditions are unique and the semi-State sector should make this investment for all the reasons proposed by the Minister when the Labour Party was in opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Daly is confusing many things in that peroration and, in the process, misrepresenting the policy of the Labour Party then and of the Government now.  This matter is attracting enormous concentrated attention.  We will proudly deliver on our extraordinarily ambitious target of 40% generation of electricity from renewables by 2020.  As I said in my reply, I am in negotiations with the British Energy Secretary with a view to concluding a memorandum of understanding on an international framework to permit trade in renewable energy from this country to the neighbouring island.  That holds out the prospect of significant employment.  We have a relatively small market in Ireland, amounting to some 7,000 MW on an all-island basis.  We may well have the capacity to generate much more provided we have an export outlet.  There is no point, however, in generating electricity which we cannot use because storage is a problem.  It is a very exciting area and some of the proposals announced in recent weeks by large-scale players in the industry are very interesting.  However, they cannot proceed until an intergovernmental framework is in place, which I hope will be the case by the end of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The 40% target was agreed upon when the Labour Party was in opposition.  Unfortunately, the figures show there has been some slippage since then.  The point is that we have a hugely undervalued potential resource.  As the Minister observed, wave energy is hugely expensive.  Although its development is essentially in its infancy, it is progressing well and there is no reason that we cannot be world leaders in this area.  Why should a semi-State company not spearhead that development rather than leaving it to the private concerns lining up on the wings to benefit out of it, as they will do in the case of the Corrib gas field?  This is a resource for the people and something which can stimulate job creation.  That is what the Minister&rsquo;s party argued for in opposition &mdash; I have read the document &mdash; and I would have assumed its policy in government would correspond.  Will the Minister respond to my question on the cost-benefit analysis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Competitiveness Council report to which Deputy Clare Daly referred indicates that Ireland is among the countries in Europe most dependent on oil as a source of energy consumption.  The latest figures show that in the first quarter of this year, exports increased by some 2.5% while imports rose by 5%.  The price of oil, over which we have no control, is a huge factor in that.  Does the Government see any potential to address this problem by way of investment in renewable energies?  There is a serious difficulty in that oil prices are something over which we have no control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Clare Daly on her reading matter.  I recommend, however, that at least for the month of August she might apply a more eclectic test to her reading by moving beyond Labour Party policy documents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I can guarantee the Minister that I will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to hear it.  I do not know why the Deputy is complaining about what we are doing in the area of wave energy technology, given that she acknowledges it is in its infancy and is only at the research stage.  I do not see how I am supposed to pull a switch and work wonders until such time as the technology is proven.  In the interim, we are supporting research in this area by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy development unit.  In these times of extraordinary constraint of resources we are managing to keep it going.  I recently approved funding, for example, for new facilities at the Beaufort research laboratory in Ringaskiddy, which will support the wave research testing that is going on there.</P>
        <P>The potential for the development of an export capacity in this area is very exciting.  However, Deputy Daly will have to explain from where, if it is to be done exclusively through the State companies, the huge investment that is required will come.  People tend to think of wind energy as nice and fluffy and green and to observe that there is plenty of it about the place.  However, there are economic issues at play here and the investment undertaken by the large-scale industry players is enormous.  We do not have those levels of resources to work with.  This is not to say that I do not foresee a role for some of the State companies as these projects develop.  We have thousands of acres of cut-away bog and 7% of our land is under afforestation.  In the ESB we have one of the most successful indigenous energy companies anywhere in the world, comparing scale with scale.  I would be very partial to that body playing whatever partnership role it can in this process and getting a share of the action.  However, the notion that we can source billions in order to fund developments in this area is not realistic.  Although I wish it were possible, it simply is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister whether a cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken in respect of obtaining loans from the European Investment Bank in order to carry out this work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it has.  It is only possible to obtain EIB loans for projects which the bank approves and where matching or better State financing is being put up.  We are not remotely in that space.  We should bear in mind that there is no template here and no intergovernmental agreement in place.  If something emerges from our negotiations with Britain, it will be the first such agreement as between any two trading states.  If we can, as I am confident we will, develop an export capacity in this area, it will be one of the most exciting developments in the industrial sector in decades.  The notion that we can exploit a plentiful indigenous resource and that a neighbouring island has a matching need in order to meet its renewable targets and energy requirement, which would suggest a win-win situation, is a very exciting prospect.  We are proceeding with all haste in this matter.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mick Wallace is correct in his observation regarding our dependence on oil and our enormous import bill of some &euro;6 billion per annum.  What we are discussing here will certainly facilitate our efforts to reduce that dependency, ensure greater reliability of renewables and, in the process, provide cheaper power to consumers and businesses.  The Corrib gas field, about which Deputy Bernard Durkan expressed concern some moments ago, will supply 60% of our need at peak, but it will not, unless we are successful off Dalkey, obviate the necessity to continue importing oil.  One never knows what might happen and there would be a considerable welcome in the area for a major oil field.  In the absence of such a discovery, we must import oil.  Our objective is to reduce that dependence and enhance the reliability of renewables.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is probably aware of the Bill brought forward by his party colleague and my constituency colleague, Senator John Kelly, to increase the requirement regarding distances between onshore wind turbines and residential properties.  Does he consider this proposal a runner and might it have any impact on efforts to reduce oil dependency?</P>
        <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte: Yes.  One can only obtain EIB loans for projects which the bank approves and if the State is putting up matching or better finance.  We are not even remotely in that space.  We should bear in mind that there is no trmp  It has obviously come from complaints from people in my general area who are unhappy with the current guidelines for building wind turbines beside people&rsquo;s houses.  What does the Minister think of what he proposes, or is he aware of what he proposes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very aware of it.  As recently as yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, and I met Senator Kelly and some of his colleagues about his Bill.  His Bill has certainly attracted a great deal of support, which I acknowledge.  He raised an issue which is a matter of concern for some residents.  The Minister of State, Deputy  O&rsquo;Sullivan, and her officials are engaged in further discussions with him in the matter of the appropriateness of the guidelines to which the Deputy referred.</P>
        <P>My view is that this issue is better dealt with through more flexible guidelines than through rigid primary legislation.  We had some discussion for over an hour and a quarter yesterday about the kind of things such guidelines would have to encompass.  A turbine 500 m from one&rsquo;s house, which happens to be behind a mountain, is not exactly intruding on one&rsquo;s house but if it is twirling over one&rsquo;s roof, one has a different view.  Many issues have to be taken into account and the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, who has responsibility for planning in this area, is dealing directly with Senator Kelly.</P>

        <Quest>  if he intends issuing an instruction to ComReg, as he is empowered to do under the acts to lay down the minimum coverage requirements for any new mobile licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35823/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended.  ComReg is independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function.  In accordance with its statutory functions, ComReg has consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands and the auction has now commenced.</P>
        <P>I am advised that ComReg received a considerable number of responses to this consultation process.  These were considered prior to finalising the proposal for the award of a number of individual rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz radio spectrum bands.  The documents are ComReg Document 12/25 and Decision 04/12 published on 16 March 2012.   ComReg&rsquo;s information memorandum for this award process, which is now in the auction application phase, details the processes and procedures ComReg is employing to implement its substantive decisions.</P>
        <P>The reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its decisions on the minimum coverage and roll-out requirements are set out in section 5.5 of Document 12/25.  Among other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed the 70% population obligation by a considerable margin given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  It should be noted that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their current respective licences.  For example, for 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as 3, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is more than its obligation.</P>
        <P><i>Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>ComReg also notes that coverage continues to be an important competitive differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market.  Any deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.  The importance of maintaining the existing levels of mobile telephony and mobile broadband coverage has been raised with ComReg by my officials.  While the outcome of the forthcoming multi-band spectrum release process cannot be anticipated, I understand that ComReg is not expecting any reduction in coverage as a result of the process.   In all of the circumstances, I do not believe that a policy direction concerning this matter would be appropriate at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge what was in the Minister&rsquo;s reply in regard to the extent of the coverage.  To what extent has monitoring been done on the quality of coverage in the areas covered?  In some cases, there are dropped and missed calls, a lack of service and the signal is below 50%.  As a consequence, the consumer may not be getting good value for money.  Has any work by done by the regulator, or has the regulator pursued that particular angle?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there has.  As Deputy Durkan suggested, it is of varying quality.  There are still pockets where calls are dropped and so on, as he suggested.  However, immensely valuable quality spectrum is being released for the first time which will greatly enhance broadband and mobile services and it will make a considerable contribution to improving connectivity generally.  Obviously, there are areas of the country, whether for reasons of topography, distance from masts or whatever, where one still relies on a pretty basic service.  I hope to address that in a different area arising from the task force on next generation broadband which I chaired with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, and which comprised the chief executives of the leading telecommunications companies.  I hope that the national broadband plan, which we will publish as a result, will give Deputy Durkan some comfort in this area.  What we are talking about is not unique to Ireland, these difficulties obtain in most countries in the more difficult rural areas in particular, although not only in rural areas.  What is coming down the track will be a considerable improvement.</P>

	<P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access and associated fast speeds to every home and business in the State.</P>
        <P>The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT) report, which I launched on the second of May last, will have an important role to play in this regard.</P>
        <P>The report proposes 51 measures which could enable broadband infrastructure providers to accelerate and maximise commercial investment in new next generation broadband infrastructure.  The report also seeks to assist Government to identify regional gaps which may arise where the business case is insufficient to justify commercial investment.</P>
        <P>In launching the NGBT report I also commenced a public consultation to allow all other interested parties to comment on the document and to offer any additional or alternative proposals.  The public consultation closed in early June and more than 50 responses were received.  My Department has been considering the responses received and related matters.</P>
        <P>Building on the work of the Taskforce and the responses received, it is my intention to bring proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed services on a national basis which will take due account of the NGBT report and the additional responses received.</P>
        <P>The resources required to achieve the Government target cannot be quantified accurately at this time.  The amount of funding required will depend on a number of high level factors, including the actual build rate of broadband infrastructure on a commercial basis and the level of funding the commercial sector will contribute to any market intervention to ensure high speed broadband is available in areas the market will not serve on a commercial basis.</P>

        <Quest> the outcomes of the electric vehicle grant scheme that was introduced in 2009; if the target of achieving 6,000 passenger vehicles in operation by 2012 will be achieved; the percentage of the national car fleet that is powered by electricity; the amount the scheme has cost since its introduction; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires Member states to meet a target of 10% of renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The Government intends to meet the obligation through progressively increasing biofuel penetration and an ambition that 10% of all vehicles will be powered by electricity by 2020.</P>
        <P>Though very challenging, I believe that this target can be achieved.  Uptake over the next decade will be dependent on a range of factors including economic recovery, the price and range of electric vehicles progressively brought to market by manufacturers, the price of diesel and petroleum and overall consumer confidence. In addition, take-up in the technology will critically depend on global development in electric vehicle technology.  The pace of that development was demonstrably evident at the E-Motion Conference hosted by ESB and which I launched last week.  The level of international participation and interest was very high and a clear sign of the world wide trend.</P>
        <P>Electric vehicles are still at the early stages of development.  Government alone cannot ensure the development of the sector.  It requires a coalition of partners and stakeholders from Government, energy, automotive, ICT industry and academia.</P>
        <P>As part of encouraging market development I launched the electric vehicle grant scheme in 2011.  The scheme is designed to incentivise and support, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the early deployment of electric and other low emission vehicles.  The aim is to develop critical mass of such vehicles early on and build a stable market.</P>
        <P>Electric vehicles in Ireland also benefit from relief from vehicle registration tax, accelerated capital allowances and the lowest road tax rate.</P>
        <P>The grant scheme has a funding allocation of &euro;1.5 million this year.  To date, 97 grants totalling &euro;456,000 have been made by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the scheme.  This take up is broadly in line with experience in other EU Member States operating similar incentives.</P>
        <P>SEAI expects that the take up will increase as car manufacturers steadily expand the range of electric vehicles available to the market, as prices come down and as confidence increases in the availability of infrastructure.  There are approximately 300 electric vehicles in the country at this point.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be an early mover in the electrification of transport has been endorsed by the International Energy Agency in its Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Policy published on 11 July.</P>

	<P>The International Energy Agency&rsquo;s (IEA) Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Policy was launched and published on the 11th   July 2012.  The IEA reviews the energy policy of every member country every five years and last reviewed Ireland in 2007.  The 2012 Review is a comprehensive analysis and critique of Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy directions.  The Review incorporates the independent assessment of the electricity and gas sectors which was required under the EU-IMF-ECB memorandum of understanding in the programme of financial support for Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the context of the progress already made to enhance the gas and electricity markets, it is helpful to have the IEA&rsquo;s general endorsement of work to date including market reform, price deregulation and competition.  The Review underlines the need to enhance the powers of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) as necessary and also advocates that the competitive landscape be kept under review.  The Review reinforces the need to implement the third energy package and highlights the challenges for the island of Ireland associated with the integration of regional energy markets.  The Review calls for cost-effective and efficient expenditure on Ireland&rsquo;s energy networks and other major energy infrastructure underpinned by comprehensive consultation.</P>
        <P>In that context, I can advise the House that the Government has agreed a Policy Statement on the Strategic and Economic importance of Transmission and other Energy Infrastructure.  The Statement is being disseminated at national and local level to all Stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The Government Statement reaffirms the imperative need for development and renewal of our energy networks, in order to meet both economic and social policy goals. The planning process provides the necessary framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that comprehensive statutory and non-statutory consultation is built into the process.</P>
        <P>The Statement also acknowledges the need for social acceptance and the appropriateness of exploring ways of building community gain considerations into project planning and budgeting. Delivering long lasting benefits to communities is an important way of achieving public acceptability for infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The State network companies are mandated to plan their developments in a safe efficient and economic manner. They are also required to address and mitigate human, environmental and landscape impacts, in delivering the best possible engineering solutions.</P>
        <P>The major investment underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system under EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 Programme is the most important such investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations.</P>
        <P>While the Government does not seek to direct infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies, the Government endorses, supports and promotes the strategic programmes of the strategic energy infrastructure providers, particularly EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 key developments investment programme across the regions.  It is Government policy and in the national interest, not least in the current economic circumstances, that these investment programmes are delivered in the most cost efficient and timely way possible, on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and the costs of different engineering solutions.</P>

	<P>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of ensuring that 16% of all energy consumption is to be from renewable sources by 2020.  This target has to be achieved across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  </P>
        <P>This target, like all targets assigned to other Member States is challenging and the Government&rsquo;s priority is to meet these 2020 targets in the most cost effective and economically sustainable manner possible.</P>
        <P>To achieve this overall 16% target, Ireland, as set out in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan, intends to achieve  40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector, which together make up the requisite 16%.</P>
        <P>According to the provisional figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), at the end of 2011, 6.5% of all energy consumed in Ireland was from renewable sources, up from 3.1% in 2005.</P>
        <P>In terms of 2011, 17.6% of electricity consumed is provisionally estimated to be from renewable sources, with 40% required by 2020; 3.6% of transport energy was from renewables, with 10% required by 2020; and 5% of our heat energy was from renewables with 12% required by 2020.</P>
        <P>While good progress has been made, the challenges in achieving the significant increase required in the next 8 years are not to be underestimated.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s latest data indicates that at the end of 2011, Ireland had about 1900MW of renewable generation on the grid.  The latest modelling undertaken by SEAI indicates that, provided we achieve our energy efficiency targets, capacity of around 4000MW of renewable generation will be required on the system to deliver the 40% renewable electricity target by 2020.</P>
        <P>Through its DS3 programme, EirGrid is working to deliver the necessary operational changes to the grid to ensure that system security and stability are maintained while catering for significantly increased amounts of intermittent renewable generation.</P>
        <P>In addition to meet the challenging domestic renewable energy targets, Ireland is exploring with the UK the possibility of renewable trade under the framework of the cooperation mechanisms provided for in the Renewable Energy Directive.  This could lead to significant exports of wind electricity to the UK in the future.  I recently met Minister Hendry as part of a series of bilateral meetings on developing a formal Memorandum of Understanding by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>SEAI has estimated that the increase in electricity generation from renewable sources has displaced fossil fuel imports resulted in primary energy avoided by 6,613 Gigawatt hours in 2006 to 12,431 Gigawatt hours in 2011. SEAI has estimated that this has saved &euro;968 million in avoided fossil fuels imports over the past five years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 17 to 20, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputies will appreciate An Post is a Commercial State body with its own Board and Management.</P>
        <P>Operational matters and the sustainability of the post office network are a matter for the Management and Board of An Post.  These are areas in which I have no statutory function.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis.  In this context, the Government supports the maintenance of the maximum number of economically viable post offices.</P>
        <P>As shareholder I do have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard. The reality is that the core mail business has suffered a major fall and this has impacted seriously on the Company&rsquo;s revenue flow.  In response the Company is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business.</P>
        <P>An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</P>
        <P>This strategy is bearing fruit with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and I fully support the Company&rsquo;s strategy in this regard and its recent heads of agreement with Aviva.</P>
        <P>I recently met with the Irish Postmasters Union who presented me with a copy of the Grant Thornton report, The future of the Post Office Network in Ireland, which focuses on growing the business to make the network more sustainable.  I have read and considered this report and found it both positive and ambitious.</P>
        <P>In the context of the public sector reform and service delivery agenda, I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other Ministers in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies.  I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</P>

        <Quest> the average broadband speeds available to residential and business customers in towns of less than 10,000 persons and in the open countryside; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Statistics on broadband availability in Ireland, in the format requested by the Deputy, are not available.</P>
        <P>Statutory authority to require statistical information from individual service providers, operating in the fully liberalised telecommunications market, is vested in the independent market regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>ComReg, publishes quarterly statistical reports which include information on market developments in contracted broadband speeds in an aggregated and anonymous form at the national level.  I have no statutory basis to request the more detailed statistical returns submitted by individual service providers which could include commercially sensitive information.  My Department can only access the information published by ComReg.</P>
        <P>The ComReg published quarterly statistical reports, can be accessed on its website <i>www.comreg.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I can however advise the Deputy of the position as advised by industry in the Report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce Report.  That report states that 35% of the population (600,000 households) already have access to speeds of 100Mbps via cable.  From 2015 over 50% of the population (900,000 households) will have access to speeds of 70Mpbs and above, with 41% having access to speeds of 100Mpbs via cable.  Fixed wireless services of 30Mbps are currently available to 500,000 homes, including approximately 80,000 outside of the cable footprint.  In the areas not served by cable, consumers generally have access to headline speeds of between 3Mpbs and 24Mbps (depending on the area) through fixed line, mobile and satellite services, with fixed wireless providing higher speeds in some areas.</P>
        <P>Larger commercial customers generally have access to the high speeds they require and the Taskforce did not identify this as an area of particular concern.  Affordable access to higher speeds may however be problematic for smaller businesses and companies who wish to provide eWorking facilities for employees.</P>
        <P>The most recent report published by ComReg is for the quarter to the end March 2012.  It reports that the number of customers contracting for broadband service is continuing to increase year on year, increasing from 1.64 million in Q1 2011 to more than 1.66 million.</P>
        <P>It also reports that customers are moving from lower to higher broadband speeds.  The proportion of customers contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or less has fallen to less than 6% from 14% in Q1 2010; the proportion of customers contracted in a range between 2 Mbps and 10 Mbps was 75% at end Q1 2012 and the proportion of customers contracted at speed exceeding 10 Mbps increased from 7% in Q1 2010 to 19% at the end of Q1 2012. In addition to its published statistical reports, ComReg also operates a customer Information service, accessible at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>, which allows users to identify marketed broadband services by county and also allows users to compare the costs of home phone, broadband, mobile and combined packages.  However, this facility identifies marketed broadband speeds at the county level only and would not facilitate the collection of data in the form requested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Collective energy bargaining is an innovative practice being looked at by a number of Governments and communities within Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Netherlands amongst others.  The premise is that the community or group can purchase fuel at a more competitive rate than that available to individuals, thus reducing expenditure on fuel for participants.</P>
<P>The concept is particularly interesting in the context of the Affordable Energy Strategy and the work of the Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE).  One of the priority actions in the Strategy is to look at the role of energy suppliers and identify opportunities for relieving the fuel price burden on consumers.  Three actions have been specifically identified for further consideration including energy brokering, oil stamps and pay as you go for oil.  The IDGAE will keep developments in other jurisdictions under close review as the work of the group develops.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Passports Act 2008 states that the Minister shall, before issuing a passport to a child, be satisfied on reasonable grounds that each person who is a guardian of the child consents to the issue of a passport to the child.  Section 6 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that married parents of a child are joint-guardians. Therefore if both are alive they are both required to give consent for the issuance of a passport to a minor.    In the case where a guardian of the child is deceased it does not necessarily follow that the remaining guardian is now the sole guardian. For instance a guardian can also, in a will or deed, appoint someone else to be a testamentary guardian after he or she dies.  For this reason the surviving parent must sign and complete an affidavit stating that no other person is a guardian by operation of law, that a person has not been appointed by any other way and that there are no other circumstances by which a guardian has been appointed.  </P>

	<P>In March 2011 the British Government, acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, initiated proceedings with the US Department of Justice under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries for the release of archived interviews held in Boston College. The archives are part of the <i>Belfast Project,</i> an oral history of Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries compiled by Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Moloney and deposited in the Burns Library at the College.  Legal challenges were launched by Boston College, and separately by Mr. MacIntyre and Mr. Moloney, to prevent the release of the material.  In December 2011, these challenges were dismissed by US District Court Judge William Young<i>. </i>  Further legal efforts by Mr. MacIntyre and Mr. Moloney were made but on 6 July, the US Federal Court of Appeal turned down their appeal. </P>
        <P>The court ruling means that the archived material must be handed over by Boston College to the US authorities for onward transmission to their British counterparts.   However Mr. Moloney and Mr. McIntyre are considering a motion for a re-hearing of the case.  They also continue to keep their legal options open in the Belfast Courts.</P>
        <P>A number of factors inform the Government&rsquo;s views on this matter.  The issue is subject to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the US and British governments.  The issue also has a bearing on how we deal with the past generally. We need to find sensitive ways of dealing with the past that meet the needs of victims and the bereaved.</P>
        <P>Clearly the case is a matter that the Courts in the United States have spoken on and may do so again, as may the Courts in Northern Ireland.  Officials of my Department will continue to closely monitor any further developments.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is strongly focused on the fight against poverty and hunger and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  The fifth of these Goals focuses on reducing maternal mortality and achieving universal access to reproductive health, including ante-natal care and family planning services. Ireland has a strong track record of support for the provision of family planning services for women in developing countries, through our funding and policy work with global initiatives and our engagement at country level through government health sectors. Irish Aid also provides support for the complementary work of NGOs to increase access to family planning services. </P>
        <P>We believe that investing in health, including sexual and reproductive health, and in education for women and girls is fundamental to managing the challenges posed by a rapidly expanding world population.  Reflecting this priority, in 2010 Ireland provided a total of some &euro;145 million in funding for the health and education sectors in our nine priority countries and through global level partnerships. Since 2006, Ireland has provided almost &euro;30 million in support of the UN Population Fund&rsquo;s reproductive, maternal health and family planning programmes. Irish Aid provides funding for family planning services in a wide range of developing countries, including, Bolivia, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lesotho, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is strongly focused on sub-Saharan Africa, where the challenge of population growth is acute.  In Ethiopia, for instance, our support for the Health Extension Programme has seen impressive growth in the uptake of contraception in rural areas.  In both Tanzania and Mozambique, Irish support for the health sector has contributed to better delivery of district level reproductive health care. In Lesotho, in partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, we have contributed to improved access to family planning by women living in very remote mountain villages.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid will continue to support organisations that are focused on reducing maternal mortality and promoting universal access to reproductive health, including ante-natal care and family planning services.</P>

Following consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies, the Joint Secretariat of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) wrote to Clones Town Council in November 2011 to explain that it was not in a position to arrange a meeting as requested.

	<P>The focus for the remainder of our OSCE Chairmanship will be on the preparations for the Dublin Ministerial Council, to take place from 6-7 December. We are taking forward the priorities which I have previously outlined to this House, ensuring balance and coherence across all three dimensions of the OSCE&rsquo;s work. Our aim for the Dublin Ministerial Council is to achieve concrete results, through a small and balanced package of decisions and declarations for adoption at the Council. We will be reflecting in the coming months on which areas may be appropriate for consideration by the Ministerial Council and we will be negotiating with partners in the run-up to the Council.   As Chair-in-Office, we are continuing efforts to make progress towards lasting settlements of a number of conflicts in the OSCE area. Among these is the conflict in Moldova regarding the territory of Transdniestria; the conflict in Georgia regarding the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; and the conflict which is the subject of the Minsk process. I am assisted in this task by Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute;, who is my Special Representative for the Transdniestrian settlement process, and by P&aacute;draig Murphy, my Special Representative for the Southern Caucasus.  They are cooperating with international actors on the ground as well as maintaining close contact with the parties. </P>
        <P>I am pleased that progress has recently been achieved in the so-called &lsquo;5+2&rsquo; Talks, chaired by Ireland, on the Transdniestria settlement process and as part of our support for this process, Moldovan and Transdniestrian negotiators visited Dublin and Belfast in May on a study visit to learn more about the Northern Ireland peace process. We remain committed to providing detailed briefings on aspects of the Northern Ireland peace process, should this be helpful to those engaged in conflict resolution efforts in the OSCE area. In mid-June it was my privilege to visit all three countries in the South Caucasus region. I had useful discussions in each of the three and was able, in talks with political leaders, to get a first hand impression of the situation in the region. I urged all concerned to engage constructively in discussions aimed at finding solutions to these conflicts.</P>
        <P>The Irish Chairmanship is actively taking forward Mongolia&rsquo;s application to become an OSCE participating State and we have been active in work, at diplomatic level, on issues related to the legal status of the OSCE.  As the fortieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act beckons in 2015, we launched the &lsquo;Helsinki + 40 concept&rsquo;, in consultation with the OSCE Troika and the future Swiss and Serbian Chairmanships. This offers an important opportunity to adopt a more forward-looking and strategic approach for the OSCE, moving towards realisation of the common vision agreed at the Astana Summit in 2010, that is to say, a comprehensive, cooperative and indivisible security community throughout the OSCE area.</P>
        <P>I will, of course, keep this House informed on developments relating to our OSCE Chairmanship.</P>

	<P>The humanitarian situation in Syria has deteriorated rapidly in the past number of months. Estimates of those affected by the violence range from 1.5 to 3 million, with the lack of precise data indicative of the challenging situation on the ground for both humanitarian actors and the media.  In the year since the current crisis began in March 2011, more than 11,000 deaths have been reported.  Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has registered and assisted more than 110,000 refugees in neighbouring countries.  With the situation worsening in many areas, the refugee population has increased by 10,000 in the last two weeks alone. Moreover, pre-existing vulnerabilities amongst the 100,000 Iraqi and 500,000 Palestinian refugees living in Syria are being exacerbated as a result of the ongoing unrest.  Food prices have tripled in some areas raising the risk of malnutrition, undermining livelihoods and increasing tensions between displaced and host communities. </P>
        <P>Given the increasingly difficult situation on the ground, EU Member States, including Ireland have been mobilising substantial funding to help aid agencies respond to the crisis.  In this regard, the T&aacute;naiste approved &euro;500,000 in emergency funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP).  These funds are being used to provide both immediate relief within Syria and help to those forced to flee to neighbouring countries.</P>
        <P>We remain particularly worried by the ongoing restrictions on humanitarian access and have therefore been insisting on the full implementation of Kofi Annan&rsquo;s six-point peace plan. Ireland continues to engage at an international level to help find a sustainable solution to the crisis, especially to find ways to assist those Syrians most affected by the unrest. Towards this end, we have participated at a high political level in the meetings of the &lsquo;Friends of Syria&rsquo; , with the T&aacute;naiste attending the conference in Tunis in February as well as the follow-up meeting held earlier this month in Paris.  Ireland has also been actively involved in both UN and EU discussions on humanitarian access and the needs on the ground, including in the context of the  meetings of the &lsquo;Humanitarian Forum on Syria&rsquo; in Geneva.</P>
        <P>Finally, we are also working closely with our humanitarian partners across the region in order to identify other potential areas of support.  We will continue to explore suitable options which would help to meet the priority humanitarian needs of the Syrian population, both inside the country and at its borders.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, channels a significant proportion of funding through development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).  This reflects the strong contribution which Irish NGOs are making to the fight against world poverty and hunger, and the broad support which they continue to receive from the Irish public.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid places a strong emphasis on corporate governance and financial oversight in its relationships with the development NGOs.  Its grant approval process is strongly focused on the achievement of key development results.  The process encompasses an assessment of corporate governance and financial oversight issues, including the level of oversight by the Board of Directors of each organisation&rsquo;s strategic direction, financial sustainability, risk management, accountability and transparency.  Corporate governance issues are monitored regularly and, where necessary, performance benchmarks are put in place to improve standards and ensure accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>The Charities Act 2009 governs the regulation and oversight of charities in Ireland.  It provides for the establishment of a register of charities and the creation of a new Charities Regulatory Authority to ensure greater accountability and increased transparency in the charity sector.</P>
        <P>While a number of sections of the Act have been commenced, the Charities Regulatory Authority has not yet been established.  However, in relation to the development sector, Irish Aid has provided funding to the association of Irish non-governmental development organisations, D&oacute;chas, to develop a Code of Corporate Governance, in partnership with the Corporate Governance Association of Ireland.</P>
        <P>This Code sets out best practice principles, drawing from established codes in other countries.  They include standards in relation to board responsibilities, leadership, accountability, integrity and transparency.  I attach great importance to work to improve standards of corporate governance and strengthen NGO accountability.  Irish Aid is continuing to work with, and fund, D&oacute;chas to support ongoing work on enhancing professional standards for NGOs and to encourage and monitor compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The peace process and the Good Friday Agreement have resulted in a transformation of society in Northern Ireland, perhaps most visibly in the normalisation of daily life and the dramatic decrease in terrorist-related incidents and violence. There remains, however, a threat from paramilitary groups who continue to assert their determination to impose a return to conflict on the people of Ireland.   RAAD has claimed responsibility for the murder of one young man in Buncrana earlier this year and for a grim series of shootings and mutilations of young people in Derry. It is clear that these people enjoy no popular support within the community, as evidenced by the unequivocal response by the people of Derry who have publically protested against those who seek to impose their will on the community through violence.</P>
        <P>Strong deep cooperation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland is doing much to counter such individuals and groups. The number of arrests in connection with paramilitary activity made in both jurisdictions continues to be significant. The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI will continue to cooperate very closely to combat such activity on both sides of the border.</P>
        <P>Justice and security matters are not among the six Areas of Co-Operation on which common policies and approaches are discussed and agreed in the North South Ministerial Council.  It is however, a matter of close ongoing cooperation between the Government, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British authorities.  The Joint Statement by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron on British Irish relations in March this year underlined the determination of both governments to support reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I regularly review progress in this area with Secretary of State Owen Patterson and did so most recently yesterday.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together. </P>
        <P>Ireland, along with our EU partners, have consistently asserted that the long term solution to the Middle East conflict, and the only way to secure the needs and interests of Israelis, Palestinians and others in the region is a solution based on two states, including a sovereign Palestinian state, and thus the ending of the Israeli occupation. Successive Irish Governments have also consistently stated that settlements are illegal under international law and are an obstacle to peace. The relentless construction of settlements in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) is undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state. This is unambiguous EU policy, and a message that Ireland and our EU partners relay to the Israeli authorities in every meeting.  The settlement project is incompatible with a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and with the end of the occupation.</P>
        <P>Recognising that developments on the ground are threatening to make a two-state solution impossible, the Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted Conclusions that restated, and in many respects advanced, EU positions on issues such as the Palestinian depopulation of Area C and evictions and demolitions in East Jerusalem. The Conclusions set out the remedial action which we wish to see, primarily from Israel. Clearly the Council will have to continue to press on these issues.</P>
        <P>The occupation will only come to an end as a result of a negotiated settlement between the two sides.  It is in the interests of Israel, Palestinians, and the wider region, that a political compromise is found on the basis of a two-state solution. I would strongly encourage Israel to recognise that the window of opportunity for the two-state solution is rapidly closing, and that its own interests are best served by engaging meaningfully and genuinely in peace talks.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</askee>
        <Quest> if he will outline the position regarding an application for a passport in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Passports Act 2008 provides, among other things, that only Irish citizens are entitled to be issued with Irish passports.  Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.  The Passport Service received an application from the person in question in April, 2011.  At that stage, it could not be finalised until her entitlement to Irish citizenship was demonstrated.  </P>
        <P>As the applicant was born in Kilkenny on 26 December, 2010, her entitlement to Irish citizenship is subject to section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended (the Act).  This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years immediately preceding that person&rsquo;s birth.</P>
        <P>In line with guidelines provided by Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered by this Department for passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports and/or the registration cards/books. These are issued to persons registering their lawful presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). In addition, the Department will accept letters from GNIB that state the various permission details which have been issued to a person.  All of these are official documents/permits, which can be objectively verified by the Passport Service, if required.</P>
        <P>The initial evidence provided in the submitted application related to the mother&rsquo;s residence in the State.  This included an immigration stamp and a registration card, both of which were issued by GNIB.  In addition to this, a letter from GNIB dated 11 April, 2011, stated the full record of the mother&rsquo;s lawfully registered presence in the State.  This showed that she first registered with GNIB on 15 February, 2008. The period from that date to 25 December, 2010 was reckonable for the purposes of the Act.  However, it is less than the statutory requirement of three years. The child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship was, therefore, not demonstrated and as such her application for a passport could not be approved for passport issue.  The child&rsquo;s parents were advised of this by the Passport Service on 25 May, 2011.</P>
        <P>There has been further contact with the parents in the intervening period.  Last February, the child&rsquo;s mother provided additional information, in particular, a letter from the Department of Justice, dated 3 December, 2007 which granted permission to her to remain in the State.  This letter is important and may be relevant to the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  However, as it is outside the standard items of evidence of lawful residence in the State, as advised by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Passport Service has been in contact with that Department for direction on the acceptability of this letter as evidence of lawful residence.  Their clarification on this is pending.  In the meantime, this application will remain open.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the parents have the option of pursuing directly the matter of their daughter&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship with the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the event that they receive written confirmation that she is an Irish citizen under the Act, the Passport Service will be in a position to issue a passport.</P>

No other pay increases have been sought or awarded since the original appointments.  </P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing high-level services to the public both at home and abroad. These services include passports, consular assistance and a range of other citizenship and consular functions. My Department also provides non-consular services to Irish communities abroad including the Certificate of Irish Heritage project which is outsourced.    The Certificate of Irish Heritage is operated by Fexco, one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous outsourcing providers, under licence from my Department.  The service is funded solely by the fee paid by applicants and the Department has no ongoing funding commitment.   </P>

	<P>Excluding the exceptional costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE and preparations for our Presidency of the EU, the resources available to my Department for staff and other administrative costs are &euro;3.175 million less than the corresponding allocation for 2011.   While not all spending is evenly spread over the year, I anticipate at this stage that administrative outgoings will be in line with the annual budget provision.</P>

	<P>One official who retired from my Department on 29 February 2012 has been temporarily re-engaged in order to assist with the Department&rsquo;s activities in the lead-up to and during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU from January to June 2013.  The contract of employment in this case provides for attendance on a part-time basis from 1 May until 31 July 2012 and on a fulltime basis from 1 September 2012 until 30 June 2013 when it will be terminated.  This officer was re-engaged on a pension abatement basis which means in effect that he continues to receive his pension and is paid a correspondingly reduced salary by the Department. This temporary recruitment arrangement is in line with a Government Decision of 16 December 2011 relating to Presidency matters, including staffing arrangements.   The policy of my Department regarding the re-hiring of retired officials is to do so to the minimum extent possible.  However, for certain once-off or short-duration projects it is more productive and cost-effective to re-hire retired staff who already have the relevant expertise and experience than to go through a time-consuming and relatively expensive recruitment, induction and training process.  </P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, following the transfer of certain trade promotion functions to my Department last year, Enterprise Ireland proposals for trade missions are submitted simultaneously to both myself and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, reflecting the close involvement of both our Departments in trade-related matters. The Export Trade Council, which I chair, also considers the overall programme of trade missions in the context of our priority markets.  Trade missions are a valuable support to Irish business in developing markets abroad and are particularly important in the context of the export-led growth which is crucial to our economic recovery. As Chairman of the Export Trade Council I am working to ensure that we maximise the promotional opportunities generated by all Ministerial travel abroad whether on specific trade missions, such as those organised by Enterprise Ireland, or for other purposes.    For my own part, since becoming T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have sought to promote our economic and trading objectives whenever possible whether at targeted events organised by Enterprise Ireland or in the course of broader working visits abroad.  My colleagues Ministers Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and Joe Costello have done the same in their role as Trade Ministers since March 2011.</P>
        <P>In June of this year I travelled to London for Enterprise Ireland trade events, including a Green Economy dinner and a business breakfast hosted in our Embassy. In March, I had travelled to Canada for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day where my visit provided the opportunity to meet with political and business leaders and take part in a range of trade and investment promotion events organised in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.</P>
        <P>I visited Russia in November 2011 where I co-chaired a meeting of the Joint Economic Commission with Russia and signed an agreement on a programme for trade and economic cooperation between Ireland and Russia. I visited Japan and Korea in October 2011 and there was a strong economic dimension to my working programmes there, including through my participation in the Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum in Seoul.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am undertaking a programme of travel related to Ireland&rsquo;s Chairmanship of the OSCE and, whenever possible, I have used these overseas visits to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and promote our economic interests. I also hope to visit China later this year with a strong focus on economic and trading issues.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello TD, has led Enterprise Ireland trade missions to Turkey and Russia in March and June of this year respectively. He also intends to lead Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s trade missions to Brazil in October and to South Africa in November and to also host an Enterprise Ireland trade event in Rome in the autumn. Prior to Minister Costello&rsquo;s appointment, his predecessor, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan TD, led a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and Qatar in October 2011 and to South Africa in November 2011.  All of these trade missions featured very close co-operation between my Department, our Embassies and Enterprise Ireland.</P>

The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 contains a commitment, to be completed this year, to &ldquo;assess the Credit Review Office to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require.&rdquo;  The SME Credit Consultation Committee, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, provides a forum where stakeholders can communicate and interact regarding difficulties in relation to SME credit with a view to proactively solving them. The next meeting of the Committee is due to take place on 24 July and one of the items on the agenda is the terms of reference for the assessment of the CRO. It is anticipated that when the terms of reference are finalised, my Department will engage consultants to carry out the task and produce a report which will be circulated to the Committee for discussion.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the company in question applied for outline approval to raise investments under the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) on 30 November 2006. As required, a certificate from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, dated 23 November 2006, approving the company&rsquo;s three year Development and Marketing Plan was submitted with the application. A letter from the Revenue Commissioners granting outline approval was issued on 14 December 2006. The company did not subsequently make a claim under the BES.</P>
        <P>If the company now intends to raise funding under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII), which has replaced the BES from 25 November 2011, it must submit a new certificate from F&aacute;ilte Ireland approving the company&rsquo;s current Development and Marketing Plan to the Revenue Commissioners, together with an application under the EII.  EII is a new incentive, different from BES. Certification by F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the sole external certification requirement retained in EII.  The requirement under EII for a new certificate is appropriate more than five years after the original certificate was issued by reference to a three-year marketing plan and five-year financial projections, each of which now relates to past years.</P>

	<P>Relief for certain income from long-term leasing of agricultural land is currently provided for under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The exemptions are available to all landowners over 40, or those who are permanently incapacitated from carrying on farming, who lease agricultural land.  Under the current provisions there is an exemption from income tax in respect of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The first &euro;12,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than 5 years;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The first &euro;15,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than 7 years, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The first &euro;20,000 where the leasing is for 10 years or more.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The aim of the scheme is to provide the lessee with a greater degree of security thus encouraging the proper maintenance and development of the land.  Longer term leases enable those who rent the land to make better long term investment and planning decisions.  The measure is intended to facilitate the more productive use of the land.  As the Deputy states it assists in improving land mobility and addressing the shortage of land available for young progressive farmers.  Like all tax or expenditure measures the land leasing exemption will fall to be considered in the context of the ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy.  It should be noted that, in common with other such schemes, any changes to the land leasing exemption would be subject to EU State aid approval.</P>

	<P>In September 2011 the Government announced the establishment of the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA) within the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  NewERA will centralise the management of Government holdings in the commercial semi-state sector (initially the companies within NewERA&rsquo;s remit are ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte) from a shareholder perspective. This role, based on the Shareholder Executive model already established in a number of developed economies, will involve oversight of activities such as capital expenditure plans, corporate strategy, acquisitions and disposals. NewERA is already working closely with the relevant Government departments and companies in this regard. The Shareholder Executive approach is designed to provide the Government with a portfolio view of investment returns from the sector and with a means of assessing the likely impact of commercial developments in the sector on long-term Government investment plans.</P>
        <P>NewERA is also charged with assisting the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in<b> </b>energy, water and next-generation<b> </b>telecommunications with the long-term objective of employment creation and has commenced work with the relevant Government departments in these areas.  NewERA is an important element in the Government&rsquo;s strategy to promote economic growth and create jobs.  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency in preparing proposals for legislation to put NewERA on a statutory footing and I expect to bring forward those proposals as soon as possible once that work is completed.</P>

However, as this funding is being provided in the first instance by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the relevant pricing policies will apply.  Spain, in common with other countries in receipt of EFSF funding, will pay the rate determined by the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funding, which is defined in the EFSF Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>&ldquo;...the effective (after hedging) average cost of funding incurred by EFSF in funding such Financial Assistance as determined by EFSF and allocated to the relevant Financial Assistance pursuant to the Diversified Funding Strategy. The EFSF Cost of Funding shall be calculated by EFSF by adding (i) EFSF&rsquo;s (after hedging) average cost of funding the relevant Financial Assistance, expressed as a rate per annum; for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of discount Funding Instruments (e.g. zero-coupon notes), cost of funding shall be calculated with reference to the nominal value of the relevant discount Funding Instrument, (ii) the annual Service Fee (with effect from the first anniversary of the Disbursement Date of the relevant Financial Assistance), (iii) the Commitment Fee (iv) any Guarantee Commission Fee accrued during the relevant period and (v) any other financing costs, margin, negative carry, losses, hedging costs or other costs, fees or expenses.&rdquo;</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Subject to the final decision on the price of Spain&rsquo;s EFSF funding, there is no reason to believe that the cost of EFSF funds for Spain will be any more favourable than that now available for Ireland.</P>

	<P>Following the publication of the Personal Insolvency Bill and the associated media briefing on 29 June, officials from the Department of Justice and Equality (which has primary functional responsibility for policy on insolvency), together with officials from my Department, provided a briefing session on the Bill to a number organisations that have a significant interest in this policy area.  Among the organisations that attended this session, which was held prior to the briefing provided by officials to members of the Oireachtas also on 29 June, was a representative of the Irish Banking Federation.  As many of the people that attended this briefing session were present in a representative capacity, it would not be appropriate for me to name individuals.  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Economic Management Council met with the main banks on 26 June 2012 to brief them on the Government&rsquo;s mortgage arrears strategy and to discuss with them their approach to help resolve this significant problem.</P>

NAMA recently reaffirmed its expectation that the Agency will recoup for the taxpayer the Senior Bonds in issue as well as recovery of its carrying costs and the working and development capital advanced to debtors in the course of its business.   NAMA&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2011, which will be published this month, will make extensive information available on the Agency&rsquo;s operations and will chart the substantial progress that NAMA has made towards achieving its core financial objective.  NAMA has also, as the Deputy is aware, announced a significant programme of asset development and enhancement in Ireland over the period to 2016 and the availability of &euro;2 billion in vendor finance for prospective purchasers of commercial properties controlled by its debtors and receivers.  A number of other initiatives are being progressed by the Agency.  These activities provide strong evidence of the measures being adopted by NAMA to ensure that it will meet its objectives under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  NAMA&rsquo;s position is not under discussion in the context of the State&rsquo;s current discussions on bank debt.</P>

	<P>As at 31 December 2011, and as outlined in Note 22 to the 2011 annual report and accounts of Irish Life and Permanent, there was &euro;2.7 billion of lending from banks and institutions outstanding. This lending was by way of a collateralised repurchase agreement secured on &euro;5 billion of notes issued by SPVs which hold residential mortgages.  During 2013 there are a variety of debt securities which comprise the &euro;2,775 million stated in Note 24 to the 2011 annual report and accounts, the largest of which are a &euro;1.4 billion guaranteed maturity in January 2013 and a &euro;1.2 billion guaranteed maturity in April 2013.

	<P>As you will be aware as part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Financial Measures Programme the three PLAR banks are required to deleverage &euro;70bn of assets by 31 December 2013. Of this they are required to actively dispose of &euro;34bn of assets. IBRC is subject to an EC Restructuring Plan which requires it to work out its balance sheet over time, including where possible via disposal of loan books.  To this end, Non-core teams have been established by each of the banks to focus on managing sales processes. In most instances the Banks have also employed expert professional sales advisors to assist in ensuring that the sales process undertaken maximises sales proceeds. Deleveraging committees are also in place at each bank. These are attended by executive and non-executive Directors, with representatives from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, who attend as observers.</P>
        <P>To date significant progress has been made. Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was &euro;46bn as at 31 December 2011. Deleveraging has been achieved within planned assumed discounts. From a capital perspective, the loss incurred on the divestment of these assets is broadly offset by a reduction in the level of risk weighted assets.</P>
        <P>It is normal course of practice that sales processes are conducted under appropriate confidentiality constraints, including for example non-disclosure agreements to protect price sensitive information, the disclosure of which could prevent the banks from maximising proceeds on sale. In this regard, it would not be advantageous to disclose the exact details of the remaining non-core books that are targeted for disposal or details of the sales and marketing activities given the dissipation in value that could occur. At certain points the banks will publish deleveraging plan updates as part of their investor and stakeholder relations activities.</P>

	<P>Firstly, I would like to apologise to the Deputy for the delay in replying to previous correspondence requesting that consideration be given to introducing some type of tax allowance to alleviate the cost for parents who are sending children to study in Dublin.  The Government acknowledges the continuing financial pressures on parents and students and is therefore continuing to make significant investment in third level education.</P>
        <P>In general, there are no tuition fees payable at undergraduate level apart from the student contribution.  There is also a system of means-tested maintenance supports for students of limited incomes, with higher rates of support applying for those attending courses in colleges which are more than 45 kilometers from their normal residence.  Where tuition fees are payable in respect of certain full-time and part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses in approved colleges, tax relief is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual.  The current maximum amount of fees that can be tax relieved is &euro;7,000 per course per academic year, subject to certain conditions.   The introduction of further tax reliefs along the lines sought by the Deputy could not be justified given the current budgetary position.</P>

Its report in 2012 made recommendations in relation to the development of policy to deal with a wide range of key issues relating to the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol &mdash; including the question of a minimum price for alcohol &mdash; along with measures for the policy areas of prevention strategies, treatment, rehabilitation and substance dependency, research and information. Those issues are being dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Ms Roisin Shortall.  The Deputy may be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s alcohol tax levels are already high in relation to other EU Member States. At July 2012, we had the highest excise duty within the EU 27 for sparkling wine, the third-highest for still wine and spirits and the fourth-highest for beer.</P>

        <Quest> if he or the Central Bank of Ireland has received proposals for branch closures from the covered institutions; if he will provide a breakdown of the number of closures proposed for each covered institution; his views on these proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated previously, the Deputy will appreciate that it is an inevitable, but unfortunate, consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system that job losses will arise [and branches will be closed]. Essentially the banks will be smaller operations than previously. The Central Bank of Ireland cannot disclose this type of confidential information under Section 33ak (1)(b)(i) of the Central Bank Act 2003.</P>
        <P>As you know, operational decisions remain the responsibility of the boards and managements of the institutions. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the covered institutions, I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF and the Relationship Frameworks which define the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at; <i>http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/</i>.</P>
        <P>However, the individual banks have supplied me with the following:</P>
        <P><i>PTSB:</i></P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring plan and in order to achieve viability PTSB will announce a restructuring, including branch closures, shortly. The Department of Finance will review the plans with PTSB in the immediate future. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate to comment further in advance of staff consultation on the matter.</P>
        <P><i>BOI:</i></P>
        <P>The Minister has not received proposals for branch closures from Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P><i>AIB:</i></P>
        <P>As part of a strategic plan to improve viability, AIB is currently in the process of repositioning its physical branch network. This will inevitably involve a reduction in the number of branches across the country as the Bank targets cost savings. AIB is expected to form a closer relationship with An Post, to compensate for the loss of customer access to branches. I am informed that AIB is working to finalise its branch closure plans, with an announcement likely in the near term.</P>
        <P><i>IBRC:</i></P>
        <P>IBRC has actively reduced the number of properties being used by the Bank for its day to day operations. The Bank closed offices in Newcastle (UK) and Chicago (USA) in 2010, in Banbury (UK), D&uuml;sseldorf, Edinburgh, Jersey, Leeds and Vienna in 2011 and Wigmore Street, London and New York in 2012. The offices of the former Anglo Irish Bank and the former INBS in the Isle of Man were also disposed of in 2011 as part of the Banks&rsquo; deposit transfers which took place on 25 February 2011.  In addition, IBRC also put the entire former INBS branch network up for sale in October 2011. This portfolio, comprising a total of 49 branches is in the process of being sold and good progress is being made.  As IBRC is a Bank in work out, the ongoing premises requirements of the organisation will continue to decrease over time.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The licensing year runs from the 1st October to the 30th September. Therefore as the figures quoted below relate to the calendar year, it is occasionally possible for an individual licence to be reflected twice.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Off licences are issued either singularly such as &ldquo;Wine Retailer&rsquo;s Off Licence&rdquo; or in combinations such as Spirits and/or beer, and/or wine. Off licences can also be issued in combination with Wholesale Dealer licences. Therefore, the figures below reflect the actual number of each category of licence issued and cannot be taken to reflect either numbers of licensees or premises.</P>

The inspection was carried out in order to determine compliance with the provisions of the 2006 Consumer Protection Code, now revised since 1 January 2012. As a result of the inspection, the Central Bank is requiring the seven firms inspected to conduct a comprehensive review of all of their PPI sales from August 2007 to date. The firms are requested to respond to the Central Bank by 17 August 2012. Copy of the Press Release dated 2 July 2012 and a copy of the letter issued to the firms concerned are available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website: <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.    As I have indicated in a replies to recent  Parliamentary Questions on this subject, the Financial Services Ombudsman has advised me that, since 1 January 2007,  his Office has received the following number of complaints from consumers in relation to mortgage protection insurance policies:</P>

	<P>The latest date by which payment of the temporary levy on funded pension schemes and personal pension plans introduced in 2011 to fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> must be made is 25 September each year. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from the levy to date in 2012 is &euro;6.5 million.  As in 2011 I anticipate that the majority of payments will be made in the run-up to the payment date. The Government introduced the temporary levy on funded pension schemes and personal pension plans in order to fund the measures introduced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>. These included a new second reduced VAT rate of 9% aimed primarily at the tourism sector, a halving of the employers PRSI rate until 2013, as well as small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure aimed primarily at &lsquo;shovel-ready&rsquo; projects and increasing the number of available educational, training and up-skilling places.</P>

	<P>Last October the Government published the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (&ldquo;Keane Report&rdquo;) and the implementation of its recommendations is now a significant part of the Government&rsquo;s overall efforts to tackle mortgage difficulty.  As announced recently, a number of significant milestones have now been achieved in the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  These are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defense has published the Personal Insolvency Bill which is now before the Oireachtas;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Finally, a specific website &mdash; keepingyourhome.ie &mdash; has been put in place by the Citizens Information Board, which will very shortly be enhanced by a telephone helpline, to provide information to mortgage holders.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The further development and roll out of these measures will considerably enhance the supports available to distressed mortgage holders.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue to work intensively on all these areas to further advance the various measures during the second half of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>There has been speculation for some time now about the extent of the European Central Bank&rsquo;s (ECB) purchases of sovereign debt on the secondary markets.  The Central Bank of Ireland maintains the register of holders of Irish Government bonds.  As I outlined to the Deputy in response to a similar question back in February, I am informed by the Central Bank that the ECB does not disclose its holdings of sovereign debt and therefore it is not possible to supply the information requested by the Deputy.  As regards the income the ECB earns from securities purchased under the Securities Market Programme (SMP) the ECB distributes profits from securities purchased under the SMP to National Central Banks in the form of an interim distribution of profit.  The Governing Council of the ECB may decide to retain all or part of that income, in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>Of course, and as the Deputy will be aware, preliminary discussions which could have a positive effect on the Irish debt situation are underway. This follows on from the end-June euro area summit where it was agreed that the situation of the Irish financial sector would be examined with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment Programme. This is a positive development for Ireland.   However, it is important not to prejudice the outcome of these negotiations by commenting on the likely contents of any agreement at this time. I can assure the Deputy that we will seek to be ambitious in the negotiations and will seek to agree the best deal possible for the Irish taxpayer.</P>

	<P>I have been advised that confidential and legally privileged reports in relation to Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) have been provided to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) as the relevant regulatory authority for a building society.  This information was relayed to the Garda&iacute;. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement regulates and enforces the Companies Acts and therefore, given that the reports relate to a building society which was not subject to the Companies Acts, the reports were not furnished to the ODCE. I have also been advised that the CBI is continuing their ongoing investigation into INBS and IBRC is cooperating fully with that investigation and has put significant resources in place to do so.</P>

The NTMA made performance-related payments to five key staff in respect of 2011. These payments in aggregate totalled &euro;62,610. This compares with payments totalling &euro;1,981,760 to 258 staff members in respect of 2010.</P>

	<P>Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies. The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person subject to self-assessment or a company.  For PAYE-only taxpayers, the relief is given on a &ldquo;grossed-up&rdquo; basis to the approved body rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. The claim is therefore made to the Revenue Commissioners by the approved body. In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement. In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense and there is no grossing up arrangement.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, because of the different arrangements, as outlined above, for claiming the tax relief and the fact that the records maintained by them do not readily differentiate between the different types of charities and approved bodies availing of the relief, the information requested by the deputy is not readily available and either could not be identified or could not be identified without conducting an extensive investigation of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), that the total value of the Fund at 31 March 2012 was &euro;15.1 billion and that the value of the Discretionary Portfolio was &euro;5.8 billion.   In announcing the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) initiative in September 2011, the Government indicated a refocusing of the investments of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from global towards Ireland. Commercial investment will be channeled from the NPRF towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. </P>
        <P>A key principle of the Strategic Investment Fund is that the NPRF investment, which is to be solely on a commercial basis, will seek matching investment from third-party investors. In this way the Fund&rsquo;s assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy. In addition, the Fund has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities relating to the commercial semi-state sector.</P>
        <P>The NPRF Commission announced in November 2011 a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.  The NPRF has also committed, subject to certain pre-conditions, &euro;450 million to finance the national roll-out of domestic water meters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Euro Area Summit Statement of 29th June affirmed that it is imperative that the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns be broken.  In addition, the Eurogroup Statement of 9th July stated that in order to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, technical discussions on the future ESM direct recapitalisation instrument will start in September.   The statements represent a major shift in European policy in terms of breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign.  This is something that the Irish Government has been saying is needed at a European level to help tackle the crisis.  However, these statements represent an agreement in principle only.  The policy statements provide a basis for a Euro-area solution to what is essentially a Euro-area problem but the details, structures and arrangements concerning how the solution will be achieved have yet to be finalised.</P>
        <P>While detailed work is now underway it would not be appropriate to prejudge the outcome of the meeting of Eurogroup Finance Ministers of 9th July or any further discussions to take place between Eurogroup Finance Ministers in the coming months by making further statements beyond the principle that we are in favour of the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt and that we welcome the developments reflected in both the Euro Area Summit Statement of 29th June and the subsequent Eurogroup Statement of 9th July stating that it is imperative that the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns be broken.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide details of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; investigation underway into a syndicate of almost 200 individuals using an intricate offshore tax avoidance scheme; if he will provide an indication of the amount of money involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners do not comment on or provide information in relation to the tax affairs of any particular individual or group of individuals. However, I assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question is based on a newspaper report of 8 July 2012. I am informed that enquiries in relation to this matter are ongoing at present and the Revenue Commissioners are not currently in a position to indicate the tax at risk.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s Anti-Avoidance Unit specifically deals with the identification and challenging of aggressive tax avoidance schemes and unintended use of legislation that threatens tax yields and the perceived fairness of the tax system. Where Revenue becomes aware of tax avoidance schemes, they investigate such schemes. In general tax avoidance is tackled in two ways, by challenging the individual cases as they arise or through the use of the general anti-avoidance provisions in Section 811 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In addition, where Revenue identifies any artificial tax avoidance arrangements that require specific anti-avoidance rules, they will recommend appropriate legislative amendments to my Department for consideration in the context of the annual Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>In addition the Mandatory Disclosure regime introduced in the 2010 Finance Act came into effect on 17 January 2011 (first disclosures were required by 15 April 2011). This legislation requires promoters of certain tax-based schemes to disclose them to Revenue shortly after they are first marketed or made available for implementation. This regime is designed to act as an &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; system in tackling tax avoidance schemes. The objectives of this regime are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />To obtain early information about certain tax schemes and how they work,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />To obtain information about who has availed of them, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />To close down by legislative action, or use of anti-avoidance provisions, any such schemes that are viewed as aggressive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I can assure the Deputy that I strongly support the Revenue Commissioners in tackling aggressive anti-avoidance schemes and the unintended use of legislation that threatens tax yield and the perceived fairness of the tax system.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the NPRF, that the total value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) at 30 June 2012 was &euro;13.9 billion, made up as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the Discretionary Portfolio, the investment of which remains the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility, was valued at &euro;5.8 billion (41.7% of total);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the Directed Portfolio, investments in Irish financial institutions made for public policy reasons at the direction of the Minister for Finance, was valued at &euro;8.1 billion (58.3% of the total).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Directed Portfolio consists of investments in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland that were undertaken on foot of directions from the Minister for Finance. Since 2009 the Fund has invested &euro;20.7 billion in preference shares and ordinary shares in the two banks, comprising &euro;4.7 billion in Bank of Ireland (where the Fund&rsquo;s shareholding is 15.1 per cent) and &euro;16.0 billion in Allied Irish Banks (where the Fund&rsquo;s shareholding is 99.8 per cent). The Fund has received a total of &euro;2.0 billion in cash from its Bank of Ireland investment &mdash; comprising preference share dividends, the repurchase of warrants by the Bank and the sale of ordinary shares to a consortium of private investors. The net proceeds from the sale of Bank of Ireland ordinary shares to private investors in 2011 were remitted to the Exchequer as directed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Directed Portfolio was valued, following the completion of an independent valuation review, at &euro;8.1 billion at 30 June 2012. The Directed Portfolio&rsquo;s holdings in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland comprise ordinary shares (valued at &euro;0.0076 or 0.76 cent per share and at market price respectively) and preference shares (valued at 63.5% of par and 80.2% of par respectively).  As the preference share investments in both banks are unlisted and the Fund holds 99.8% of the ordinary share holding in Allied Irish Banks, these investments are held at fair value as at 31 December 2011 in line with generally-accepted accounting principles.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that it is the stated intention of the Agency to return to the capital markets as soon as circumstances permit.  The conditions to allow for a successful return to the markets include the continued implementation of the programme agreed with the EU-IMF and progress in resolving the sovereign debt and banking crises in Europe. Our continued successful implementation of the EU-IMF Programme of Support, as repeatedly confirmed by the EU/ECB/IMF reviews, along with our firm commitment to achieve the programme targets combined with the measures agreed by EU Heads of State or Government on 29 June, have reinforced the confidence which investors have in Ireland. This is evidenced by the decline in our bond yields and the successful Treasury Bill auction carried out by the NTMA on 5 July. Between now and the end of the year, the NTMA plans to hold three to four auctions of short-term Treasury Bills similar to the one successfully concluded on 5 July. The Agency is planning to diversify its sources of funding through the first Irish sovereign issuance of amortising bonds and inflation-linked bonds specifically tailored to the needs of the domestic pensions industry.  Market conditions permitting, the aim is also to issue a conventional medium to long-term bond.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the IMF will remain fully satisfied with the NTMA&rsquo;s plans for a phased return to the markets, which has already commenced with the recent Treasury Bill auction.</P>

	<P>As I have stated on several occasions since the end-June euro area summit, including in responses to parliamentary questions and during last week&rsquo;s press conference at the end of the latest EU/IMF quarterly review mission, the amount of banking debt which could be considered as part of the discussions around breaking the link between recapitalising the banks and the sovereign will be identified during the detailed discussions.  Early negotiations on Ireland&rsquo;s bank debt are underway, with a view to concluding an agreement in October. However, I would not want Ireland to be constrained by setting a target figure and it is important not to prejudice the outcome of these negotiations by commenting on the likely contents of any agreement at this time.</P>
        <P>While the discussions around breaking the link between recapitalising the banks and the sovereign are undoubtedly a positive development for Ireland, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there remains a large gap between day to day spending and revenues. This needs to be closed so as to enhance further the long-term sustainability of our public finances.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that we will seek to be ambitious in the negotiations and will seek to agree the best deal possible for the Irish taxpayer. As and when further measures are agreed, I will inform the Houses as appropriate.</P>

        <P><i>Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited</i></P>
        <P>On 3 June 2011 the Central Bank issued a press statement relating to its investigation into Anglo Irish Bank and persons concerned in its management (Anglo). It was noted that, at an early stage in its investigation, the Central Bank notified the Garda&iacute; and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) of certain suspected offences.  Regular liaison with these agencies continues.  As part of that liaison process, the Central Bank advised the Garda&iacute; of the Bank&rsquo;s intention in 2011 to examine specific issues arising from its investigation. At that stage, the Garda&iacute; informed the Central Bank, following consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), that, if the Central Bank proceeded with its investigation, it may prejudice any future criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the Central Bank decided to defer its investigation and undertook to keep this decision under review.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where, after liaison with the Garda&iacute; and the DPP, the Central Bank commences an investigation, such an investigation will have available an appropriate level of resources.</P>

	<P>The overall level and composition between revenue and current and capital expenditure measures of the Budget 2013 fiscal adjustment was set out in last November&rsquo;s Medium-Term Fiscal Statement and again in April&rsquo;s Stability Programme Update (SPU). The EU/IMF Programme Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) also refers to a similar level of adjustment and similar split between revenue and current and capital expenditure measures as being necessary to reduce the General Government deficit to 7.5% of GDP next year, in line with our commitments. The MOU is an evolving document. Certain adjustments can be made to it following consultation with the Troika while at the same maintaining respect for the overall budgetary targets. </P>

	<P>There is currently no mechanism for the State to inject capital into credit unions, outside of the context of resolution. The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) operates on an all-island basis a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions. The SPS is funded by the sector and operates by providing financial support to credit unions that get into difficulty.  As this is a privately owned and managed fund it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested. </P>
        <P>The Commission on Credit Unions Report recommended the establishment of a statutory stabilisation mechanism whereby financial assistance could be given to credit unions on an individual basis, in certain limited circumstances, with certain conditions attached to the provision of such assistance. This would be facilitated by the establishment of a stabilisation fund to be managed by the Central Bank. The General Scheme of the Credit Union Bill 2012 which was published on 28 June 2012 sets out the legislative proposals on this statutory stabilisation mechanism.</P>
        <P>The restructuring of the credit union sector on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis formed a core recommendation of the Report of the Commission. The Report set out a timescale for the completion of the restructuring process by end 2015.  The General Scheme of the Credit Union Bill 2012 also makes provision for the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (the ReBo) to oversee and facilitate the restructuring of credit unions. The ReBo will engage with credit unions over the coming months and will assist credit unions with restructuring proposals and due diligence. These proposals, which may include proposals for transfer or amalgamations of credit unions, will then be presented to the Board of the ReBo to consider.  If funding is required, the first call will be on the excess capital within the merging credit unions. The affordability of sector wide contributions will also be assessed.  If further funding is required, Exchequer funding may be provided on a recoupable basis.</P>

        <Quest> if he is concerned at the residence and issuance principles contained within the European Commission proposal for a Financial Transaction Tax which are not considered in the Central Bank-ESRI assessment; if it will affect financial transactions carried out in Ireland on securities that are issue in another EU country that decides to participate in an FTT through enhanced co-operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36181/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) is a residence based tax &mdash; that is, a transaction would be subject to the tax if one of the parties was a financial institution which is resident in one of the Member States.  Sections 2 and 3 of the ESRI/Central Bank report discuss the residence basis of the tax.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal did not envisage that the FTT would be charged on an issuance basis &mdash; that is, by reference to whether the company whose shares were being transferred, or whose shares were subject to a derivative transaction, was resident or registered in an EU Member State. The European Parliament has proposed that the FTT should operate on both a residence basis and an issuance basis, so that a transaction would be liable to an FTT it was carried out by a financial institution in an EU Member State or if it involved a transfer of shares or a derivative transaction related to shares in a company registered in an EU Member State.  While the Council (comprising representatives of the EU member state Governments) is obliged to consult with the European Parliament before adopting a final position on Commission proposals, the European Parliament specifically does not have co-legislator status for proposals in the taxation area, as it would for example with co-decision proposals in other areas. In other words, while the European Parliament must be consulted, they have no decision making powers on tax matters.</P>
        <P>Although the Commission&rsquo;s proposed FTT would be on a residence basis, the new French FTT is charged on an issuance basis &mdash; it applies if the shares are issued in France, and the company has market capitalization in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Our Stamp Duty on share transactions is also charged on an issuance basis &mdash; it applies to instruments and deemed instruments which transfer shares in Irish incorporated companies &mdash; as is the UK Stamp Duty Reserve Tax.</P>
        <P>It is not clear as yet what form the &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo; FTT will take but if it was introduced on a residence basis, it is possible that a transaction could be subject both to an FTT and Irish Stamp Duty &mdash; for example, a purchase of shares in an Irish registered company by a financial institution in one of the &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo; Member States.  As I stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 31431/12 on 28 June 2012, we will continue to monitor discussions on the FTT to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions, including our Stamp Duty.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department recently published its revised Statement of Strategy for 2012-2014. This document, which is available at on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>, sets out the Department&rsquo;s five key goals for the period:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. A resilient Irish economy founded on sustainable and balanced growth and leading to significant increases in employment numbers.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. A sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. An improvement in the living standards of our citizens.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Return by Ireland to international debt markets so as to achieve an exit from the EU/IMF funding programme at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. Completion of the restructuring of the banking system and a vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector. The Statement of Strategy also outlines the Department&rsquo;s mission &ldquo;to manage Government finances and play a central role in the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s economic and social goals having regard to the Programme for Government.&rdquo; The Department has made significant progress in implementing the relevant aspects of the Programme for Government: 28 commitments have been implemented, 21 are on-going or underway while 5 are under review or cannot be introduced in the manner in which they are stated in the Programme for Government. More detail on the all the Programme for Government commitments are available in the Programme for Government Annual Report 2012  available at <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>. Since the publication of that report there has been further progress in a number of areas including the publication of the Personal Insolvency Bill, the publication of a report of the regional meetings on credit supply, the on-going move toward decreasing Government support to the banks, the publication of the Commission on Credit Unions&rsquo; final report, the publication of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, the on-going work to implement a property tax, and continuing augmentation of the skill set of the Department, including the position of Chief Economist which was advertised externally.</P>

        <Quest> if he has any plans to equalise the duty rates between agricultural fuels and motor fuels and to introduce a reclaim system for agricultural fuel users; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is assumed that the Deputy&rsquo;s question envisages a movement away from the current system of marking of oil to which a reduced rate of tax applies to one in which certain users would be given refunds of part of the mineral oil tax paid by them in respect of fuel used for non-auto purposes.  A change of this kind would, however, involve the establishment of an extensive repayments system, which would give rise to a significant administrative burden and costs for oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners, as well as posing significant cash-flow costs for those who currently use marked oil.  Moreover, repayment systems are vulnerable to abuse and would be likely to be targeted by criminal elements such as those currently involved in oil laundering. </P>
        <P>For those reasons, it is not clear that a repayment system would offer greater security against  fraud than the current arrangements There are no plans, therefore to move to a reclaim system as suggested by the Deputy.  The intention is to ensure that controls relating to the sale and distribution of oils, and enforcement action for combating laundering, are as effective as possible, and significant steps are being taken to enhance the supervision of the oils supply chain.</P>

	<P>It is my Department&rsquo;s policy to comply with the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2001. These acts apply to Public Servants who hold positions whose maximum salary is not less than the maximum salary of a principal officer (general service grade class B PRSI) and to other positions in the Public service that have been prescribed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for the purposes of the Ethics Acts. Typically these are positions that interface with the commercial sector and are listed in Appendix 2 of the &ldquo;Guidelines on Compliance with the Provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 and 2011. The latest edition of these Guidelines was issued in November 2011.  Section 4.2 of the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Staff Code of Ethics and Behaviour (Code) (revised and issued in July 2011) provides that management and staff should avoid any situation that would result in a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict in their official dealings, particularly in the context of the receipt of gifts or business hospitality. Failure to adhere to the organisation&rsquo;s rules on the acceptance of gifts and business hospitality may result in disciplinary action. </P>
        <P>The covered banks policies are as follows:</P>
        <P><i>AIB:</i></P>
        <P>AIB has a Code of Conduct for all staff which covers, inter alia, the receipt of gifts.  AIB  Management and Staff may accept or provide entertainment or gifts only if they are not intended to compromise independent decision making, are small in value and comply with applicable laws and regulations and are in accordance with internal thresholds.  Internal requirements are in place for declaration and approval of gifts received.&rdquo;</P>
        <P><i>BOI:</i></P>
        <P>Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct prohibits all staff from accepting any gifts that might influence the decisions that they or others make in business transactions involving the Bank, or that others might reasonably believe would influence their decisions, or compromise the integrity or ability of the staff member to exercise independent judgement. If in doubt regarding the appropriateness of a gift, invitation or other benefit, staff are advised to discuss the matter with their manager.</P>
        <P><i>IBRC:</i></P>
        <P>As part of IBRC&rsquo;s wider &lsquo;Conflicts of Interest Policy&rsquo;, the Bank&rsquo;s policy with regards to gifts, hospitality and other benefits states that in general, directors and employees must not accept gifts or the conveyance of anything of value (including entertainment) from current or prospective Bank customers or suppliers.  Similarly, directors and employees may not accept or allow a close family member to accept gifts, services, loans or preferential treatment from anyone (including customers, suppliers or others) in exchange for or in connection with a past, current or future business relationship with the Bank.</P>
        <P><i>Permanent TSB:</i></P>
        <P>Permanent TSB&rsquo;s Code of Ethics states that &ldquo;No gifts, sponsorships, hospitality, services or inducements should ever be offered or given by you (other than arising in approved business development activity), or be solicited or accepted by you, which would compromise, or give the appearance of compromising, your position, your duties or any business decision taken by you on behalf of the Group. If you are in any doubt as to the propriety of accepting any gift, sponsorship, hospitality or services, you should refer the matter to your Line Manager and/or the Compliance Officer for your division. All gifts, sponsorship, hospitality or services offered to you in excess of &euro;300 must be approved in advance by your Line Manager.&rdquo;</P>

This process covers establishing the true financial position of a borrower via a sworn net worth statement and a formal request for a repayment plan to repay the debt as quickly as possible with the maximum recovery. This process also examines whether any unencumbered assets could be pledged to IBRC to enhance existing security and to provide additional repayment sources.  IBRC endeavours to capture any surplus income from Debtors to aid overall recovery. IBRC have also advised me that they are committed to the maximum recovery under each loan facility as agreed under the commitments letter between IBRC and the EU in accordance with normal commercial practice and fiduciary duties.</P>

	<P>It is the responsibility of each credit union to make sure that it makes adequate provision in its accounts for bad or doubtful debts to ensure that it is sufficiently funded to cover loan losses.  Credit unions must also maintain reserves of 10% of assets as a buffer against unexpected losses. The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has operated on an all-island basis a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions since 1989. The SPS operates by providing financial support to credit unions that get into difficulty.  This is a privately owned and managed fund. </P>
        <P>The Commission on Credit Unions recommended the establishment of a statutory stabilisation mechanism whereby financial assistance could be given to credit unions on an individual basis, in certain limited circumstances, with certain conditions attached to the provision of such assistance. This would be facilitated by the establishment of a stabilisation fund to be managed by the Central Bank.  The General Scheme of the Credit Union Bill 2012, which was published on 28 June 2012, sets out the legislative proposals for this statutory stabilisation mechanism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the most recent ECOFIN meeting on Friday 22 June, it became clear that EU-wide agreement would not be reached on the Commission&rsquo;s proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT).  Those countries that want to enact an FTT will now request the Commission to put forward a proposal that it be introduced via &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo;. This mechanism would require at least nine Member States to participate and would require agreement by Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) comprising 72% of the overall votes and states representing 65% of the total EU population. Ireland is not going to be among the &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo; countries but we will not stand in the way of those who want to introduce an FTT under this mechanism.  I have stated clearly in the past that, if an FTT cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on an EU-wide basis.  This would prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.  I have also indicated our principled opposition to dealing with tax measures under &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo;.  So our non-participation in the new &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo; initiative is consistent with the position we have taken to date on the FTT.</P>
        <P>It is also not clear what shape the FTT will finally take.  The draft Directive had only received one initial reading and the current proposal could be modified.</P>
        <P>A significant concern is that an FTT could affect transactions in Irish Government bonds, particularly in the secondary market, and may also affect the ECB&rsquo;s ability to give effect to its own monetary policy via the repurchase (&ldquo;repo&rdquo;) market.  A number of countries such as Sweden and the UK have also raised this point in respect of their own debt management.  Given the difficulties faced by countries like Ireland, disruption of the Government paper market in the coming years would not be helpful.</P>
        <P>An FTT could also affect the financial services industry, especially in the IFSC, and lead to some activities and jobs moving abroad.  The UK is strongly opposed to an FTT and when other countries introduced similar taxes in the past, certain financial activities moved to London.</P>
        <P>We are also concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s own projections are that an FTT could reduce EU growth and raise the cost to ordinary, non-financial companies for their use of financial products.  Both these aspects would be harmful to EU recovery.</P>
        <P>We will continue to monitor discussions on whatever proposal emerges from the &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo; process to ensure it does not interfere with the single market and takes account of the positions of other Member States.  For example, any FTT on share transactions would have to take account of our existing Stamp Duty on Irish shares.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the restriction on the use of reliefs by high income individuals which was introduced with effect from 2007.  As indicated in my reply of 17 November 2011, to which the Deputy refers, the objective of the restriction for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 was to ensure that individuals with adjusted income of &euro;500,000 or more paid an effective rate of tax of approximately 20% on that income.  Following a tightening of the restriction in Finance Act 2010, the objective from 2010 has been to ensure that individuals with adjusted income of &euro;400,000 or more pay an effective income tax rate of approximately 30% on that income. For the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, where adjusted income was between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000, a graduated application of the restriction meant that the effective rate of tax increased towards 20% as adjusted income increased towards &euro;500,000.  For 2010 and later years, the graduated application of the restriction is designed to ensure that the effective rate of tax increases towards 30% as adjusted income increases towards &euro;400,000. Details of the number of individuals who were subject to the restriction and to whom the tapering system applied for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are available on individual reports headed &ldquo;Analysis of High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction&rdquo; on my Department&rsquo;s website at: http://taxpolicy.gov.ie/restriction-of-reliefs/.  Statistics are given in each report in relation to a number of bands of income under &euro;500,000 and include the average effective rate of tax that applied to individuals within each band both before and after the application of the restriction.</P>
        <P>Details of the number of individuals who were subject to the restriction in 2010 and to whom the tapering approach applied in that year will be included in a further report on the application of the restriction for 2010.  This report is currently being finalised and will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The particular circumstances of each taxpayer will determine the effective income tax rate in any year.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products, that they are acutely aware of the threat to the Exchequer posed by laundered fuel. The predominant illicit activity in the mineral oil area in this State and in Northern Ireland is the laundering of marked diesel and its sale through illegal outlets. In both jurisdictions the respective difference in excise rates between marked (rebated) and normal diesel offers a considerable incentive for oil laundering and this illicit activity poses a serious threat to the Exchequer and to the economy on both sides of the border. Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils. These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; closure of unlicensed or improperly licensed outlets and seizure of stock, and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.  </P>
        <P>In 2010, Revenue enforcement staff detected four oil-laundering plants in this jurisdiction and seized 228,000 litres of laundered oil. The DPP has issued directions to prosecute on indictment in two of these cases. A further 48,184 litres of illicit mineral oil was seized from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets In addition, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil and eight haulage companies were detected using it in their vehicles. There were four court convictions in 2010 for laundered oil offences.</P>
        <P>In 2011 nine oil laundries and 327,000 litres of laundered fuel were seized, together with nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles. Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of five of these cases and on summary disposal in a further case. Three other cases are en route to the DPP&rsquo;s Office seeking directions.  In addition, a further 718,181 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets.</P>
        <P>To date in 2012 six oil laundries and 135,050 litres of fuel has been seized together with one oil tanker and nine other vehicles. Two people were arrested in the course of these operations. In addition to this a further 317,725 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. To date in 2012 there have been two court convictions for laundered oil offences with a fine of &euro;2,500 imposed in one case and a two-year suspended sentence in the other.</P>
        <P>Revenue is also engaged in an ongoing and vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and challenging of instances of non-compliance.  In 2011 thirty-two filling stations were shut down by Revenue because they did not have a licence or were in breach of licensing conditions. To date in 2012, twenty such outlets have been closed.</P>
        <P>While there has been considerable success in detecting and closing oil laundries, it is recognised that this approach, in isolation, will not solve the problem. Oil launderers need to be denied access to marked oil for the purposes of laundering and they need to be denied access to the market for their laundered product. Since July last year the licensing regime for road fuels has been tightened up to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product on to the market.</P>
        <P>New legislation was enacted in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act which significantly strengthens the provisions for the control and supervision of the fuel supply chain and restricts the scope for illegal activity. The previous licence for persons dealing in road fuels has been replaced by a new auto-fuel trader&rsquo;s licence, as and from 1 July. In addition, anyone dealing in marked diesel or marked kerosene will now, for the first time, have to be licensed for the purpose. The requirement to have a marked fuel trader&rsquo;s licence comes into operation with effect from 1 October 2012.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are the licensing authority and will have power to refuse a licence where the applicant does not show to their satisfaction that relevant conditions that they may attach to the licence can be satisfied. Revenue are empowered also to revoke a licence, if the holder contravenes or fails to comply with the terms of the licence, or any provision of excise law relating to fuel.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the introduction of the new licensing system, the Regulations that lay down the detailed rules and requirements on mineral oil matters have been reviewed and new Regulations, containing additional and reinforced provisions, were recently made.  The requirements with regard to record keeping have been strengthened, and a new requirement for persons dealing in fuel to make periodic returns to Revenue has been introduced.  All traders, including traders in marked fuels, will have to make monthly returns, electronically, detailing their fuel transactions.  This system of returns, which will come into operation from the start of next year, will be an important new source of information for Revenue in relation to the supply chain. It will, for example, assist in the identification of unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.</P>
        <P>In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the UK have been working in partnership to identify a new, more effective marker.  A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the two authorities.  A joint &ldquo;Invitation to Make Submissions&rdquo; (IMS) seeking proposals was published in June.  Both authorities are committed to seeking the widest possible range of proposals, so that the most effective marker for the future can be identified.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is 30 November.</P>
        <P>Revenue have committed to applying ten per cent of their compliance resources to combating the illicit trade in mineral oil. The legislative steps that have been taken, together with the work on the development of a more effective fuel marker, will provide important new support and enhance the effectiveness of compliance action.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that the tackling of this illicit trade is a key objective.  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions in line with Government targets to reduce public service numbers.  However, I recognise the need to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue while meeting the existing Employment Control Framework allocations. In that context, I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to consider reducing Revenue&rsquo;s target staff numbers over a longer time period, whilst at the same time allowing Revenue to replace critical skills and experience.</P>
        <P>In 2010 Revenue established a high-level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans. This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue&rsquo;s website, includes a number of programmes which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In 2011 a total of six national tobacco blitzes were carried out resulting in the seizure of more than 19m cigarettes and 1,345 Kgs of Tobacco. A total of &euro;30,000 in cash and 49 vehicles used as conveyances were also seized.  Six arrests were made and 103 cases have been identified as possible prosecution cases.  To date in 2012 two national tobacco blitzes have been held resulting in the seizure of 1.3m cigarettes and 654 kgs tobacco.  Two people were arrested and 12 vehicles used as conveyances were also seized. Twenty-nine cases have been identified as possible prosecution cases.</P>
        <P>In 2011, a total of 109.08m cigarettes with a retail value of &euro;45.95m and 11,158 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &euro;4m were seized by Revenue.  In addition to this Revenue has obtained one hundred and one convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of &euro;136,300 imposed, and thirty custodial sentences of which twenty were suspended. There were a further fifty-seven convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of &euro;115,850 imposed, and thirteen custodial sentences of which seven were suspended.</P>
        <P>In 2012 to date a total of 66.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &euro;29.9m and 2,555<b> </b>kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &euro;0.94m have been seized by Revenue.  In addition to this Revenue has obtained thirty-three convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of &euro;56,250 imposed, and thirteen custodial sentences of which four were<b> </b>suspended. There were a further forty-six convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of &euro;84,200 imposed, and ten custodial sentences of which seven were suspended.</P>

        <P>Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires that Government memoranda indicate clearly, as appropriate, the impact of a proposal for, amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>With regard to the impact of tax increases in <i>Budget 2012</i>  , I am not aware of the analysis that the Deputy is relying on for his assertion that tax increases impacted differently on men and women. Issues related to public expenditure are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the tables below that set out AIB&rsquo;s schedule for Secured and Unsecured Senior Bonds.  I am informed by AIB that the Bank has a planned term issuance schedule that will refinance maturing wholesale debt maturities, including a combination of Secured Funding and Government Guaranteed bond issues with unguaranteed issuances restarting from 2014 onwards. The extent of AIB&rsquo;s wholesale funding refinancing requirements will be influenced by the level of customer deposit funding and deleveraging activity.</P>

	<P>Revisions to historical GDP outturns are standard practice, particularly for the more recent year&rsquo;s figures. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has informed me that the main reason for the revision to 2009 and 2010 estimates is the availability of more up to date information, specifically the results of the 2009/2010 Household Budget Survey, first estimates of corporate profits and income from self-employment in respect of 2010 from Revenue Commissioner data and more definitive information from some of the large cases.  The April Maastricht Returns set out details of the estimated General Government Balance (GGB) and General Government Debt (GGD) outturns for the period 2008-2011. The figures for the years 2009-2011 are set out in table 1 below:</P>

	<P>A working group was established last year to examine charges in the pensions industry. The group is chaired by the Department of Social Protection with representatives of the Central Bank and the Pensions Board. This study will provide an initial benchmark on the level of charges for different forms of funded supplementary pension arrangements and will provide information in relation to the disclosure of charges. These data have not been available to date so the study will provide valuable information to inform policy. I understand that it is intended to present the group&rsquo;s report to my colleague, Ms Joan Burton TD, the Minister for Social Protection, by end-August, following which appropriate decisions will be made on its contents and recommendations, and among other things, on the scope for productive interaction with the pensions industry in relation to offsetting the impact of the pension fund levy through reductions in fees or charges.</P>

        <Quest> when Ireland will make its first capital contribution to the European Stability Mechanism; the size of the contribution; the way it will be funded; the dates on which future contributions are due to be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The capital structure of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is set out in the ESM Treaty which was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. To obtain the highest possible credit rating, the capital structure of the ESM will have a total subscribed capital of &euro;700bn. Of this amount, &euro;80bn will be in the form of paid-in capital by the Euro Area Member States, paid in five equal instalments. The balance of &euro;620bn will be callable capital.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of the &euro;80bn in paid-in capital, based on our contribution key set out in Annex 1 of the ESM Treaty, will be just above &euro;1.27bn paid in five equal instalments of &euro;254m. This will be paid out of the Central Fund. The ESM is being established as an International Financial Institution and on that basis Ireland&rsquo;s contribution will be treated as a financial transaction. This means that while it will impact on Ireland&rsquo;s Exchequer Borrowing Requirement, it will not impact on its General Government Deficit. Ireland&rsquo;s share of the &euro;620bn callable capital is based on the same key, i.e. 1.592% of &euro;620bn making the callable capital &euro;9.87bn.</P>
        <P>Article 41 of the ESM Treaty provides that the first instalment shall be paid by each ESM member within fifteen days of the date of entry into force of the ESM Treaty. However, as the Deputy will be aware, due to on-going legal challenges to the ESM Treaty in a number of Euro Area Member States, including Ireland, the date of the ESM coming into force is not yet certain but it is hoped that the Treaty will come into force sometime in early Autumn. The first instalment of paid-in capital will become payable within fifteen days of that date.</P>
        <P>In terms of future contributions, that is, the four remaining instalments to be paid to the ESM, the Eurogroup decided on 30 March 2012 that the paid-in capital would be made available more quickly than initially foreseen in the original ESM Treaty with two tranches to be paid in 2012, one in July and one in October 2012, two tranches to be paid in 2013 and a final tranche to be paid in the first half of 2014. The contribution planned for July will not proceed as the ESM has not yet come into force and also as Ireland has yet to ratify the Treaty. As already indicated, the first instalment will be payable by Ireland within 15 days of the date of entry into force of the ESM Treaty provided Ireland has ratified the Treaty by that date.</P>

        <Quest> if he is concerned by the contraction in GNP over the past three quarters; the implications of this trend for employment and future taxation revenue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding the recent contraction in GNP.  As has been well documented, Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery will be export led.  This is how growth in a small open economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s should be driven and we are once again seeing evidence of that, with exports growing by over 5 per cent in 2011 and by 6.1 per cent in the first three months of 2012.  Indeed, recently the CSO released a revised growth forecast for 2011 which saw real GDP expand by 1.4 per cent.  While the economy is growing again, it will take time for export growth to feed through to the labour market and the domestic economy. Moreover, it will take households and firms time to work through the imbalances which had built up during the boom. The Government is acutely aware of the headwinds which the domestic economy faces in this regard. We have therefore taken a number of steps to support domestic activity and job creation, including the introduction of the Jobs Initiative shortly after coming into office and the structuring of Budget 2012 in such a way as to be as growth-friendly as possible.  Indeed, there is some evidence of stabilisation in the labour market with the number of private sector jobs increasing by 13,500 year-on-year in Q1 2012.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the stimulus announced on the 17th of July will help to sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs. It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.</P>
        <P>In relation to taxation, the latest Exchequer Returns for the period to end-June show that tax revenues are performing well, increasing significantly year-on-year and over &euro;&frac12; billion or 3.1 per cent ahead of target. This is an encouraging performance in the circumstances and while it must be acknowledged that there are large tax revenues targets to meet in the second half of the year, I am confident at this point that our overall tax revenue target for the year will be achieved.</P>

        <P>The Student Grant Scheme and the Student Support Regulations for the 2012/13 academic year were published by my Department on the 11th of June 2012 to coincide with the introduction of the single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland or SUSI, and the new central online application system going live.

	<P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the General Allocation Model (GAM) of additional teaching supports which are allocated to all Primary schools to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>As I have previously advised the Deputy, differing pupil teacher ratios are applied under the GAM in relation to boys, girls and mixed schools in order to account for differentials of prevalence of learning difficulty between boys and girls.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls.</P>
        <P>The NCSE Report on the Implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, of 2006, also examined a range of sources to establish prevalence rates, including national databases, local and international studies and expert estimates, which indicated significantly higher rates of Mild General Learning Difficulty and Specific Learning Disability prevailing in boys, in comparison to girls.</P>
        <P>Revised arrangements which will update schools&rsquo; GAM allocations with effect from September 2012, based on the number of class teaching posts in schools for the previous year, reflect the existing arrangements for the allocation of supports under the GAM. The pupil teacher ratios which had previously applied are set out in my Departments Circular SP ED 02/05, which is available on <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that in primary schools, including schools in the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme, teaching supports for pupils with special education needs are provided though two channels. Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence or less complex, disability category. Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence or more complex category of special need, as defined by my Department&rsquo;s Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</P>
        <P>All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support, including supports allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Departments guidance. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Details of the current funding allocated to each Vocational Educational Committee in 2011 are listed in the attached table.  These allocations enabled the VECs to provide a broad range of educational services. In addition to providing post-primary education and further and adult education, VECs also have responsibilities in areas such as community education, training for early school leavers, basic literacy courses, and the provision of a range of youth services. My Department provides the majority of the funding required by VECs for the delivery of these programmes.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the figures in the table include funding for pay to VEC staff (including teachers), funding for the day-to-day running of schools, specific grants (e.g. book grant, transition year programme), targeted expenditure (e.g. DEIS funding), funding for further and adult education (e.g. Youthreach and VTOS) and funding for student grants.</P>

	<P>In October 2011 the General Scheme of an Education and Training Boards Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education. The General Scheme was also published at that time. Following discussions with this Department and relevant stakeholders, the Committee prepared a report which I responded to at a meeting of the Committee on 25 January 2012. The General Scheme was then referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting. It is hoped that the Bill will be published before the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>I have received representations seeking to provide a place for adult learners on the Education and Training Boards. Consideration will be given to those representations in the course of the drafting of the legislation.</P>

        <P>I understand the difference in costs arose as one of the schools was allocated funding under my Department&rsquo;s 2007 Small School Scheme to extended and refurbish their existing school building which had difficult site conditions while the other school was allocated funding under my Department&rsquo;s 2010 Additional Accommodation Scheme to provide a new 253m² school building on a Greenfield site provided by the patron.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware a new student contribution charge of &euro;2,000 was introduced in higher education by the previous Government with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year. This charge replaced the previous Student Services Charge and applies to all students who currently benefit under the &ldquo;free fees&rdquo; scheme.</P>
        <P>The Charge is due to increase to &euro;2,250 for the next academic year.  The Finance Bill 2012, provides for tax relief at the standard rate of tax for full-time fees in excess of &euro;2,250.  Therefore, based on current rates of relief, the effective cost of the student contribution charge, net of tax relief, for second and subsequent siblings will be &euro;1,800 each.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has written to higher education institutions requesting that they show flexibility and consideration to students awaiting a decision on their grant application and/or payment of grants for the current academic year. At my Department&rsquo;s request the HEA have recently sent a reminder to institutions again requesting that flexibility be shown to students for the next academic year and to request that students be allowed pay the charge in two instalments if required.</P>
        <P>The charge is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under my Department&rsquo;s student grant scheme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs. Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.</P>
        <P>Some students with autism require further support in school. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of over 5,000 children with autism. These figures include101 classes for autism in Co. Dublin. The NCSE will continue to establish more classes as required.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circulars for allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</P>
        <P>I have arranged for the issues raised by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their direct attention and reply.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General confirms that over &euro;8 million in unauthorised payments were made to senior university staff over the period June 2005 to February 2011. This is completely unacceptable behaviour and represents a failure in governance in our universities and is a serious breach of public pay policy.  Since the formation of the current Government these unauthorised payments, which were presided over by previous administrations, have ceased in all cases.</P>
        <P>While these overpayments happened on the previous Government&rsquo;s watch, we are determined to ensure they cannot happen again. It is my intention, as part of the National Strategy implementation process, to strengthen legislation and put more robust accountability processes in place for the sector.</P>
        <P>The HEA, acting in consultation with my Department and the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, is making arrangements with each university covering the use of an amount of their funding equivalent in each case to the amount of overpayments. These arrangements will be directed towards improving student services and specific new innovations in front line services. It is an imperative that any action taken does not impact on students, especially at a time when resources are particularly limited.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that my Department has sought and received unequivocal commitments from each university that in future it will adhere to the provisions of the Universities Act. In the context of annual reporting arrangements provided for in the Code of Governance of Irish Universities each University is required to submit a statement to the HEA affirming that Government policy on pay is being complied with.</P>

	<P>As a result of Budget 2012, Circular 70/2011 provides that teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date.  Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011.  The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.</P>
        <P>Pending the outcome of the review of allowances, they are not payable to new beneficiaries from 1 February 2012.  The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, for a limited period of time, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances.  These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.</P>
        <P>These measures are concerned with the sustainability of the public service pay bill and in particular the need to find payroll savings in the education vote.  Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.  I am not in a position to comment further until the outcome of the review is known.</P>

The report outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers, and provides some evidence on the possible impacts of this on quality of provision.  However, the HEA has emphasised that the report is preliminary only and that substantial additional work now needs to be undertaken before comprehensive proposals as to how we can sustainably fund higher education into the future can be developed.  The HEA is continuing its work in this area and further advice is expected later this year.</P>

	<P>My key priority in second level education is the reform of the Junior Cycle.  I am aware that reform is also required in senior cycle. In this context, curriculum and assessment reform is well advanced in a number of senior cycle subject areas.  Project Maths has been introduced to all schools now and the first examination incorporating Project Maths for the Leaving Certificate took place in June of this year.  The roll out will continue to be reviewed and adjusted over the next few years, as necessary.  As part of this process, a joint NCCA/HEA conference on Mathematics education in Ireland will bring together Irish and international experts in the field.  This conference will take place in the Autumn.  June 2012 also saw the first examinations in Leaving Certificate Gaeilge under the new assessment arrangements, where 40% of the marks awarded are allocated to oral language skills.</P>
        <P>Work is also progressing in relation to the development of key skills across the curriculum as well as in the following subjects &mdash;  biology, chemistry and physics.  A review of the four modern languages, French, German, Italian and Spanish is well underway and will be the subject of consultation this coming Autumn.</P>
        <P>As well as the work on senior cycle curriculum and assessment reform, a number of other areas are being progressed that relate directly to the transition from second to third level education.  These areas of work arose from the very successful joint HEA/NCCA conference last September and include:</P>

	<P>I published the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011 to 2020 in July 2011.  The Strategy contains 41 actions and almost 180 sub-actions across 6 key areas.  A high level implementation Advisory Group has been established to monitor the implementation of the Strategy over its lifespan up until 2020.</P>
        <P>There has been significant progress in implementing the early actions of the Strategy and work is ongoing on medium and longer term actions.  Some of the key developments to date are set out below:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A team of literacy and numeracy advisors have been appointed to support teachers and schools in implementing the Strategy and a national programme of professional development for primary and second level teachers is under way.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Programmes in literacy (including Irish) and mathematics accounted for almost half of all attendance at summer courses in 2011.  Further summer courses for teachers in this area are being provided this summer.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Proposals on revised entry standards for initial teacher education have been incorporated into the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers in relation to mathematics.  There will be a consultation process on this.  The criteria also provide for an expansion of the primary Bachelor of Education from 3 to 4 years, and for an expansion of the Professional Diploma in Education to 2 years.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Units on literacy and numeracy are in place within the National Teacher Induction Programme for the 2011/12 school year.</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase the time spent on literacy by one hour per week,</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />Introduce a third point of standardised testing in English reading and Mathematics, so that pupils are tested at the end of 2nd, 4th and 6th class.  Irish medium schools are asked to also test students in Irish reading. Additional funding has been provided to schools to support this.</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />Report the results of the tests to parents as part of an overall standardised report on their children&rsquo;s learning,</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide data on 6th class pupils&rsquo; progress to their second level school, once enrolment has been accepted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One of the aims of my Junior Cycle reform programme is to develop an approach to promote the integrated development of literacy and numeracy skills across the curriculum.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy Among Children and Young People contains initiatives and actions across a broad range of areas and across the time span up to 2020.  The Strategy focuses on achieving better literacy and numeracy outcomes for our children and young people through the best use of the resources at our disposal.  Many of the approaches set out in the Strategy have no cost implications.</P>
        <P>There will be additional costs for teacher education measures (both initial teacher education and teacher upskilling), curricular change and new assessment measures.  Costs relating to lengthening of initial teacher education will be met from within the Higher Education Budget.  Part of the other costs will be met within existing resources from other areas of continuous professional development. Some additional curricular and assessment costs from 2014 will be found within other areas of the Department&rsquo;s Budget.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the identification and assessment of children with special needs</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the nature of supports provided for children</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the way in which supports are allocated to schools and</P>

	<P>Firstly, I wish to reiterate this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of resources for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government sets out that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.</P>
        <P>Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &mdash; some &euro;1.3 billion &mdash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2011.  This provision is in line with expenditure in 2010 and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs:  &mdash; 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the coming school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Approximately 9,950 learning support/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary and post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Over 1,000 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over &euro;60m per year.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Early educational intervention is provided for children with autism from 2&frac12; years of age.  There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department.  Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2&frac12; years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.</P>
        <P>Whereas it is not possible to anticipate future budgetary decisions, my Government is committed to the protection of frontline services for pupils with special educational needs.</P>

I am informed that the number of postgraduate enrolments has been gradually increasing in HEA funded institutions over the last five years with an overall increase of 26% between 2006/07 and 2010/11. There has however been  a slight decrease in full-time postgraduate enrolments (-1%) between 2009/10 and 2010/11. Part-time enrolments between these years has remained stable. </P>

	<P>As I committed to the House, I will ensure publication of the report at the earliest possible date which I expect will be shortly after the summer.</P>
        <P>I have discussed the progress of the report with my officials and realise that it has not proved possible to meet the original timeframe envisaged due to the amount of detailed technical work involved.  Nevertheless, this detailed technical work was necessary so that the review would comprehensively explore the scope for possible alternative organisational approaches and identify the potential implications of any such arrangements for small schools.  This is vital to provide a sound evidence base for policy making.</P>
        <P>Publication of the review report will help to inform our decision-making in relation to small primary schools.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.</P>
        <P>73 small primary schools were originally due to lose a classroom teacher in September 2012 as a result of the budget measure to increase the relevant pupil thresholds.  The Staffing Appeals Board provisionally upheld appeals from 41 schools subject to confirmation that their actual enrolments in September 2012 reach the required level.  The breakdown of the remaining 32 schools is attached.</P>
        <P>In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</P>

	<P>For the first time ever, my Department undertook a survey of schools to establish the position regarding school book rental and loan schemes for the school year 2011/12 and their plans to operate such a scheme for 2012/13.  This survey was completed in early 2012.</P>
        <P>The 3300 primary and special schools nationwide were asked in their annual returns to my Department if they operated a textbook or loan scheme in 2011/12 to enable pupils to rent or borrow some or all of their main books.  Approximately 99% of the schools responded and 2519 schools, which represents 76% of primary schools, stated that they operated such a scheme.</P>
        <P>The results at second level were not as conclusive, as only 44% of the 723 post-primary schools responded to the question in a separate survey.  The number of post-primary which had a textbook rental scheme was 230.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have the data available for the school year 2010/11, as requested by the Deputy.</P>

        <P>All schools must continue to provide guidance to their pupils however from the start of the new school year guidance provision will be managed by schools from within their standard staffing allocation.  Circular 0009/2012 issued by my Department while informing post primary school management and staff of the revised arrangements confirmed the requirement to provide for guidance.  This was in response to claims that schools would abandon guidance provision altogether.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the coming school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.</P>
        <P>I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194, 195 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Minister I have written to the Chairpersons of University Governing Bodies requesting them to ask all relevant individuals, including Presidents, who earn in excess of &euro;200,000, to make voluntary waivers of salary.  While two individuals, one of whom is a university Head, have agreed to make personal arrangements with their employer regarding a deduction of the amount of salary over &euro;200,000, there have been no voluntary waivers made for the benefit of the State.</P>
        <P>I cannot enforce a voluntary waiver nor can I insist that a waiver, if made, follows any particular format.  For example, if an employee chooses to waive a portion of his/her salary in favour of a charity or their employer they are free to do so.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has decided that a salary ceiling of &euro;200,000 will apply to future appointments to senior positions across the Public Service.</P>
        <P>The current approved total remuneration in respect of each university Head is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Trinity College, Dublin: &euro;201,492.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />University College, Dublin: &euro;202,118.</P>

	<P>The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which must be made in the coming years present challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education.  The funding of our higher education sector is addressed as part of the budgetary process each year.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to driving reforms to radically reduce costs across the public service whilst improving service and strengthening the fiscal position of the economy.  In order to drive this agenda, last November, my colleague Brendan Howlin announced a number of important initiatives for the reform of the Public Service including a comprehensive Public Service Reform Plan which includes actions across fourteen key areas.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education sector in particular has a strong track record in establishing shared services and some of these are now well established brands &mdash; including HEAnet and the CAO.  There are a number of projects underway in the sector including the increased use of aggregated and shared procurement which are delivering savings for the institutions.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to work with the higher education sector and the wider education sector to achieve savings including through the implementation of shared service arrangements.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy for Higher Education, published in 2011, provides the blueprint for developing a more coherent and efficient higher education system in Ireland.  The Strategy envisages the development of institutional mergers and regional collaborative clusters which will see the delivery of significant efficiencies in terms of programme delivery, quality enhancement and cost savings.  The implementation of the Strategy recommendations is ongoing.  The landscape documentation published by the HEA on 13th February includes guidelines for regional clusters and criteria for institutional mergers in the institute of technology sector and is available on <i>www.hea.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>It is essential that we balance the need for sustainable growth in higher education with the need to protect the reputation and quality of our institutions and graduates, if Ireland is to continue to attract investment and encourage economic growth and job creation.</P>

	<P>The attached table gives details of the Freedom of Information Requests received by my Department since March 2011.  This information is divided between Personal and non-Personal requests.  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the final cut-off date for late applications to the Redress Board was 17th September 2011.  This resulted in a significant increase in the number of personal requests received by my Department.  The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act 2011 removed the Board&rsquo;s power to accept late applications received on or after the 17th September, 2011.  By that date the Board had received 2,766 late applications for consideration resulting in a backlog of applications to the Redress Unit under the Freedom of Information Act.  A dedicated team within my Department deals with these applications.</P>

	<P>On foot of a request from the Committee of Public Accounts for a note in relation to allegations made by the former employee referred to by the Deputy, my Department requested a note from Co. Cork VEC on the matters raised along with appropriate follow up action to resolve each of the matters.</P>
        <P>Co. Cork VEC replied on 23rd April last advising that the former employee concerned is involved in two High Court Proceedings against Co. Cork VEC and that as a result the VEC is not in a position to provide a note at this time.  On foot of this letter, my Department compiled a list of the complaints contained in the correspondence from the former employee concerned.  The list contains 32 complaints and has been agreed by the former employee as being an accurate summary of the complaints.</P>
        <P>On 15th May last, my Department forwarded the list of complaints to the Acting CEO of Co. Cork VEC with a request for the VEC to advise which of the complaints on the list were the subject of legal proceedings and to provide a note on, and to take appropriate action to resolve each of the other complaints.  On 24th May last, the Acting CEO replied advising that Co. Cork VEC is &ldquo;not in a position to or indeed willing to readdress the issues outlined.&rdquo;  The letter briefly set out the history in relation to nine of the complaints which the former employee pursued through the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court, but didn&rsquo;t identify the complaints concerned.  The letter enclosed two letters sent in April 2008 from my Department to the former employee regarding a complaint in relation to her application for a teaching post.</P>
        <P>On 15th June last, the Acting CEO advised my Department that the former employee has lodged a Notice of Appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court judgement dated 11th May 2012.  The Acting CEO also advised that the former employee has lodged a separate appeal against a decision by the Circuit Court not to transfer a claim by her for damages to the High Court.  The Acting CEO also stated that she considered that it would be inappropriate for her to comment further in view of the pending Court Proceedings.  In the circumstances, my Department is not in a position at this time to pursue further enquiries in relation to this matter with Co. Cork VEC.  My Department will, of course, cooperate fully with any request for assistance from the Committee of Public Accounts, any other Oireachtas Committee or from the Comptroller and Auditor General in their enquiries into this matter.</P>

        <Quest> when the policy change came into force which now prohibits qualified parents from providing July provision for their children; the reason behind this decision; the reason a person (details supplied) did not receive adequate notice of this change; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36371/12]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July.  My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.</P>
        <P>Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided in cases where parents have to source and fund a qualified teacher to undertake the tuition.  The cost of home based tuition is then reimbursed to the parents by my Department.</P>
        <P>It has never been an expressed feature of this scheme that parents of a qualifying child, whether they are qualified teachers or otherwise, would qualify to act as the tutor for the purposes of this scheme.  The expectation that parents should source a third party tutor is clear from the terms and conditions provided to applicants.</P>
        <P>This year, my Department has, for clarification purposes, restated the requirement to source a teacher to deliver the home based provision.  In exceptional circumstances where parents have exhausted all other options to secure a qualified teacher, approval may be considered.  Requests for such exceptions have been considered by my officials on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>My Department has taken these steps, this year, to ensure that the scheme is managed prudently and effectively.  An important feature of the scheme is the Department&rsquo;s ability to satisfy itself that the tuition has been delivered in line with the conditions of the scheme and that the substantial grants paid are used for the intended purpose.  This can only be fully achieved by parents verifying that the tuition was delivered and by teachers verifying that they received the payments.</P>
        <P>With regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, the parent in question was advised in mid-June of the need to attempt to source a qualified teacher to undertake the tuition in July.</P>
        <P>However, as an exceptional matter, my officials included approval for her to act as tutor in the event that she was unsuccessful in her endeavours in this regard.</P>

	<P>The charge for children who are eligible for school transport under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Primary School Transport Scheme will be &euro;100 per annum for the 2012/13 school year; the charge for children availing of transport on a concessionary basis will also be &euro;100 per annum for the next school year. </P>
        <P>The corresponding charges for the last school year were &euro;50 and &euro;200 respectively.  As the Deputy will note, the current Government has actually reduced the costs for concessionary school transport.  This will make it more affordable than the rates for the 2011/12 school year which, the Deputy will recall, were set by the previous Fianna Fail &mdash; Green Party government in the December 2010 budget.</P>
        <P>The maximum family charge for children availing of school transport to a primary school is &euro;220 per annum.</P>
        <P>The charge for children who are eligible for school transport under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme remains at &euro;350 per annum for the 2012/13 school year; the charge for children availing of transport on a concessionary basis will also remain at &euro;350 per annum for the next school year.</P>
        <P>The overall family maximum for children availing of school transport services remains at &euro;650 per annum.  Eligible children with valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from these charges.  As with last year, charges may be paid in two instalments in July and December.</P>

	<P>One of the main objectives of the School Transport Scheme is to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible children have a reasonable level of service while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.</P>
        <P>In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann generally plan and timetable school transport services for children who are in attendance for the full school day. Children in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day.  This is a concession in the interests of young children and allows for a perceived inability on their part to sustain the work of the full day. It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether the concession should be applied in the case of the school or not. It is also a matter for the managerial authorities to arrange adequate supervision for children while they are on the school premises.</P>
        <P>The annual charge for school transport is a contribution towards the overall cost and does not reflect the true cost of providing these services.</P>

	<P>My Department undertook a survey of schools to establish the position regarding school book rental and loan schemes for the school year 2011/12.  This survey was completed in early 2012. </P>
        <P>The 3300 primary and special schools nationwide were asked in their annual returns to my Department if they operated a textbook or loan scheme in 2011/12 to enable pupils to rent or borrow some or all of their main books.  Approximately 99% of the schools responded and 2519 schools, which represents 76% of primary schools, stated that they operated such a scheme.  The results at second level were not as conclusive, as only 44% of the 723 post-primary schools responded to the question in a separate survey.  The number of post-primary schools which had a textbook rental scheme was 230.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have the information on when the schools established their book rental schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 212, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families.  Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers&rsquo; Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.</P>
        <P>The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.</P>
        <P>The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  My Department does not have data to show the price reductions over the last four years, as requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  My Department recently published research which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level.  The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools.  Results at second level are not as conclusive.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to the &ldquo;Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills&rdquo; and the draft &ldquo;Guidelines on Developing School Textbook Rental Schemes&rdquo; which I published at the end of May.  I believe that these documents will help to inform the debate on the issue.  Following receipt of the opinions of the representatives of teachers, principals, school management, parents, students and other on the policy options outlined in the report, I hope to make a decision by the end of the summer so that if there are any changes to the book grant scheme schools will have a year&rsquo;s advance notice.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> if he will outline the educational options available to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </P>
        <P>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) can also assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

	<P>Expenditure on rental of temporary school accommodation (not limited to prefabs) is available from 1998 onwards.</P>
        <P>The following outlines, on a year by year basis, expenditure at primary and post-primary rental since that time: 1998:  &euro;1.3m  1999:  &euro;2.4m 2000:  &euro;4.0m 2001:  &euro;6.1m 2002:  &euro;8.4m 2003:  &euro;9.4m 2004: &euro;11.3m 2005: &euro;15.7m 2006: &euro;24.5m 2007: &euro;35.5m 2008: &euro;53.0m 2009: &euro;39.0m 2010: &euro;29.3m 2011: &euro;28.9m 2012: &euro;29.3m (allocation)</P>
        <P>Information in relation to expenditure on the purchase of prefabricated accommodation for primary and post-primary schools is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department announced a new initiative to replace rented prefabs in March of this year.  Over 170 have been approved to replace rented prefabs with permanent accommodation.  A total of &euro;41.8 million has been allocated for this initiative which will result in approximately 6,000 pupils moving from prefabs into permanent classrooms and resource rooms when building works are completed in all schools.</P>

        <P>There is no scope for reversing these changes as under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget and all these measures, including the ceasing of the catchment boundary system, are an integral part of this.</P>

	<P>Based on the salaries, excluding allowances, of the CEOs of the Vocational Education Committees in 2011, the annual salary saving arising if all CEO salaries were capped at &euro;100,000 would amount to approximately &euro;431,000.  The Deputy should note that the Transport Liaison Officer allowance, which was the main allowance paid to CEOs, costing some &euro;261,000 in 2011, was discontinued with effect from 1 June 2012.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also note that the saving figure does not take into account any additional saving to the State which would arise from a reduction in Employer PRSI, nor does it take account of the loss to the Exchequer arising from a reduction in statutory deductions such as income tax, Employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge.</P>

These figures are VAT inclusive and indexed to inflation.  As well as entering into a contract to design, build and fund the projects, the private sector partner also has responsibility for the maintenance of the buildings and grounds over the life of the contract and to manage and pay for the facilities services such as cleaning and security over that period.  Accordingly, the full contract cost comprises of loan repayments (capital and interest) for the project financing which covers design, construction and equipment, building and equipment life cycle funds and facilities management.  The latter item includes maintenance, cleaning, salaries and sundry expenses.   </P>

	<P>My Department has an allocation of &euro;740,000 in respect of telecommunications services in 2012. This allocation covers the cost of all telecommunications services including fixed voice lines, mobile &ldquo;phones, telephonists. telephone hardware and maintenance. For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, a new VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) telephony system was rolled out across my Department&rsquo;s three main offices in Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore, earlier this year.  The VoIP system facilitates the routing of landline voice calls over the Department&rsquo;s existing data network, realising significant savings in telecommunications costs.  Upon completion of the roll-out of VoIP to my Department&rsquo;s regional and local offices, it is estimated that approximately &euro;250,000 will be saved per annum.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to driving reforms to radically reduce costs across the public service whilst improving service and strengthening the fiscal position of the economy.  The Higher Education sector in particular has a strong track record in establishing shared services and some of these are now well established brands, including HEAnet and the CAO.  There are a number of projects underway in the sector in the south including the increased use of aggregated and shared procurement which are delivering savings for the institutions.  There is also significant potential for further cost savings and efficiencies through greater collaboration with institutions in Northern Ireland.  At the recent North South Ministerial meeting in June, Ministers discussed the importance of co-operation on third level education, taking account of the likely increase in student mobility between both jurisdictions and the importance of continuing collaborative action between third level institutions to assist with cost savings and also in the area of research and development activities.  My Department is working with counterparts in Northern Ireland to progress work in this area.</P>

        <P>In dealing with the Troika on this matter, it has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that funds released from the disposals would be used to support job creating initiatives in the economy.  After a series of negotiations, I have reached agreement with the Troika that all of the Government&rsquo;s proceeds from the asset disposals will be available, in one shape or another, to support job creating initiatives in the economy.  Half of the proceeds will be available to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature.  The other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, will, in the first instance, be constituted as a fund to underpin additional lending into Ireland, for example by the EIB, in support of further investment in job-creating initiatives.</P>

	<P>As part of the Croke Park Agreement management and staff representatives have agreed to work together to deliver increased productivity and maximise efficiencies in the delivery of public services.  It is estimated that the cost of sick leave across the public service is over &euro;500m.  The State is no longer in a financial position to be able to sustain the cost of the existing sick leave arrangements in the public service. It is the view of public service management that a reduction in the amount of paid sick leave across the public service will result in increased productivity, a reduction in the cost of sick leave and improved morale.  Therefore management has made proposals to reduce the arrangements for paid sick leave across the public service.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission facilitated discussions between the management side and the public service unions on proposals to change sick leave provisions across the public service.  Agreement was not reached on all of the proposals and therefore the Labour Court is currently considering the matter. The final extent of the changes to the sick leave provisions will not be determined until this process has been completed.</P>

	<P>Public servants serving before April 2004 are generally not &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and most have a compulsory retirement age of 65.  Other than certain uniformed groups, public servants recruited since then do not have a compulsory retirement age.  Public servants may retire earlier than this age, for example, on medical grounds, on cost-neutral (or actuarially reduced) grounds or on attaining the pension age (that is the age at which one may retire and immediately receive a pension) for their public service occupation.  The pension age for many public servants is age 60.</P>
        <P>For the majority of public servants who are fully insured for social insurance purposes, the occupational benefit is integrated with the State Pension (Contributory), that is, the occupational public service pensions of fully insured public servants reflect that the person and the public service employer pay social insurance contributions which will usually qualify the person for the State Pension (Contributory).</P>
        <P>Where the retiring public servant does not receive the State Pension (Contributory), a supplementary pension may be payable under the particular public service pension scheme to bridge the gap; for example, where an unemployed former public servant of pension age, due to causes outside of his or her control, does not have an entitlement to social welfare benefits or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  Concerned individuals should address any enquiries on this to their employing body.</P>

	<P>The <i>Public Service Agreement 2010-2014</i>  is a key strategic framework which is enabling the Government to significantly reduce public service costs and to fundamentally reform the way the public service works with the co-operation of staff.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body for the Agreement has published two annual reports to date.  Both of these reports show clearly that the Agreement is delivering on its objectives and that it continues to make an important contribution to economic recovery.  For example, the Body&rsquo;s second report published on 13 June found, <i>inter alia</i>  , that:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />The Agreement continues to be an effective enabler for the implementation of required reform and change across the public service. It is facilitating a significant reduction in staff numbers and is allowing significant restructuring to be implemented in a climate of sustained industrial relations stability and staff co-operation;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />The Agreement has succeeded in delivering significant Exchequer pay bill savings and non-pay administrative efficiency savings directly related to many of the plans implemented under it.  An estimated &euro;810m in sustainable pay bill savings has been achieved during the first two years of the Agreement and some &euro;678m in non-pay or administrative efficiency savings; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />A broad range of reform initiatives have been progressed both centrally and locally across the public service in such areas as redeployment, revised roster arrangements and work practice changes, reconfiguration of services and rationalization of offices and structures and the introduction of streamlined, centralised and shared service arrangements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has welcomed the progress that has been made to date but has also called on the parties to intensify their efforts over the coming period to accelerate the implementation of priority reform measures under the Agreement and to explore all opportunities for extracting further pay bill and non-pay administrative efficiency savings given the challenges the country continues to face.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body will undertake its next review of the savings and reform being enabled under the Agreement in spring 2013.  The Agreement is set over a four year period from 2010 to 2014.  There are no discussions currently envisaged in relation to a successor Agreement.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his plan for voluntary redundancies in the public sector; his further plans to ensure that senior critical persons do not retire; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that significant progress is being made in reducing the numbers employed in the Public Service.  The numbers working in the public service have continued to fall, with the provisional outturn for Quarter 1 2012 standing at 292,000.  This is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008.</P>
        <P>However, in order to reach the Government&rsquo;s numbers target of 282,500 by 2015 all Departments/Offices have been requested to look at radically different models of public service delivery, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s Reform Agenda.  Departments/Offices will also have to critically examine the priority services that will be required in the future.  Schemes, programmes and bodies which can be radically altered, curtailed or eliminated entirely should be identified.</P>
        <P>We are considering a range of measures including the potential use of targeted exit mechanism schemes such as voluntary redundancy in instances where staff surpluses are identified.  In the event of voluntary redundancy being introduced, the terms of the <i>Collective agreement on redundancy payments to Public Servants</i> would apply.  These terms are similar to those offered in the recent past to staff in the HSE and Teagasc.  It is important to make clear that voluntary redundancy is not a right and it would be a matter for the Minister and senior management of each Department/Office to select suitable candidates, grades, locations or skills for either inclusion or exclusion from a proposed scheme.</P>
        <P>Finally, in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about retirements, it should be noted that it is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan within existing resources for current and ongoing staffing requirements, including retirements.  Staff cannot be prohibited from retiring once they have reached pensionable age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the Valuation Act 2001, a national programme is being rolled out progressively for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State.  The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates.  The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities.  It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in values and rents following the economic downturn of recent years.</P>
        <P>The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values.  Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability.  Even though property values have fallen generally, some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government supports a strong policy of pay restraint in the public sector and in 2011 introduced a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum in the case of newly appointed CEOs in this sector and sought voluntary reductions from incumbent CEOs whose salaries were in excess of this pay ceiling. </P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce a unilateral pay ceiling of &euro;100,000 per annum for CEOs of Commercial State Companies.  However, if such a cap were to be introduced no direct savings would accrue to the State.  The savings to the Commercial State Companies would be approximately &euro;2.5m per annum if all current CEO salaries were capped at &euro;100,000 per annum.</P>

	<P>The table below details the information requested by the Deputy with regard to a breakdown of the 1.730m Reform Agenda budget 2012 allocation in relation to my Department. </P>
        <P>The Reform Agenda Fund is used to support the cost of implementing initiatives related to the reform of the Public Service, and specifically the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published last November.</P>
        <P>The Reform Agenda Fund 2012 is supporting the Reform and Delivery Office and related areas of my Department in the delivery of the reform programme across the Public Service.  It is also being used to support the work of the Public Service Agreement Implementation Body and the Senior Public Service.</P>
        <P>There is sometimes a need to invest in change, in order to support increased efficiency and effectiveness, and to reduce costs in the medium to longer term, and that is the purpose of this funding.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy was advised on 31 January last the Government is committed to a programme of public service reform and improvement.  As part of the work in this area, we are looking at classifications and listings of State Agencies in order to produce more coherent and focused directories of services for citizens and the Oireachtas. </P>
        <P>Broadly the position is that there are firstly a number of offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group.  Secondly there are non-commercial state bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department.</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department there are two non-commercial state bodies or State Agencies.  These are the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) and the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).  There is no direct cost to the Exchequer in respect of the IPA as it runs as a Limited Company however my Department does pay out a grant-in-aid which for 2012 was set at &euro;2.75 million.  The SEUPB is a North/South Body established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It is jointly sponsored by my Department and the Northern Ireland Dept of Finance and Personnel.  My Department and the NI Dept of Finance and Personnel both contribute to the Body&rsquo;s running costs; the cost to the Irish Exchequer in 2012 is &euro;1.197m.</P>

	<P>I announced yesterday, 17 July 2012, the Government&rsquo;s &euro;2&frac14; billion Infrastructure Stimulus Package which will provide investment in a range of important and much needed new projects.  Details in relation to the funding of the package and timeframes for delivery of the projects can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.per.gov.ie</i>).</P>
        <P>The Government is already committed to spending &euro;3,962 million in capital investment this year and a total of &euro;17 billion over the next five years.  This Exchequer investment package was set out last November in the &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; which outlined the five year Exchequer Capital Framework out to 2016.  The Framework was published following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme led by my Department.  It sets out a significant programme of Exchequer investment over the next five years, and is designed to address critical infrastructure deficits, aid economic growth and provide much needed social infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The package announced yesterday is additional to the investment outlined in the Exchequer Framework and will be largely predicated on using non-Exchequer sources of funding to support the first Phase of a new PPP Programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure.  It is envisaged that enabling works on some of the PPP projects announced yesterday will begin in 2013 and these works will be funded from some of the proceeds of the sale of State Assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery.</P>

This is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008.</P>
        <P>However, in order to reach the Government&rsquo;s numbers target of 282,500 by 2015 all Departments/Offices have been requested to look at radically different models of public service delivery, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s Reform Agenda.  Departments/Offices will also have to critically examine the priority services that will be required in the future. Schemes, programmes and bodies which can be radically altered, curtailed or eliminated entirely should be identified.</P>
        <P>We are considering a range of measures including the potential use of targeted exit mechanism schemes in instances where staff surpluses are identified.  In the event of voluntary redundancy being introduced, the terms of the <i>Collective agreement on redundancy payments to Public Servants</i> would apply.  These terms are similar to those offered in the recent past to staff in the HSE and Teagasc.  It is important to make clear that voluntary redundancy is not a right and it would be a matter for the Minister and senior management of each Department/Office to select suitable candidates, grades, locations or skills for either inclusion or exclusion from a proposed scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the Public Service Reform Plan, published in November last year, demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform and the pursuit of efficiencies by deciding (i) to proceed with the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012 and (ii) the critical review of a further 46 bodies by the end of June 2012.  Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the progress made on the rationalisation of the 48 bodies by end 2012, while my Department is monitoring progress on the implementation of these measures on a quarterly basis, questions regarding the approach and progress of individual measures is a matter for each Department and should therefore be directed to the relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>In terms of my own Department, the Government decided in the Public Service Reform Plan that that the Commission on Public Service Appointments should be merged with the Office of the Ombudsman.  This merger took place on an administrative basis with effect from 1 October 2011.  It is envisaged that the necessary legislative measures to give full statutory effect to the merger will be included in an Ombudsman Amendment Bill, proposals for which are being prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>Regarding the critical reviews of 46 bodies, my Department is considering the responses received to date by Departments.  Following this consideration I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government requesting a decision on how best to proceed with the implementation of the rationalisation programme.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, Minister Hayes signalled to the House his intention to bring proposals to Government on Committee Stage amendments dealing issues that would include:</P>
        <P>Thresholds:  In order to ensure that the legislation applies to the majority of Construction Contracts the scope of the legislation will be broadened by reducing or removing the current monetary thresholds contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Adjudication: This issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors is a complex issue.  It is important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.</P>
        <P>When these and a number of other issues have been examined, Minister Hayes will bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage which is expected to take place early in the next D&aacute;il session. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists and rules governing the conduct of lobbying. The fundamental objective of this commitment, which guides the proposed policy approach, is to ensure that there is an appropriate degree of transparency regarding lobbying activity.</P>
        <P>The timeline for this approach is contained in the Public Service Reform Plan 2011 which contains a commitment to prepare legislation to meet these objectives in 2012 with planned publication of a Bill early in 2013. In line with this commitment my Department is currently progressing its consultation with stakeholders and it is intended to present Heads of a Bill to Government in the Autumn.  I have already indicated that I will then submit the Heads of the Bill to the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee for its consideration.</P>
        <P>The list of stakeholders who responded to the consultation process is attached and is also available on my Departments website together with the submissions received.</P>
        <P>I published a policy paper on 4th July last setting out the key issues and my Department&rsquo;s proposals for progressing the legislative arrangements. I will also shortly be publishing on the website the outcome of consultations at the recent conference on lobbying held at Farmleigh on 5th July last. I would very much welcome further views on the policy paper. Anyone, whether an individual or body, who wishes to engage in the consultation process can do so by contacting the Government Reform Unit of my Department.</P>

	<P>As part of the Public Service Reform Plan, my Department is examining ways to improve collaborative procurement arrangements across the public service. Where feasible such arrangements could include an all-island approach to procuring certain commonly acquired goods and services.  The development of an increased supplier base on an all-island basis has the potential to deliver procurement savings from increased competition. In this regard, the main procurement and development bodies on the island, with ministerial support, are assisting the SME sector in accessing the all-island &euro;20bn public procurement market. Such assistance includes the hosting of &ldquo;<i>Meet-the-Buyer&rdquo; </i>events by Intertrade Ireland, along with the National Procurement Service, Enterprise Ireland and their counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Central Procurement Directorate, the Strategic Investment Board and Invest Northern Ireland.  These workshops, two of which have already been held, in November 2011 in Dundalk and May 2012 in Athlone, have been successful in attracting small and medium-sized enterprises, with over 400 SMEs attending the Athlone event.  These events are targeted at fostering increased SME participation in tendering for public goods and service contracts.  Two further workshops will take place this year in Cookstown in September and Kilkenny in November. </P>

	<P>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that data in relation to site visits is maintained on a county by county basis only.  The Agency has indicated to me that over the period 2003 to date there have been 231 IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to Limerick City and County.  Details of the number of such visits in each of the years in question are set out in the attached tabular statement.  Enterprise Ireland, who deal with indigenous industry, do not arrange similar type promotional visits.</P>
        <P>There are 44 IDA Ireland supported companies in Limerick, City and County employing over 6,000 people. Enterprise Ireland works with over 260 clients in Limerick City and County who employ 6,175 full time employees.</P>
        <P>One of the high level goals in IDA&rsquo;s Strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; is a commitment that in the period 2012 to 2014, 50% of all Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  In seeking to meet this target within the context of securing high quality FDI for Ireland, IDA Ireland has pointed out that the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  IDA also promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.</P>
        <P>Typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements and, in certain cases, other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis.  In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities are focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of jobs in existing companies, and, in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together. </P>
        <P>I have announced my intention to integrate Forfas into my Department to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy.  The proposal is not driven by the objective of finding cost savings, although some savings may arise in due course if synergies between the two organisations are identified.  I do not envisage any reduction in job numbers as a result of the integration.</P>
        <P>I very much value the independent nature of the research and advice that Forfas has provided to me since I came in to office.  I do not intend this independent thinking to be diminished by the integration process.  Forfas&rsquo;s policy and research functions will form the core of a new Strategic Policy Division in my Department.  This Division will be tasked with a significant range of policy evaluation, coordination and planning functions.  The senior management teams of both my Department and Forf&aacute;s are committed to ensuring that the integration is operationalised in a way that maximises the outcomes in terms of both developing and implementing enterprise policy.</P>
        <P>An Implementation Group, comprising senior management from my Department, Forfas, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is overseeing the integration project and will consider all of the legislative, financial and staffing implications that arise from the exercise.  A project of this nature would typically take up to 18 months for completion.</P>

        <P>Recent results announced by the Agency show that good progress is being made in reaching this target and that the strong flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) is continuing as, at mid-year, there had been over 5,000 new job announcements by IDA client companies, with almost half of these in locations outside of Dublin and Cork. IDA&rsquo;s job announcement list is available on its website.</P>
        <P>Globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging but IDA Ireland has assured me that it is optimistic that Ireland can continue to win significant FDI, building on its track record.  IDA Ireland is continuing to target a number of sectors that will continue to grow, even in a globally challenging environment.  These include IT/ Technology, Digital Media and Lifesciences.  Even in areas of low or no growth, the Agency is confident that FDI opportunities will arise in sectors such as the consolidation of technology and operations hubs in global financial institutions and consolidation of operations in a number of other sectors.</P>

	<P>The full year jobs target set for Enterprise Ireland is for 6,250 job commitments by client companies and EI is on track to meet this target.  A total of 3,716 job commitments linked to EI approvals to client companies have been secured in the first half of 2012. </P>
        <P>Employment data for Enterprise Ireland is collected annually as part of the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey.  The 2012 job creation results for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies will be available in December 2012.</P>
        <P>The outlook for net new job creation in 2012 is positive, although significant challenges remain such as uncertainty in international markets.  The first annual Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 actions to be implemented by all 15 Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies, and is intended to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.</P>
        <P>The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is the first instalment in a multi-year process which aims to deliver on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, and increase the number of people at work in Ireland by 100,000, from 1.8 million to 1.9 million, by 2016.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has a crucial role in the implementation of the plan and therefore will continue to be at the forefront of job creation for exporting indigenous companies. My Departmental Officials meet regularly with EI to monitor and discuss performance against agreed metrics and as part of the process of supporting the agency in its work.</P>
        <P>I meet regularly with EI at board and executive levels.  I am actively involved in and have had first-hand experience of their operations and the work of their personnel on the ground through various company events and the trade missions which I have led since my appointment as Minister</P>
        <P>The close working relationship between my Department and EI will be strengthened with the introduction of a detailed Service Level Agreement between my Department and the agency which is currently being drafted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The mandate of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is to develop Ireland&rsquo;s human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavour relevant to the future competitiveness of Irish industry and enterprise.  It carries out this task by funding world-class research teams in our higher education institutions focussing on the areas of information and communications technologies, biotechnology and sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies. </P>
        <P>The core outputs of SFI&rsquo;s activities are the range of world-class research teams in place, with indicators of their international rankings, taking into account the extent of their linkages with other research groups and with industry partners and the amount of funding leveraged from other sources.</P>
        <P>While direct job support is not the core task of SFI, it should be noted that at the end of 2011 SFI funding was directly supporting 2,995 top-class research positions across Irish higher education institutions and these researchers leveraged &euro;90m in non-Exchequer funding to Ireland last year.</P>
        <P>A major impact attributable to SFI has been, and continues to be, its underpinning role for the enterprise and job creation activities of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI). SFI funded research activities are focal points of attraction for foreign direct investment in Ireland whilst also assisting the EI client base to maintain and grow employment levels, and also enhance their sales and exports capacity.</P>
        <P>In 2011 the SFI funded research teams collaborated with 583 distinct companies, the majority of which are EI and IDA clients and which employ in excess of an estimated 82,000 people in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years the SFI investment has helped to significantly enhance IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new client wins capacity.  This can be evidenced by the fact that in 2004 the value of the foreign direct investment approvals achieved by the IDA that were research, development and innovation (RD&amp;I) based amounted to &euro;120m whilst the comparable 2011 level was &euro;700m, a level nearly six times greater.  This is a significant indicator of the strong research capacity that SFI, along with other research funders, has helped to develop in Ireland in recent years.</P>
        <P>Through the quality of our human capital and the excellence of our research, Ireland has succeeded in attracting some of the most innovative companies in the world. For example:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />9 of the Top 10 Pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations here.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Similarly 15 of the Top 25 Medical Devices companies now have operations in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />As do 8 of the Top 10 global Technology companies; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />10 of the world&rsquo;s top selling drugs are produced in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In terms of SFI activity in 2012, the capital funding provision of &euro;156m this year will allow the Foundation to maintain its support to 28 top-class research centres whilst also supporting a cohort of approximately 3,000 researcher positions.</P>

	<P>In 2011, there were 7,253 jobs created in companies supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), while the number of jobs existing in CEB supported companies for the three years 2008-2010 were 33,811, 30726.5 and 32,910 respectively.  These figures cover the period when the economy was experiencing very severe economic difficulties, during which period there were significant job losses as well as job gains.  Overall, the figures demonstrate the resilience of the CEBs and their client companies in maintaining and created jobs in the micro-enterprise sector during a very challenging period. </P>
        <P>It has not been the practice to set specific job creation targets for each CEB. However, the Deputy will be aware that the Government recently approved the restructuring of the way in which the State supports the micro and small business sector.  As a result, the 35 CEBs will be dissolved and supports to the micro-enterprise sector will be delivered through Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to be established in Local Authorities.  These LEOs will deliver their supports to business to a robust set of targets and performance measurements.  These targets, which will be determined following comprehensive analysis of the full potential of the new micro-enterprise support model, will be ambitious and will aim to stretch LEOs to make a significantly improved contribution to economic recovery at local level.</P>

	<P>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are autonomous agencies with statutory obligations to, in the case of IDA Ireland, attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to this country and its regions and, in the case of Enterprise Ireland, to develop indigenous industry and to secure opportunities for those industries in international markets and thereby increase employment in this country.</P>
        <P>There are 16 IDA Ireland client companies in Co. Meath employing approximately 1,300 people while 172 Enterprise Ireland client companies employ 5,120 people in that county.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.  The Action Plan contains 270 measures for delivery across all Government Departments and 36 agencies which will support job creation in this and future years.  While specific job targets have not been set for individual locations, the enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department are working closely with one another and with other state agencies to deliver the job creation targets which have been set.</P>
        <P>2011 saw a strong performance in the level of FDI won by Ireland.  IDA client companies created over 13,000 new jobs in 2011, up 20% on the previous year.  There was an overall increase of 17% in the number of investments from IDA client companies in 2011 and, despite the current global economic situation and a strong increase in international competition, there was a record number of 148 new investments won during the year across all industry segments.  Of the 148 FDI investments made in 2011, a record number of 61 were from multinational companies investing in Ireland for the first time (an increase of 30%) while 87 were made by existing client companies (46 expansions and 41 R&amp;D investments).  FDI is now responsible for 1 in 7 jobs in the Economy.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Action Plan for Jobs IDA Ireland has been set a very challenging target to create 12,500 jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250 in 2012.  Recent results announced by the Agency show that good progress is being made in reaching this target and that the strong flow of FDI is continuing as, at mid year, there had been over 5,000 new job announcements by IDA client companies, with almost half of these in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.</P>
        <P>Globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, but there are still investment opportunities in global markets.  IDA Ireland has assured me that it is optimistic that Ireland can continue to win significant FDI, building on its strong track record. IDA is targeting a number of sectors that will continue to grow even in a globally challenging environment. These include IT/Technology, Digital Media and Life sciences.  Even in areas of low or no growth, FDI opportunities will arise in sectors such as the consolidation of technology and operations hubs in global financial institutions and consolidation of operations in a number of other sectors.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, initiated a consultation process to discuss potential changes to the sick pay scheme in Ireland.  </P>
        <P>Forf&aacute;s and representatives from my Department attended the consultative seminar held by the Minister, along with a number of business representative organisations.  I understand that the Minister for Social Protection recently published a report on the consultation seminar.</P>
        <P>I have not held discussions with the Department of Social Protection or any other Department on the issue.  Any proposals for changes to the sick scheme would be a matter for the Budgetary process, which will be considered in due course by the Government.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns raised by employer representatives that transferring responsibility for the payment of employees&rsquo; sick pay to employers would add to the cost of doing business.  In this context, any such proposals would impact on competitiveness and employment.  The evidence of this impact will need to be weighed against the potential for savings in terms of reduced absences due to sickness.</P>
        <P>I will carefully scrutinise any proposals which develop from this consultation phase and their impact on jobs and competitiveness, and I will contribute fully to the Budgetary process within Government.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was formally reviewed by my Department through Forfas which commissioned an expert report by consultants Georgia Tech in 2001 to examine the case for Irish participation in a number of intergovernmental research organisations including CERN.  That Report concluded that because of high costs and limited industrial development returns membership should not be pursued at that time.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources which this Government inherited has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country &mdash; most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations is reviewed on a regular basis and in the case of the European Space Agency, for example, the value of membership in terms of support to Irish companies and researchers is considered to justify the costs of our membership.</P>
        <P>CERN is a major international project which deservedly has received much attention in recent weeks arising from major and exciting discoveries.  It is important to note that Irish researchers are not precluded from participating in and benefiting from the work being done at CERN.  In an ideal world, of course it would be desirable to be involved in this major project, based in Europe as it is.  The issue is whether we should divert very scarce, and in most cases committed funding, away from the areas that we had identified as having the best chance of contributing to our economic recovery.  The costs of full membership are understood to be over &euro;10m per annum.  While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  Should budgetary circumstances change the matter could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost/benefit viewpoint.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the system for resolving individual disputes related to the workplace is in need of reform.  The current system is wasteful, both in terms of state resources and those of the users.  It is also frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  The system has been the subject of much analysis involving eight reports in as many years.  Some of the criticisms of the system outlined in these reports include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Five organisations with overlapping, but completely separate, objectives and operations.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />So complex that even experienced practitioners find it difficult to comprehend.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Claims are often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute: they sometimes become statute barred before the error is discovered.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Lack of consistency between, and in some cases, within the bodies regarding the degree of formality of hearings, rules of evidence and the use of adversarial or inquisitorial procedures.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Overly legalistic with many users feeling the need to incur legal expenses.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A set of circumstances arising in respect of a single employee and single employer can give rise to a number of claims, which must be processed through different fora to obtain redress.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Different routes of appeal can apply for issues arising out of the same set of circumstances in the same employment.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Irrational and inequitable variations in how compensation is calculated and in remedies available &mdash; no reasons are given for decisions in some cases.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Duplication of functions between the bodies results in &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Delays are excessive.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Poor value for money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is universal acceptance of the need for major reform of the current processes. It was for this reason that I announced my intention to undertake a root-and-branch reform of the State&rsquo;s complex Workplace Relations systems in July 2011.  I indicated that my aim was to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service.</P>
        <P>I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale.</P>
        <P>These include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; has replaced the five separate entry points.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within five working days of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The employer is also notified, on average, within five working days of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A new workplace relations interim website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i> is in place.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My intention is to continue to progress the reform programme.  The next major step is to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  The WRC will replace the LRC, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT.  The labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.</P>
        <P>While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation . This is necessary in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes. Last year I undertook a public consultation process that concluded in September 2011. The responses, overall, demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take.  The many positive suggestions that emerged from that process have helped to inform the design and delivery of the reform to date. They also influenced the proposals set out in the <i>Blueprint to Deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations Service</i> (<i>Blueprint</i> ) which I published in April of this year. The Blueprint document set out, in considerable detail, how I propose to reform the workplace relations structures and processes. I published the Blueprint in order to provide a further opportunity for consultation.  I am happy to have received 32 responses to the document.  They include many supportive, useful and constructive suggestions and comments. All contributions made have received careful consideration and helped inform the preparation of the Policy Document &mdash; <i>Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service </i>which I recently submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation. I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of the document.  All of these documents including most of the submissions received in response to the consultations are available on the Workplace Relations Website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I am proceeding with the reform process and I am committed to delivering a world-class workplace relations service.  My aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, accessible and workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  The system must operate to the highest standards and earn the confidence of employers, employees and all who will use its services.</P>
        <P>Work has commenced on the legislative programme and detailed design to deliver the reform.  I will shortly be seeking Government approval for priority drafting of the Workplace Relations Bill to give legislative effect to the reform programme.</P>

	<P>In January 2012 Diageo announced it is to invest &euro;153m in a brewing centre of excellence at the Guinness brewery at St James&rsquo;s Gate in Dublin.  In conjunction with this investment, the company decided to close the two smaller breweries in Dundalk and Kilkenny with the loss of 110 jobs.  The decision to close the two breweries was made by the company on the basis that there is no economic rationale for maintaining two separate facilities not operating at full capacity, with duplication of roles.  The Dundalk site is scheduled to close in June 2013 and the Kilkenny site in December 2013.</P>
        <P>The company had originally announced the decision to close the two facilities and centralise its brewing activities in St. James Gate in 2008.</P>
        <P>I understand that, since the planned closure announcements, a number of employees have taken up roles either inside or outside Diageo and their positions have generally been backfilled by people on short term contracts.  This process will continue until the closures take place.</P>
        <P>I understand that it is envisaged that there will be a number of voluntary redundancies while the remainder will gain positions either inside or outside Diageo.  Diageo are currently working with employees to help each individual find their own best fit position.</P>
        <P>Discussions on a number of issues arising from the company&rsquo;s decision to close the two plants are ongoing between Diageo and the trade unions representing the workers. These talks are being facilitated through the State&rsquo;s Industrial Relations Machinery.  I would encourage all parties to engage constructively and in good faith in this process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.</P>

        <Quest> the recent consultations he has had with the Industrial Development Agency to prioritise the IDA Business Park at Marlinstown, Mullingar; the number of visits he has had with potential clients to date in 2012; his plans or targets to incentivise business to come to this fully equipped, state of the art and fully services business park. </Quest>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the Agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to this country and its regions.  IDA Ireland has informed me that it has invested significantly in developing its Business and Technology Park in Mullingar in order to make it attractive to overseas clients.  The Agency continues to promote this Park and other local private property solutions to secure new investments for Mullingar and its surrounding areas through its network of overseas offices. </P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has also confirmed that, to date in 2012, there have been 6 IDA sponsored site visits by potential investors to Co. Westmeath.  There are 44 IDA Ireland supported companies in the Midlands Region, employing over 4,600 people.  3 of these IDA client companies are located in Mullingar.  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute from within the Midlands Gateway and IDA considers a project win in one Midlands town to have a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations.</P>
        <P>One of the high level goals in IDA&rsquo;s Strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; is a commitment that in the period 2012 to 2014, 50% of all Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  In seeking to meet this target within the context of securing high quality FDI for Ireland, IDA Ireland has pointed out that the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, essential physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional support services.  There is intense and continual international competition to win FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million i.e. London, Manchester, Boston and Los Angeles.  Ireland has only one Metro City Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA Ireland focuses on marketing Gateway locations within each Region and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  However, in the final analysis, it is the investor who decides where to visit and where to locate.</P>
        <P>Globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, but there are still investment opportunities in global markets.  IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to compete vigorously for these projects for Ireland and will continue to promote the Midlands Region, which includes Mullingar.</P>

	<P>The location and functions of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s staff are day to day operational matters for the Agency and not ones in which I have a function. It is essential that IDA Ireland has authority to manage its resources, within boundaries agreed with my Department, in order that it can meet its strategic goals.</P>
        <P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that during 2010, a Business Process Transformation Initiative was conducted which examined every role in the organisation in the context of highlighting:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Operational changes that could be implemented to enhance the effective delivery of key objectives, as outlined in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy document, &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020&rdquo;;</i></P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Areas of duplication which could be addressed by improved processes;  and,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Areas where additional IT could be applied to bring about staff savings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following on from that process, IDA Ireland continues to retain an office in Cavan with one full time role concentrating on client facing activities. IDA Ireland has informed me that it works closely with its 33 client companies in the North East Region that currently employ in the region of 2,900 people, of whom over 1,100 are employed in County Cavan.</P>
        <P>I have every confidence in the abilities of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Board and senior management team to manage the resources available to it so as to enable the Agency to continue to win foreign direct investment for this country in the face of strong competition.</P>

	<P>The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. The current priorities for the CEBs are to assist owner/managers in enhancing the survival and sustainability of their businesses in these difficult economic times and to assist people wishing to start their own business.  The CEBs provide a valuable resource for those starting a business both in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support. The Boards deliver a range of tailored programmes and supports through the provision of both financial assistance and non-financial assistance.   </P>
        <P>The forms of financial assistance, which are available from CEBs, subject to certain restrictions and conditional on an agreed business plan, include the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Feasibility/Innovation Grant</i>   (payable up to &euro;20,000 (or 50% S&amp;E, 60% BMW region) of the investment, whichever is the lesser), available to micro-enterprises to assist with the cost of necessary pre-start up studies carried out for the purposes of assessing market interest in/demand for a proposed new product or service, the appropriateness of the associated funding plans, the general viability and sustainability of the venture and assistance with innovation.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Priming Grant</i>   (payable up to 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000 whichever is the lesser) available to micro-enterprises for business start-ups within the first 18 months of start-up.  This can cover all business costs directly attributable to starting a new business (save payments to State Bodies).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Business Expansion/Development Grant</i>   (payable up to 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000 whichever is the lesser) available to micro-enterprises to grow and develop the micro-enterprise.  This can cover all business costs directly attributable to growing and developing a business (save payments to State Bodies).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills.

	<P>Under the Industrial Development Acts, the purchase, disposal or leasing of property by IDA Ireland is an operational matter for the Agency, and not one in which I have a function. I have been informed by IDA Ireland that it recently advertised the sale of a number of land banks nationally including the Cavan Business and Technology Park.  This is in accordance with IDA&rsquo;s strategy to rebalance its property portfolio in the current challenging economic climate.</P>
        <P>IDA has assured me that it would consider opportunities to utilise its property portfolio in Cavan to attract other non-traditional type investments into the region, which do not fall under the general remit of IDA or Enterprise Ireland but which could create investment and employment opportunities.  However, in this connection, I should point out that in keeping with the proper handling of State assets and finance IDA is required to ensure that all property transactions, whether with industry or other parties, are on the basis of current market valuation.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has assured me that it continues to work closely with client companies in Cavan who currently employ over 1,100 people.</P>

	<P>The Gross Exchequer Allocation for 2012 for my Department&rsquo;s Vote is &euro;881.553 million, which is spent across the Department&rsquo;s 3 key Programme Areas.</P>
        <P>Gross expenditure across these Programmes to the end of June amounted to approximately &euro;320 million which is 12% behind profile.  This time-related difference is relative to the original profile prepared at the beginning of the year and is associated mainly with the timing of the drawdown of Capital funds by the enterprise and development agencies and the timing of the commencement of the enterprise Loan Fund Scheme which is expected to be in operation from early autumn.</P>
        <P>My Department maintains an ongoing overview of expenditure and as the year progresses will be reviewing the expected outturn for the year end, with a view to identifying any potential savings or shortfalls on individual Programme lines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of course the case that, in certain circumstances, there may be efficiencies and cost savings in pursuing certain aspects of an all-island approach to economic development and job creation. Tourism is perhaps a good example of a sector that can benefit from all-island scales of economy.  The Government is therefore keen to advance opportunities for mutually beneficial cross-border cooperation in such areas. </P>
        <P>In my own area, a key development has been the establishment of <i>InterTradeIreland </i>  (ITI), one of the North/South Implementation Bodies, established under the Good Friday Agreement.  This Agency is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland with a budget of approx. &euro;10m and operates a range of innovative programmes.</P>
        <P>In addition, close co-operation has been established in particular between <i>Invest NI</i> and <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>. An example of close wider agency cooperation is the Acumen Programme, a key all-island business development programme managed by <i>InterTradeIreland</i> and supported by <i>Enterprise Ireland, Invest NI, FAS, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</i> and the <i>County Enterprise Boards.</i> My Department also provides funding support for <i>Interreg </i>  projects, which are supported by the EU and Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
        <P>We will continue to work diligently with our Northern Ireland counterparts and their agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-border co-operation, as well as through the work of the North South Bodies, and the North South Ministerial Trade and Business Development Council.</P>

	<P>F&Aacute;S continues to co-operate with the training authorities in Northern Ireland to pursue possible potential savings through the implementation of joint training courses for the unemployed in border areas.   An example of one such programme would be the Wider Horizons Programme.  The programme aims to enhance employment opportunities by providing vocational training, work experience and personal development training both at home and overseas to disadvantaged people aged between 18 and 28 years. The Wider Horizons Programme is delivered on behalf of The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) by its joint managing agents, the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) in Northern Ireland and F&Aacute;S in the Republic of Ireland. IFI funds the programme costs with F&Aacute;S and DEL contributing to the training allowance and travel and accommodation costs of participants.   </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 322 together. </P>
        <P>Trade Missions raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile as a world-class supplier of goods and tradable services, and increase awareness of Ireland as a competitive source of world-class expertise and products. They win access for Enterprise Ireland clients to key decision-makers in target sectors and influence foreign investors to use Ireland as a base for new service, manufacturing and R&amp;D activity to serve world markets.</P>
        <P>Government policy is to build on the strength of our existing markets and diversify into new ones.  Ministerial-led Trade Missions are an integral part of this process. They help expand Ireland&rsquo;s exports to existing and new markets and increase our profile as one of the most attractive global locations for mobile investment.</P>
        <P>My Department, its development agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade work closely in designing a yearly schedule of trade missions to meet the ambitious market access aspirations of existing and new exporters. The planned schedule is considered by the Export Trade Council so that the missions are aligned with the priority market objectives set out in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. The Export Trade Council, under the chairmanship of An T&aacute;naiste, monitors performance against the targets set out in that strategy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is tackling unemployment through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers.  </P>
        <P>Both of these strategies are whole of Government, national strategies aimed at creating and sustaining jobs.  The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs and will ensure that local enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.</P>
        <P>In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &euro;5.4 million in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers programme, which focuses on developing a person&rsquo;s entrepreneurial abilities and is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland, is providing &euro;4.25 million in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the programme at a local level.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of New Frontiers at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants have recently been offered a place on Phase 2, which commenced yesterday, 18 July 2012.</P>
        <P>A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres that are funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area, including Partas, Killinarden Enterprise Centre, were successful in securing this funding in 2012.</P>
        <P>The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  In 2011, the Board paid out &euro;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</P>
        <P>Tallaght benefits from being part of Ireland&rsquo;s only Metro City Region and is well equipped to compete for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  Announcements in 2012 include Xilinx and SAP in Citywest, Microsoft in Grange Castle, and Digital Realty Trust in Profile Park, Dublin.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the initiatives being pursued by the State Agencies will ensure the creation of employment opportunities for the Killinarden area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which will provide up to 5,000 short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year when fully operational.  This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht areas, known as the Implementing Bodies. Expressions of interest and applications from community organisations wishing to offer work placement opportunities are managed by the relevant Implementing Body. I have made enquires with respect to the matter raised in this Question and have been advised that the community group concerned has made a request for a T&uacute;s participant to Westmeath Community Development Limited. Unfortunately, Westmeath Community Development Limited has identified a number of factors contributing to the delay in placing persons with this community group.   These factors include the geographical area, willingness of selected participants to co-operate and difficulties of matching skills to the work placement. The Implementing Body has informed me that it will maintain contact with the group to support its operations. Should the community group wish to check the status of their application at anytime, I would advise that they liaise directly with Westmeath Community Development Limited on 044-9348571.</P>

	<P>The only role my Department has in this matter is that the Department of Health send instructions to my Department requesting the transfer of funds to their EFT/Public Bank Accounts for the purposes of making (1) payments to suppliers and (2) salary payments to their staff. My Department transfers the funds to these accounts via the Central Bank. My Department does not operate commercial bank accounts on behalf of the Department of Health.</P>

        <Quest> if she will confirm who is entitled to register a death under the Civil Registration Act 2004; if she will also confirm that it is not the case that the Civil Registration Office, Adelaide Street, County Cork, will only allow no one other than a blood relative to register a death for the first 90 days after the death has occurred, which appears to be the case and not in keeping with the Act; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The registration of deaths in Ireland is governed by the provisions of Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 and section 37 (1) of the Act places a duty upon a relative (by blood or by marriage) of the deceased to attend at the office of a registrar, within 3 months of the death, in order to register the required particulars.</P>
        <P>If it is the case that no relative, who has knowledge of the required particulars in relation to the death, and who is capable of acting, exists, or cannot be found, then it is open to any other qualified informant to effect registration. If, after 3 months since the death have elapsed, no relative has acted, the Superintendent Registrar may request any other qualified informant to register the death.</P>
        <P>Aside from relatives, the Act specifies the following as qualified informants:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a person present at the death,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />any other person who has knowledge of the required particulars,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />if the death occurred in a building used as a dwelling or a part of a building so used, any person who was in the building or part at the time of the death,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />if the death occurred in a hospital or other institution or in a building or a part of a building occupied by any other organisation or enterprise, the chief officer of the institution, organisation or enterprise (by whatever name called) or a person authorised by the chief officer to perform his or her functions,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a person who found the body of the person concerned,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a person who took charge of that body,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the person who procured the disposal of that body, or</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />any other person who has knowledge of the death.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Act provides for a hierarchy of qualified informants. Relatives of the deceased are first in the hierarchy and it is only if a relative is unavailable to register the death that the responsibility devolves to non-relatives. The purpose of the provisions is to ensure that the most extensive and complete particulars are given to registrars, on the basis that these would be best known by relatives of the deceased.</P>
        <P>Prior to the commencement of the provisions of the Act relating to deaths, in December 2005, many deaths were registered by hospital staff, general practitioners, nursing home staff and other qualified informants who, in most cases, possessed less knowledge of the deceased&rsquo;s particulars than would a relative. As such, many registrations were incomplete and this was a source of understandable concern to the surviving family members and it is for this reason that a duty to register was placed upon relatives.</P>
        <P>In addition, the period for registration was extended to 3 months, which is the standard period for registration of life events provided for by the Act. As the death of a relative is a traumatic occasion, it was felt that retaining the previous period of 5 days would be insensitive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 and 335 together. </P>
        <P>The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009. The &euro;100 rate does not apply certain categories of claimant including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />claimants with a qualified child;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those making a claim for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring directly to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance from Disability Allowance;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</P>
        <P>Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.   While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</P>
        <P>I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  Officials from the Department met with Focus Ireland in May 2012 in relation to their concerns. These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</P>
        <P>More generally, Deputies may wish to note that the Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</P>

        <P>A person may qualify for payment of BSCFA in respect of a qualified child or children if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive payment, or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.</P>

	<P>Child benefit is a universal payment, whose primary objectives are to assist parents and others in meeting the cost associated with raising children and in contributing towards alleviating child poverty. It is recognised that this payment is an important source of income for all families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment, and plays an important part in the ability of households with children to meet their ongoing needs. Furthermore, the payment is provided in a way that provides parents with the flexibility to determine how this benefit might best be used in the interest of their children. </P>
        <P>With regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, I had stated at the time that targeted promotions of cheap alcohol are inappropriate where they divert badly needed funds from children and families. I note from media reports that the company in question said that the promotion was not part of a national marketing plan or promotional strategy and had instructed the retailers involved to withdraw the promotion.</P>

	<P>The Pathways to Work policy is designed to support people currently on the live register to access jobs available in the market place. It is focused on providing for more regular and on-going engagement with the unemployed, greater targeting of activation places and opportunities; incentivising the take up of opportunities, incentivising employer to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed and reforming institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed. </P>
        <P>A key element of the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy is the establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service.  The establishment of the NEES is currently underway integrating employment and benefit payment services within the Department.</P>
        <P>The first step in establishing the NEES was integrating staff from F&Aacute;S, the Community Welfare Service and the Department.  This integration, which involved the transfer of over 1700 staff was completed on schedule in January of this year.  It facilitates the delivery of a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service to clients and greatly simplifies the process whereby clients previously had to apply to three separate organisations for welfare and employment services.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service is currently being piloted in four of the Department&rsquo;s offices and will be extended to a further ten offices by the year end.  As part of this service, clients can receive a single decision on their welfare entitlements, are assessed to determine their employment services requirements and, following assessment, attend a group interview with subsequent one to one interviews. Clients who do not engage with the process are placed on a penalty rate of payment.</P>
        <P>Pathways to Work sets out a detailed service model which outlines the approach to be taken with each client type.  These include measures such as profiling, group engagement and the application of penalty rates. In total the Department has now profiled 15,000 claimants and initial results indicate that the profiling approach is robust. In 2012 to date approximately 30,700 people have had the benefit of group engagements and attendance rates at subsequent one to one interviews have improved significantly. In addition jobseekers who refuse to attend a group engagement are now subject to a penalty rate of payments.</P>
        <P>In order to progress the Pathways to Work policies and to ensure that there is a cross-cutting approach to meeting the key targets the following structures are in now place: an Interdepartmental Programme Board has been established including senior officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.</P>
        <P>Measures to deliver on the programme of activity outlined in Pathways to work are continually being developed and implemented as it represents a multi annual and ambitious programme of work to assist people re-enter the workforce.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354, 356 and 377 together. </P>
        <P>The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.</P>
        <P>A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme. These include the extent of coverage; the duration of payment; the rate of payment; compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate; and how to ensure that a scheme of statutory sick pay would be enforced and policed.</P>
        <P>The impact of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme would be contingent on how all of these issues are addressed and how such a scheme would ultimately be structured.  I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers and in particular with regard to employment retention and costs to business. A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism in the private sector indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add about &euro;1 per week per employee to the costs of employment</P>
        <P>I hosted a consultative seminar attended by a broad range of key stakeholders some of whom expressed very real concerns in relation to the introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay in February 2012.  The report on this seminar, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. These concerns will be taken into account as the range of complex issues associated with the introduction of such a scheme continues to be considered.</P>
        <P>The issues involved will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of budget 2013 and any decisions which might be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme will be considered in that context.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368, 369 and 386 together. </P>
        <P>The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009. The &euro;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />claimants with a qualified child;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those making a claim for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring directly to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance from Disability Allowance;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</P>
        <P>Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.   While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</P>
        <P>It is understood that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  Officials of the Department  met with Focus Ireland in May, 2012 in relation to their concerns. These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</P>
        <P>More generally, Deputies may wish to note that the Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 and 375 together. </P>
        <P>Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution. The weekly minimum contribution payable for a single person is &euro;30.</P>
        <P>I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these issues following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials met with Focus Ireland in May, 2012 in relation to their concerns. These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</P>

In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaising with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not available on the number of young persons aged 18 to 24 years classed as homeless and in receipt of a reduced social assistance payment or supplementary welfare allowance.  Preliminary figures to end June 2012 show that there were 63,835 persons under 25 years in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance and 5,728 in receipt of basic supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department of Social Protection engage on an ongoing basis with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government on a range of housing issues and the issue of the cost of emergency homeless accommodation can arise as part of these discussions.  My Department is also represented on the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness chaired by the Minister of State with special responsibility for Housing and Planning.</P>

	<P>Total expenditure on the CE programme in 2012 will be some &euro;340 million. The financial review of CE Schemes got underway a couple of months ago and has now been completed. The local Departmental offices have been contacting schemes to advise them of their revised individual material and training allocations.</P>
        <P>Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but will instead be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs of CE Schemes, having regard to the overall level of funding available for CE nationally. To date, significant savings have already been made to the overheads of CE projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.</P>
        <P>There is a mechanism for schemes to appeal their allocation of materials and training for their CE scheme. In addition to the training allocation for schemes, CE participants may also access a number of Springboard, VEC and F&Aacute;S courses free of charge.</P>
        <P>The number of places available on CE has remained constant at 23,300 including supervisors However, the materials and training CE Budget has been increased by &euro;9.5m from the original budget of approximately &euro;11.0m following budget transfer from savings identified elsewhere in the DSP budget.  The new CE materials and training budget is thus &euro;20.5m.</P>
        <P>Details of the CE Financial review are due to be made available in the coming weeks following the outcome of the appeals process.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is a separate Labour Market Activation Schemes policy review nearing completion. This review will inform the Department&rsquo;s strategic approach in relation to labour market activation including the CE programme into the future.</P>
        <P>This review will be of interest and importance to all the stakeholders involved and, accordingly, the Minister for Social Protection will ensure that stakeholders will be able to respond to it findings ahead of a consultation she will hold with stakeholders in the autumn.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 2nd April 2012. It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the case was referred on 1st    May to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.   </P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>The person applied for invalidity pension on 16 August 2011 and for disability allowance on 24 January 2012.</P>
        <P>Following an in-person examination of the person by one of the department&rsquo;s medical assessors, in relation to his claim for invalidity pension, the medical assessor was of the opinion that the person was not eligible for invalidity pension as he did not satisfy the medical criteria.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and refused the claim. The person was notified of this decision on 26 January 2012 and was advised of his right to   request a review of the decision and also of his right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>In relation to his application for disability allowance, the medical evidence supplied with his application was referred to one of the department&rsquo;s medical assessors who was of the opinion, based on the information supplied, that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance. The deciding officer accepted this opinion and the claim was refused on 7 July 2012 and the person was notified in writing of this decision.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Social Welfare Appeals Office that no appeal has been received to date from the person concerned in relation to the refusal either of his invalidity pension or his disability allowance application. If the person wishes to appeal the decision to refuse his disability allowance he should write to the Chief Appeals Officer, Social Welfare Appeals Office, D&rsquo;Olier House, D&rsquo;Olier Street, Dublin 2, within 21 days of notification that his disability allowance application was unsuccessful stating the grounds of his appeal.</P>

	<P>The eligibility criteria for participation in the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) require a person to be in receipt of illness benefit for at least two years prior to commencement of an approved course of study. The person in question is in receipt of illness benefit since 31 December, 2010.  However, if a person fails to satisfy the two year requirement on illness benefit, periods spent on other qualifying social welfare claims can be used to make up the two year qualifying period provided that at least 50% of the two years is spent on illness benefit. </P>
        <P>The person in question will not qualify for BTEA based on their current social welfare record.</P>
        <P>A person in receipt of illness benefit can pursue a course of study while receiving payment without recourse to BTEA if it is medically certified that pursuit of the course will not impede his or her recovery.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has made an application for disability allowance which is currently pending a decision.  A decision on back to education cannot be determined until such time as his entitlement to disability allowance is established. If awarded disability allowance, time spent on illness benefit may counts towards the eligibility period for BTEA.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that the community based welfare service is best placed in  providing  assistance, key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies specifically in response to events such as the recent flooding in Cork.  Designated officers (former Community Welfare Officers) play a vital role in providing a responsive and flexible approach to provide individuals with exceptional and urgent needs payments to offset immediate needs, such as assistance with the purchase of food, clothing, fuel and household goods.  </P>
        <P>In the immediate aftermath of the flooding in Cork, a number of Community Welfare Service clinics extended their services to provide additional emergency support to those affected, made home visits, and provided payments in a responsive and flexible manner. While normal clinics have now resumed, affected persons who are unable to attend their local clinic can request house calls and/or make appointments with Departmental staff to discuss their ongoing needs.</P>
        <P>In addition, officials from the Community Welfare Service are liaising with the Red Cross, the Gardai, businesses and other parties who have offered assistance to those affected. Through this cross-disciplinary approach, appropriate supports are being made available to those in need as swiftly as possible.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the severity of the recent flooding in Cork, the Government has established a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme. The scheme, which is means tested, is intended to provide emergency financial assistance to households who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs in the period immediately following flooding. Persons seeking assistance under this scheme must complete an application form and are required to include information such as evidence of household income, estimates for repairs or replacement, details of insurance policy, invoices/receipts and any other information in support of their claim. This information is required so that each case can be fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner whilst ensuring that the funding is being appropriately targeted to assist those householders most affected.</P>
        <P>People seeking assistance or requiring assistance in completing applications forms for the humanitarian assistance scheme should contact their local Department of Social Protection representative. Further information and applications forms are available on the Department&rsquo;s website (<i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/SupplementaryWelfareAllowance/Pages/HumanitarianAidScheme .aspx</i>).</P>

Payments have been made to 31 individuals totalling approximately &euro;16,000 throughout the affected areas. Most of these payments have been in respect of a household&rsquo;s immediate needs such as clothing, food, bedding and emergency accommodation needs. A breakdown of the payments is provided in the following tabular statement.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Community Welfare Service are liaising with the Red Cross, the Gardai, businesses and other parties who have offered assistance to those affected. Through this cross-disciplinary approach, appropriate supports are being made available to those in need as swiftly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government has announced the extension of the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme, to assist affected householders in Cork.

In tandem with the full implementation of the new system, a comprehensive business process improvement exercise has recently commenced, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.

	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to staff who are employed through employment agencies.  My Department has limited sanction to recruit temporary clerical staff to cover absences of permanent staff on maternity leave, long-term sick leave or other statutory leave and also to provide cover for some staff availing of the shorter working year scheme.  Temporary staff members are also recruited to alleviate work pressure in certain areas.  As the Department&rsquo;s temporary staff are recruited from panels which are established by the Public Appointments Service, my Department does not avail of the services of outside employment agencies.  The State agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board.  In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department.  The Pensions Board uses the services of an employment agency to provide temporary cover in respect of absences of the receptionist and personal assistant.  However, there is no cost to the Exchequer as the operations of the Pensions Board are almost exclusively financed by the annual fees payable to it through occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  The Citizens Information Board uses the services of an employment agency to provide cover in respect of absences of the receptionist.  The costs involved in 2011 were &euro;6,087 and &euro;2,546 to date in 2012.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman does not use the services of an employment agency.</P>

        <Quest> if there are plans to add flexibility to the qualification criteria of social welfare schemes such as the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes and the family income supplement which would take into the account the changes which have occurred in the Irish workplace which have resulted in less predictable, standard working hours that is a teacher employed on a half-week contract but required to be teach over several days and hence ineligible for a payment such as casual jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.  The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees with families on low earnings. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise only be marginally better off than if he or she were in receipt of other social welfare payments.  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of atypical workers.  In response, the Department conducted a &lsquo;Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis&rsquo; which examined the application of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and allowance scheme conditions to workers who are employed on a part-time, casual or systematic short-time basis.  The review made a number of recommendations which are informing current consideration of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and their role in supporting people who avail of a mix of welfare and earned income.</P>

The operations of the Pensions Board are largely financed by the annual fees payable to it by occupational pension schemes and by providers of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.

        <P>Since March 2012, one member of staff in my Department, the Chief Medical Adviser, has been rehired on a temporary contract on a payscale of between &euro;93,197 and &euro;113,503.  His salary is reduced to take account of the rate of his pension payment.  In addition, the acting Deputy Chief Medial Adviser has been retained, on a temporary basis, beyond his normal retirement age on a payscale of between &euro;80,051 and &euro;98,424 with an allowance in respect of performance of the role of Deputy Chief Medical Adviser.  Payment of his pension is suspended pending the termination of his temporary retention.  The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Adviser and to retain the acting Deputy Chief Medical Adviser was taken due to their specific skills and experience, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.</P>

	<P>The Irish language has been promoted on an all-island basis by Foras na Gaeilge, which is an agency of An Foras Teanga, since the establishment of the North-South Implementation Bodies under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  For example, Foras na Gaeilge advertises its schemes, provides educational and recreational resources and engages in corpus planning on an all-island basis.  In regard to Irish language policy and promotion generally, we have excellent ongoing communication and co-operation at ministerial and official levels with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  An Foras Teanga is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council and to the Ministers in the sponsor Departments &mdash; my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.  In that context, the North-South Ministerial Council intends to hold a third language sectoral meeting before the end of the year.  Under the Programme for Government 2011-16, the Government has committed to supporting the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-30 and to delivering the achievable goals proposed therein in this jurisdiction.

	<P>Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr. Conor Skehan, Chair of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Bord na M&oacute;na, and representatives of turf-cutting and environmental groups.  This Forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf-cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog.  In his report, Justice Quirke recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are to be protected. This recommendation was agreed to by the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members&rsquo; Motion, which called for such a national plan to be put in place within the terms of the Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>On 3 April last, a delegation led by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I met the EU Environment Commissioner, Mr. Potocnik, in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.  This wide-ranging plan will examine the practical aspects of conserving, restoring and managing the affected bogs and will allow solutions for turf-cutters, including relocation, to be explored in detail.  In the context of such a plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites where relocation may not be possible.  The plan will be progressed at local level for each site and at national level through the Peatlands Council.  My Department is maintaining ongoing contact with the European Commission in response to the infringement action and will continue to work closely with it in the development of the national plan.  My Department is in contact with several turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, including through relocation to undesignated bogs.  This process will continue as part of the preparation of the National Plan.</P>

        <Quest> the compensation available to farmers, who were required to destock an area (details supplied) in Connemara, for the years 2012 and 2013 who were in REP scheme and have now left it; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, many commonages in the west of Ireland were subjected to serious overgrazing by sheep in the 1980s and into the 1990s, to such an extent that the European Court of Justice made a judgment in 2002 that Ireland was in breach of EU Nature Directives, in particular the Birds Directive, for permitting the deterioration of habitats of the Red Grouse.  The State was obliged to take measures to resolve the effects of the overgrazing.  Thanks to the collaborative effort of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the IFA, local farmers and my Department, recovery from overgrazing has now been delivered in most parts, although some problem areas still remain.  Some additional restrictions were necessary in these areas until there was a significant recovery of vegetation cover and structure.  These restrictions are in place until late 2013, at which point it is hoped the recovery of the vegetation will enable the removal of restrictions.</P>
        <P>Some 25 farmers in the area referred to by the Deputy participate in the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) farm plan scheme, which is managed by my Department.  Compensation for each destocked ewe, below the polluter pays level of 5 ewes/ha over the whole farm, is &euro;39.75.  Off-wintered ewes receive &euro;50 per annum.  In addition, the NPWS covered the cost of preparing the NPWS farm plan.  Due to budgetary constraints, the NPWS farm plan scheme was closed to new applicants in April 2010.  In the areas referred to, the NPWS is also making top-up payments to REPS and AEOS farmers for these additional restrictions.  All farmers who farm within these areas were obliged to enter an approved agri-environmental plan (REPS or NPWS).  Existing REPS farmers were also required to amend their current REPS plans by 1 November 2008 to reflect the new requirements.  For the five years of the scheme, REPS farmers are paid &euro;2,000 by the NPWS for each year in which they have fully met the destocking and off-wintering provisions of their plans until the end of 2013.  In September 2011, I announced an additional compensation measure for destocked farmers in the area referred to by the Deputy whose REPS plans terminated since the closing date for applications to AEOS 2 2011.  Where a farmer&rsquo;s REPS contract had terminated, he/she receives a payment from my Department that equates to a similar amount to what he/she might expect to receive under AEOS.  These payments for out of contract REPS farmers ran until 15 May 2012.</P>

	<P>The Irish Film Board is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.  I have no responsibility for its day-to-day operational matters, including policies and the allocation of resources to different support programmes and schemes.  I have been informed by the board that funding of &euro;2,074,000 was provided in the period between September 2008 to December 2011 for short films and that in the same period &euro;44,000 was recouped.  It may be noted that short film production is one of the key components in the development of film talent such as writers, directors, producers, cast and crew.  Short film production also helps to create employment in the creative and technical areas of the industry.  Irish short films showcase Irish talent and Irish culture to millions worldwide.  They are screened at many international festivals and are viewed millions of times on YouTube.  Irish short films have had eight Oscar nominations in the last ten years.  The potential for significant long-term impacts arising can be seen by the following two examples: Cathal Gaffney (director of the 2002 Oscar-nominated film &ldquo;Give Up Yer Auld Sins&rdquo;) now runs Brown Bag Films, which employs 125 people in Ireland; and Martin McDonagh (director of 2005 Oscar-nominated film &ldquo;Six Shooter&rdquo;) went on to direct the box office and critical hit &ldquo;In Bruges&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 1 of 18 July 2012.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced a series of rationalisation measures in its Public Service Reform Plan on 17 November 2011 and a number of amalgamations, mergers and critical reviews of bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote group are currently being progressed, as required under that plan.  The Heritage Council was one of four bodies, funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote group, that were listed in Appendix IIb of the Reform Plan for critical review. In the context of furthering that review, my Department has met and consulted extensively with the Council and has also considered the views of other stakeholders.  On foot of the recent conclusion by my Department of the critical review of the Heritage Council, I have submitted proposals and recommendations to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which are being examined in the context of submitting a Memorandum to the Government on the matter at the appropriate time. In this context, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that I am not in a position to provide specific details regarding the outcome of the critical review at this time, pending consideration by the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has put in place a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation.  The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme now comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.  Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared.  The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.  An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  To date, 2,275 applications have been received by my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.  Details of the applications are set out in the tables that follow this reply. </P>
        <P>Payments have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the scheme in the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme application form.  My Department has been checking and will be continuing to check that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met.  To date, no applicant has been informed that he or she does not fulfil the qualifying criteria.  Two applicants have been rejected because the areas on which they have been cutting turf are not within a raised bog special area of conservation.  My Department has also begun to make deliveries of 15 tonnes of turf to applicants under the scheme.  To date, some 36 applicants have been approved for these deliveries.  The total amount of money spent to date under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is approximately &euro;1.3 million.  Of this, some &euro;51,000 was paid during 2011 and the balance has been paid in 2012.  The estimated cost of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for 2012 is &euro;5 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The total amount of money spent by my Department to date in compensation payments under the turf cutting compensation scheme is approximately &euro;1.3 million.  The overall cost of the administration required to deliver the scheme is being met from within the staff resources allocated to my Department and is provided for within the administration expenditure of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Additional costs arising to date in respect of overtime associated with the delivery of the compensation payments is &euro;16,070.  There are no readily identifiable additional staffing costs associated with monitoring and enforcement of the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation.  This work is carried out by the existing staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department as part of their normal duties.  With regard to aerial surveillance of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation, my Department has made payments amounting to &euro;24,140 to a private contractor so far this year and invoices for a further &euro;2,157 are being processed for payment.  The provision by the Air Corps of its services for monitoring purposes does not entail a cost to my Department.</P>

        <Quest> the number of alternative bogs which have been sourced for turf cutters forced to relocate; the location of each bog; the number of turf cutters who can be accommodated; if works have to be performed on the bogs to facilitate turf cutting; when it is envisaged to carry these works out in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog Special Areas of Conservation in County Galway. These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly in June last. Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog Special Area of Conservation in County Kildare in a similar manner.</P>
        <P>26 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated at the relocation site in Killeranny. It is envisaged that more will be accommodated at the site for the 2013 cutting season.</P>
        <P>60 applicants for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme from Carrownagappul Bog Special Area of Conservation, 18 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog Special Area of Conservation, and 28 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog Special Area of Conservation have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</P>
        <P>Works have to be carried out on the relocation sites for the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog Special Areas of Conservation and for the group from Ballynafagh Bog Special Area of Conservation. My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters will be able to relocate to the sites for the 2013 cutting season.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing with regard to investigating and assessing potential relocation sites for turf cutters affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation.</P>
        <P>I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the latest figures indicate that of 2,275 applications received in my Department for compensation under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme, some 730 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the National Cultural Institutions operate under the aegis of my Department.  The National Concert Hall, National Library, National Archives, Chester Beatty Library and the National Museum of Ireland are operating their normal opening hours.  </P>
        <P>During the extensive refurbishment works at the main building in IMMA&rsquo;s permanent home at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham in 2012, IMMA is presenting exhibitions at two separate locations.  Exhibitions are continuing throughout 2012 at the New Galleries at IMMA in Kilmainham and since 31 May of this year at IMMA at NCH in Earlsfort Terrace.  In addition, to the exhibitions in Kilmainham, there are also four Family Art Trails in the extensive grounds and Formal Garden.  Normal opening hours continue to operate.      In relation to the National Gallery of Ireland, normal opening hours continue to apply.  However, during the building refurbishment works, approximately 75% of the Gallery space has had to be closed to the public.  In order to compensate for this closure, the Gallery has opened an exhibition highlighting its most popular and best known paintings entitled <i>Masterpieces of the Collection</i>   in the remaining galleries.</P>

        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Kilconny Bog in Counties Cavan/Meath, 1 Payment</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Moneybeg and Clareisland Bogs in Counties Meath/Westmeath, 42 Payments</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Mount Hevey Bog in counties Meath/Westmeath, 11 Payments</P>
        <P FLI="0">In each case the payment has been made to an individual and not a group, scheme or project. The Site Protection Unit also operates the Voluntary Bog Purchase scheme. This is a scheme established to allow the Department to purchase designated bog plots from individuals.  It is possible that sites may have been purchased in County Meath during 2011 and 2012 but it has not yet been possible to confirm this   in the timeframe provided for answering the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider providing funding towards the restoration of St. Mels Cathedral, County Longford, to assist the once off substantial conservation repairs due to a fire; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I can advise the Deputy that officials from my Department actively engaged both with Longford County Council and the St Mel&rsquo;s Cathedral authorities in the aftermath of the fire in December 2009 to offer advice on the conservation of this nationally important protected structure.</P>
        <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s capital programme, &euro;500,000 has been allocated in 2012 specifically for protected structures at risk.  Applications for this funding are made by local authorities to my Department.  However, the deadline for applications in 2012 has now passed and no application was received by my Department in respect of the Cathedral for funding under the <i>Structures at Risk Fund</i>  .</P>
        <P>I note that St. Mel&rsquo;s Cathedral was awarded funding of &euro;100,000 in 2011 by the Heritage Council for a project addressing conservation works to the main entrance door lintel and statues over the portico of the Cathedral under the Council&rsquo;s <i>Significant Places of Worship Grant Scheme</i>.</P>
        <P>The scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State&rsquo;s built heritage is constrained by the current significant reduction in the public finances. However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built heritage, in so far as resources allow.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider the problem that currently faces land owners of heritage sites here with regards to them acquiring public liability insurance; if he will make provisions available for them to acquire public liability insurance at the expense of the State, as sites such as the Hill of Uisneach, County Westmeath, are generating tourism and revenue in the midlands and sites like these should be encouraged and enhanced. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department was established on 2 June 2011.    The salary levels of the two special advisors currently appointed to my office correspond to the first point of the Principal Officer Standard Scale, although, in the case of one advisor, that salary is abated as the person is in receipt of a public service pension.  </P>
        <P>No special advisors have been appointed in the case of the Minister of State at my Department.</P>
        <P>For the sake of completeness, I would also advise that Mr Se&aacute;n Mac C&aacute;rthaigh acted as special adviser to me from 10 March 2011 to 2 March 2012. During that period, he continued to be employed by the Arts Council and his salary, which was at an annual rate corresponding to the 6th point of the Assistant Principal Higher scale, was recouped to the Council by my Department.</P>

	<P>All island energy cooperation is governed by the joint All-island Energy Market Development Framework, 2004, which recognised that both Governments have a shared interest in more competitive energy markets, reduced energy costs and improved reliability of supply.  That framework reinforced the benefits of ensuring that policy developments in both jurisdictions are progressed to mutual interest by delivering improved economic and energy supply benefits for both parts of the island.  The potential for cooperation was demonstrably realised in recent years by the establishment of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) and is reflected in the current work to develop the Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG).</P>
        <P>The Single Electricity Market (SEM), established in 2007, represents one of the first markets of its kind in Europe, creating a single market for the trading of wholesale electricity on the island of Ireland and joining two hitherto separate electricity markets in two EU Member States.  All electricity produced on the island is now sold into one large pool, while supply companies buy their power out of this pool.  The market is specifically designed to ensure that the cheapest possible price for electricity is determined in the wholesale market at all times.  Another key objective of the SEM is to attract new and efficient generators to the island of Ireland.  Because prices have been set transparently, the SEM has created a sound basis for new entry and investment.</P>
        <P>The SEM Committee is the statutory decision-making body which governs the Single Electricity market, including regulators from Ireland (the Commission for Energy Regulation) Northern Ireland (the Utility Regulator) as well as independent member.  In its latest Annual Report, the SEM Committee states that the market has worked well over the last three years and continues to deliver benefits to consumers through the use of efficient generation plant to meet demand across the whole island.  It states further that the SEM model of setting prices in a transparent and cost reflective manner not only assists in the promotion of competition and attract new investment, but has also resulted in improvements in the availability of generation plants.</P>
        <P>The SEM pool system, and the surety that new entrant suppliers that they can purchase electricity from the pool when they need it, has been an important factor in encouraging entry into supply markets.  This has improved customer choice and delivered competition which contributes to downward pressure on prices.</P>
        <P>The ESRI in its review of Irish energy policy last year concluded that one of the key successes of Irish energy policy in recent years was the implementation of the Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland.  It concluded that the SEM had ensured a secure supply of electricity and provided sufficient certainty for investors to ensure adequate investment.</P>
        <P>Building on the success of the SEM, the two regulators and the 2 Departments, North and South, are working together to develop Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) on the island, whereby all players in the gas market can buy, sell, transport and contribute to the development and planning of the natural gas market North and South on an all-island basis. The future evolution of SEM and the establishment of CAG will be profoundly shaped by the emerging rules and arrangements for the regional EU energy markets as part of the EU ambition for completion of the Internal Energy Market.</P>

	<P>I and Government colleagues have consistently been supportive of the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a LNG terminal near Ballylongford, County Kerry.  Such a facility, together with the bringing onshore of Corrib Gas would provide important security of gas supply for Ireland in future years.  I have met the promoters of the project on a number of occasions and both my Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) are in regular contact with Shannon LNG.</P>
        <P>Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily a matter for the CER under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.</P>
        <P>The CER, as the independent energy regulator is statutorily charged with a duty to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  The CER has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.</P>
        <P>The CER has engaged in an extensive consultation process on the future regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and has had considerable interaction with Shannon LNG and Shell Ireland as well as with all key stakeholders. The CER&rsquo;s Decision published on the 29th   June concludes that without reform of the tariff system, the reduced flows of gas through the interconnectors due to new sources of gas coming on stream could lead to significant increases in the per unit interconnector tariff.  In turn, this would increase prices for gas consumers in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Decision commits the CER to the setting of tariffs at each entry point.  It proposes that tariffs would be set separately on the basis of forward looking Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) considerations.  The CER expects the new tariff regime to come into effect in October 2014 following further consultation with stakeholders and a decision by CER on the methodology for setting the LRMC at each entry point.  In that context I welcome CER&rsquo;s decision to establish Network Tariffs Liaison Group as part of the process.</P>
        <P>The CER&rsquo;s decision has brought the regulatory certainty needed by stakeholders in the Irish gas market including those with investment decisions to make in the coming years, as well as gas consumers.</P>

        <Quest> if financial assistance will be provided to old age pensioners to allow them to switch over to digital television on the 24 October 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>First of all, I would like to point out that TV viewers who use the analogue TV network will need to make the change to digital in advance of 24 October and not on 24 October.  TV viewers who currently use pay TV are unaffected.  On 24 October our free to air national analogue TV network which has operated since 1962 will be switched off for good.  The replacement digital free to air TV network, SAORVIEW, has been nationally available since May 2011. Alternatively, TV viewers can choose to upgrade to a pay TV service such as cable or satellite.</P>
        <P>I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings for those households that are reliant on the existing &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; analogue TV network.  In this regard I have chosen to operate both a national information and awareness campaign plus an outreach programme, to provide the assistance and support necessary for everyone to make the switch.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, we have not and do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the SAORVIEW standard on the market, as well as a range of suitable digital televisions.  In addition, experience from other European countries also shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.</P>
        <P>In this regard, therefore, to overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  The campaign commenced on 14 October 2011.  There are a number of strands to the campaign, including a national telephone helpline and a national advertising and public relations campaign.  An information booklet has also been delivered to every household in the country.  The campaign will run up to the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with this, my Department has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  On 10 January 2012, I signed an agreement with a national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).</P>
        <P>The community umbrella group, The Wheel, in conjunction with voluntary and community organisations throughout the country, began to roll out a countrywide Outreach Programme in April/May 2012.  The campaign is being run through 26 County and Local Champions who coordinate activities at a local level with the objective of providing additional assistance and advice at a community level to those who may find the move to digital TV difficult.  The aim of the Outreach Programme is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue service switches off on 24 October 2012. A press release issued on the Outreach Programme and is available on the dedicated digital switchover website <i>www.goingdidital.ie</i>, as is the list of Local Champions referred to above. As there is less than 100 days to go before the 24 October deadline, I would urge all Deputies to engage with the Outreach Programme at their local level in order to urge constituents to move to digital now and not to wait until the last minute.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 441 and 443 together. </P>
        <P>Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the management and Board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.</P>
        <P>As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</P>
        <P>I recently met with the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU), who presented me with a copy of the Grant Thornton report, The future of the Post Office Network in Ireland, which focuses on growing the business to make the network more sustainable.  I have read and considered this report and found it both positive and ambitious.</P>
        <P>In the context of the public sector transformation agenda I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.  I do not, however, consider it necessary to establish an Inter-Departmental Group in relation to this or the recommendations of the report from the IPU.</P>
        <P>Overall, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal terms are tax based and the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of an individual oil or gas field.  Profits from petroleum production arising from exploration licences granted prior to 2007 are taxed at a rate of 25%.  The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field will be through the 25% tax on profits.  The level of profits from the Corrib gas field will depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</P>
        <P>Completion of the Corrib gas field development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.  It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, which began last year, will take in the region of three years.  First gas cannot therefore reasonably be anticipated before 2014.</P>
        <P>The Corrib gas field will also strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply and at peak production will provide approximately 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas needs.  The Deputy might also like to note that during its development phase the Corrib Project has contributed significantly to creating employment in the Erris region.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460, 462 and 468 together.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of ensuring that 16% of all energy consumption is to be from renewable sources by 2020.  This target has to be achieved across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  This target, like all targets assigned to other Member States, is challenging and the Government&rsquo;s priority is to meet these 2020 targets in the most cost effective and economically sustainable manner possible.  To achieve this overall 16% target, Ireland has set out in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan that it intends to achieve 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector, which together make up the requisite 16%.  According to the provisional figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), at the end of 2011, 6.5% of all energy consumed in Ireland was from renewable sources, up from 3.1% in 2005.</P>
        <P>In terms of 2011, 17.6% of electricity consumed is provisionally estimated to be from renewable sources, with 40% required by 2020; 3.6% of transport energy was from renewables, with 10% required by 2020; and 5% of our heat energy was from renewables with 12% required by 2020.  In terms of the trajectory for the electricity sector, our consumption of renewables was at 9.4% in 2007, 11.1% in 2008, 13.7% in 2009, 14.8% in 2010 and an estimated 17.6% in 2011. Further information can be found in SEAI&rsquo;s Renewable Energy in Ireland 2011 report.  17.6% of gross final consumption represents over 5,000 GWh of electricity in the Irish market in 2011.  The latest analysis from the SEAI shows that these alternative energy sources replaced over 12,000 GWh of electricity which otherwise would have been generated by conventional fuel.  This resulted in 21% less overall natural gas imports in 2011 (or 28% less gas for electricity generation) and 0.3% less oil imports than would have been required if renewable energy sources were not deployed.  This would equate to approximately &euro;300 million each year in avoided imports of fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>EirGrid&rsquo;s latest data indicates that at the end of 2011, Ireland had about 1900MW of renewable generation on the grid.  The latest modelling undertaken by SEAI indicates that, provided we achieve our energy efficiency targets, capacity of around 4000MW of renewable generation will be required on the system to deliver the 40% renewable electricity target by 2020.  Through its DS3 programme, EirGrid is working on the necessary operational changes required to the grid to ensure that system security and stability are maintained, while catering for the significantly increased amount of intermittent renewable generation to be incorporated into the electricity system by 2020.  In addition to delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s target for the domestic market the possibility of renewable trade under the framework of the co-operation mechanisms provided for in the Renewable Energy Directive is being pursued bilaterally with the UK.  This aims to develop the potential of exports of the output of certain wind electricity projects to the UK.  SEAI has estimated that the increase in electricity generation from renewable sources has displaced fossil fuel imports resulted in primary energy avoided by 6,613 Gigawatt hours in 2006 to 12,431 Gigawatt hours in 2011. SEAI has estimated that this has saved &euro;968 million in avoided imports over the past five years.</P>

	<P>In 2005 and 2006, the Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) schemes, valued at over &euro;200m in excise foregone, were introduced as an interim measure to incentivise the use of biofuels in Ireland.  Prior to introduction of the schemes, market penetration of biofuels in Ireland was almost non existent.  These schemes ended in 2010, with the introduction of the national Biofuel Obligation Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 to underpin delivery of the mandatory EU target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  As a result in 2011, 145 million litres of biofuel was placed on the market.  This obligation will increase over time and by 2020 it will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.  This will ultimately create a market size of approaching 500 million litres of biofuel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that I have received submissions from the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland with regard to their recent proposals which include suggestion to the effect that licence fee funds be dispersed to independent broadcasters in recognition of their public sector output and that RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s commercial operations be restricted.</P>
        <P>It should be clear that these stations were founded as commercial operations with creating a profit for their owners central to their objectives.  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear commercial terms.  In many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide public funds &mdash; they are and remain commercial companies.  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a potentially strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.  As the economy recovers, it is to be expected that this commercial pressure will ease as advertising revenues recover apace.  Indeed, the recent review of the radio sector carried out by the BAI reveals that the overall sustainability of services is not in question, despite the challenging commercial situation that some stations find themselves in.</P>
        <P>In practical terms, EU State Aid rules provide a serious and unavoidable obstacle to the IBI proposal.  The Principle of Additionality means that State funding can only be provided to companies where, in the absence of such funding, the service would not be delivered.  The fact that the commercial broadcasters already provide a range of public service content voluntarily would clearly rule out the provision of any state funds on this basis.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is presently engaged in the first &lsquo;5 year review&rsquo; under Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  This review, which builds on the single year reviews completed thus far, and will examine issues in relation to Section 108 of the Act and the commercial funding of these corporations as well as the impact of further &lsquo;top slicing&rsquo; of the available licence fee fund.  As such, I expect that it will fully engage with questions around RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s presence in the advertising market, and the nature of their commercial remit.  I will, of course, consider any suggestions or recommendations that may emanate from this around legislative change.  Equally, I remain of the view that the existing BAI Levy system is the most appropriate means by which that organisation should be funded, and I see no compelling reason to change that position in the current circumstances.</P>

	<P>With regard to the post office network, operational matters and the sustainability of the post office network are a matter for the management and board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.  As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.  An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.  This strategy is bearing fruit with the enhanced arrangement with AIB and I fully support the Company&rsquo;s strategy in this regard and its recent heads of agreement with Aviva.</P>
        <P>I recently met with the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union who presented me with a copy of the Grant Thornton report, The Future of the Post Office Network in Ireland, which focuses on growing the business to make the network more sustainable.  I have read and considered this report and found it both positive and ambitious.  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, I will continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Government Departments and Agencies and have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions.</P>
        <P>In relation to postal services, the Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 has put in place a robust and appropriate regulatory framework for the postal services market.  While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Act charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector and particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.  ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.  Under the 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.  The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act of 2011 also makes provision for a compensation mechanism, to be met by the postal industry, if it is found that the universal service obligation is an unfair burden on the designated universal service provider.</P>

	<P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access and associated fast speeds to every home and business in the State.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT) report, which I launched on 2 May last, will have an important role to play in this regard.  The Taskforce, which I chaired, comprised the CEOs of ten broadband services providers.  The industry participants included the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.</P>
        <P>In launching the report, I also commenced a public consultation to allow all other interested parties to comment on the document and to offer any additional or alternative proposals.  The public consultation closed in early June and more than 50 responses were received for consideration.  Building on the work of the Taskforce and the responses received, it is my intention to bring proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed services on a national basis which will take due account of the NGBT report and the additional responses received.</P>

	<P>The management of all aspects of any organisations IT systems is a matter primarily for the relevant organisation itself.

        <P>With respect to the recent experiences in the banking sector I believe the problem originated with an implementation of a software upgrade and that it was not related to any cyber incident.  I understand that the banking sector, in 2006, established a forum to discuss and share information on cyber threats.  This forum reflects the priority being given to cyber protection.  I also understand that the banking industry have organised a number of conferences and structured exercises where cyber threats and incidents are discussed and response plans are tested.</P>
        <P>The issue of cyber security is also being addressed by the European Commission.  The Commission is currently bring forward proposals for an EU strategy on cyber security and a new EU Regulation aimed at harmonising cyber capabilities across all Member States.

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).  The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties in the State.  As of 17 July 2012, the number of properties registered for the non-principal private residence charges in 2012 was 273,163.  The full year figure for 2011 was 330,652.  The majority of residential properties in the State are owner-occupied and as such would not be liable for the NPPR.  I am satisfied with the response to date to the legislation, which places the onus on the owner of a property to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.  However, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority and ultimately for the courts.</P>

	<P>Interest rates charged to local authority borrowers are determined by the Board of the Housing Finance Agency (HFA). In determining these rates, the Board of the Agency gives careful consideration to the fluctuating relationship between the rates at which it can borrow and its lending rates. The HFA is required to operate on a break-even basis and continues to provide extremely good value to local authority customers. I am acutely conscious of the fact that a considerable number of local authority borrowers are already facing difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments. However, local authority borrowers have benefited from very significant easing of mortgage costs in recent years. The effective rate for local authority borrowers since 9 November 2011 has been 3%. This has resulted in a differential of almost 1.5% between the rate charged to local authority borrowers and the average variable rate available from private lending institutions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 and 484 together.</P>
        <P>I believe there is a need for a more coherent and joined-up approach to service provision at local level, which supports the priorities of both national and local government.  To this end, I established an expert Steering Group to provide me with proposals to develop greater alignment between local government and local development. The aim in this regard is to improve the delivery of services for citizens at local level and achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
        <P>In my own consideration of these issues and, I believe, in that of the Steering Group, there is a strong awareness of the valuable work of local development entities in their delivery of services for communities.  I believe it is important that, in the context of potential reforms, we retain and develop community engagement and input to local and community development programmes and processes.  I am currently finalising my consideration of the Steering Group&rsquo;s final report with a view to determining the arrangements that will deliver the maximum benefit for local communities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483, 485 and 523 together.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve the best outcomes for our communities and citizens, it is important that we examine the delivery arrangements and structures in place for exchequer and EU-funded programmes.  This includes programmes such as the Local and Community Development Programme which my Department funds and manages in co-operation with Pobal, and which is implemented by 51 local development companies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>An important part of this consideration was my establishment of an expert Steering Group to consider options for a greater alignment of local government and local development, with a view to improving the delivery of services for citizens at local level and achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness.  I am currently finalising my consideration of the Steering Group&rsquo;s final report.</P>
        <P>The Steering Group&rsquo;s interim report, published in December 2011, highlighted the need for administrative, operational and spatial alignment of local and community development service provision along local authority county/city boundaries, to enable greater ease of access and to deliver more sustainable local services for citizens.  In considering the final alignment proposals, I will have regard to the need for arrangements that will deliver the maximum benefit for communities and citizens.  These arrangements will respect the diversity represented in all communities, including those in the Dublin area, while also respecting and supporting the priorities of key local and community development programmes.</P>
        <P>Local development companies are independent companies and I am not in a position to merge them. Issues around staffing are first and foremost a matter for the companies. My Department, in conjunction with Pobal, contracts the companies for the delivery of the Local and Community Development Programme and in the event of any changes to existing contractual arrangements, my key priority will be the efficient and effective achievement of the programme&rsquo;s objectives and the best outcomes for communities and citizens.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486, 489, 545 and 550 together.</P>
        <P>The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 was signed by the President on 2 February.    Registration facilities (both on-line and by written application) have been available to owners of domestic waste water treatment systems since 26 June on foot of the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Registration) Regulations 2012, a copy of which are available in the Oireachtas library.  Householders served by a domestic waste water treatment system have to register their system by 1 February 2013.  A reduced registration fee of &euro;5 will apply to those registering on or before 28 September 2012.  The fee will then increase to &euro;50.</P>
        <P>A public consultation process on draft performance standards for domestic waste water treatment systems was concluded on 30 March.  In total, 165 submissions were received and these included a submission from An Taisce.  All submissions were thoroughly reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and informed the preparation of the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems Regulations 2012 which I signed on 26 June 2012.  I am satisfied that the Act and the associated regulations satisfactorily address the legislative deficit highlighted by the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009 and my Department continues to liaise closely with the EU Commission on the case.</P>
        <P>Inspections under the new legislation will commence in 2013.  I have stated on many occasions that there is no question of applying modern standards, such as those in the EPA&rsquo;s 2009 Code of Practice, to older domestic waste water treatment systems nor is there any question of additional land being required to facilitate remediation work that might be required.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 515 together.</P>
        <P>In December 2011 NAMA identified over 2,000 properties as being potentially available for social housing.  Since that announcement my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards bringing NAMA units into social use.  Housing authorities have been assessing the suitability of the units identified with regard to location, local demand, the nature and type of the accommodation and sustainable communities&rsquo; principles.  Of the original number, 701 have been deemed unsuitable by housing authorities.  A further 372 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners, as circumstances have changed.</P>
        <P>At present demand has been confirmed for nearly 1,200 units and these are currently being processed.  Discussion and negotiation has commenced in respect of these properties which are at various stages of the appraisal and approval process.  Inspection of properties, which takes place in all cases, is a part of this process.  Of the 1,200 properties for which local authorities have demand, contracts are signed in respect of 58 units, 405 are being processed through the approval stage and 719 are being appraised.  There are no units operational at this stage; however, it is expected that units will be tenanted in the second half of the year.  NAMA continues to work with a view to identifying additional units suitable for inclusion in the programme.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that legislation in countries such as France and the Netherlands provided automatic registration to self-taught architects thorough acquired rights; his views on whether self-taught architects from Ireland are discriminated on in this instance; and his plans to remedy this problem </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of the architectural profession in countries such as France and the Netherlands is a matter for the competent authorities in those countries. In Ireland the arrangements for the registration of the use of the title of architect are set out under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.  A number of routes to registration are provided for in Sections 14, 15, 16 and 22 of the Act having regard to the differing approaches to gaining the requisite knowledge, skills and experience adopted by individual applicants.</P>
        <P>In relation to practically-trained architects, Section 22 includes a provision to address the position of such persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.   This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure.  In addition, Section 14(f) provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination.</P>
        <P>Taken in their totality the various routes to registration provided for under Part 3 of the Act represent a registration process that is open, fair and transparent.  The question of discrimination does not arise.  The factual position is that specific provisions have been put in place to ensure that practically trained architects can be included on the register for the purposes of the Act.  To date 31 practically trained persons have been deemed eligible for inclusion on the register of architects.  Of these, 6 underwent the technical assessment process and 25 underwent the register admission examination.  I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are currently open to them with a view to joining the small but growing numbers of practically trained architects already on the register.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Due to the current fiscal situation, my Department has focused on reducing outstanding funding commitments under the Leverage Schemes by closing the schemes to all new funding applications and paying down existing commitments only.  My Department is providing funding of &euro;4.15m this year to support the RAPID Programme. This includes funding towards the salary costs of RAPID Coordinators, who are Local Authority staff. In addition, I have allocated &euro;440,000 (&euro;88,000 per town) this year in Dormant Accounts funding for five provincial towns, which were assigned RAPID status in 2009; these are Ballina, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Mullingar and Rathkeale. In December 2010, Pobal, in consultation with the RAPID Area Implementation Teams (AITs), recommended a number of capital projects in these towns. Pobal recently contacted the relevant AITs, who, using their local knowledge and expertise, have chosen the most important and effective projects which can be delivered this year from the lists they have in place. The prioritised list has been approved by Government and the beneficiaries will be advised shortly.

	<P>In accordance with the Public Service Management Act 1997, my Department has published a Statement of Strategy 2011-2014, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website &mdash; <i>www.environ.ie</i>. A full list of Programme for Government commitments for which my Department has lead responsibility is included as an Appendix to the Statement of Strategy. The Strategy is fully aligned with the Government for National Recovery Programme 2011-2016 and the commitments contained in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support<i>. </i>By its nature, the Statement is a high level document setting out how the Department will, over the next three years, implement the Government&rsquo;s high level policy objectives and Programme for Government commitments, and progress its longer-term policy goals, as set out in the relevant National Strategies. High level objectives, key strategies, outputs and context and impact indicators by which performance will be measured have been set out in the Statement of Strategy. The Revised Estimates for Public Services, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2012 (available on <i>www.per.gov.ie</i>) also detail the key output targets for my Department.</P>
        <P>The Department recently reported on progress in implementing its Strategy, including Programme for Government commitments, in its 2011 Annual Report (also available on <i>www.environ.ie</i>). In addition, an integrated annual progress report, under the Public Sector (Croke Park) Agreement 2010-2014 for my Department and its agencies was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in May 2012 and it reports progress on certain Programme for Government commitments.  My Department also contributes to central reporting on specific Programme for Government commitments.  For example, my Department reported progress on implementing Programme for Government commitments in the recently published Programme for Government: Annual Report 2012, Year 1: Stability (available on <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>).</P>

	<P>The moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service was introduced in March 2009 in response to the financial crisis. My Department operates a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities, and any exceptions to the moratorium in local authorities require sanction from my Department.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for City and County Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.</P>
        <P>My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services, and economic issues are given precedence.</P>

	<P>I am determined to fulfil my commitment to provide for mandatory certification and the submission of drawings which I have previously highlighted as key reforms necessary to improve the quality of buildings and to further strengthen the regulatory regime.  The public consultation process in relation to the proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations concluded on 24 May 2012 and a total of 503 submissions were received by my Department.  The Department is currently reviewing all submissions received with a view to producing a final set of regulations for signature into law. In line with standard arrangements my Department continues to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the new regulatory regime will be clearly understood by all concerned and can work well in practice. In particular, as indicated during the public consultation process, a Code of Practice for persons assigned to inspect and certify construction works is currently being prepared in consultation with industry stakeholders and will be available in advance of the implementation of the proposed regulations.</P>
        <P>The work outlined above is receiving priority attention in my Department and I anticipate being in a position to conclude the process in the coming months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 and 502 together.</P>
        <P>Given the move away from large-scale and resource-intensive social housing construction programmes by local authorities and the consequent absence of representative tender prices, there is no evidence-base to support the compilation of accurate costings for the construction of social houses. However, based on the most recent proposals received from 32 local authorities for the construction of some 185 social houses, by way of small infill developments, the average cost of providing a social housing unit is around &euro;162,000. These figures are, for the most part, based on cost estimates for a range of house types and actual cost may only be determined once tenders have been received.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 519 and 521 together.</P>
        <P>The Water Framework Directive aims to establish a common framework for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and groundwater.  The Directive requires surface waters to be classified into one of five classes &mdash; high, good, moderate, poor or bad according to their ecological status which is defined as an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not support aquatic ecosystems adequately.  The EPA&rsquo;s recently published report Ireland&rsquo;s Environment 2012 &mdash; An Assessment, shows that approximately 71% of river channel is at high or good status while 46.6% of lakes monitored are at high or good status.</P>
        <P>These figures compare favourably with those in other EU countries but challenges remain if the ambitious aim of the Directive is to be achieved.  The main pressures on water quality in Ireland stem from municipal wastewater treatment plants and diffuse sources, particularly agricultural activities and a programme of measures is in place to address these pressures.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made in recent years by water services authorities in the provision and management of wastewater services in their areas. This progress has been possible through high levels of investment coupled with new legislation on the licensing of wastewater treatment plants.</P>
        <P>Over &euro;5.5 billion in Exchequer resources has been invested between 2000 and 2011 in water services infrastructure. In the same period, 341 wastewater treatment schemes and contracts were completed. This has led to an increase in treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of population of almost 3.9 million. Ireland is currently about 93% compliant with the 2005 deadline of the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring secondary treatment for discharges from agglomerations above certain specified size thresholds, compared with 25% in 2000.</P>
        <P>When the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013 was published in 2010, it detailed 59 wastewater contracts in progress with a value of &euro;500 million and 161 contracts to be progressed to construction over the period of the Programme, with a value of just over &euro;1 billion.  A further 94 wastewater schemes were listed for work to be undertaken on the earlier planning stages of those schemes.  Following a review of this Programme in 2011, a further 8 wastewater contracts to be progressed were added, together with 3 additional schemes to proceed through planning.  Significant progress is being made in advancing these schemes and contracts.</P>
        <P>The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007-2010 provide for an authorisation system for all wastewater discharges to waters from treatment plants or collection systems owned or controlled by local authorities. The purpose of the authorisation system is to prevent and reduce pollution of waters by wastewater discharges. As part of the authorisation process, the EPA can place conditions on the operation of individual plants and systems and it can set emission limit values for the discharges.</P>
        <P>Pollution from agricultural sources has been targeted through significant investment by farmers and the State under the Farm Waste Management Scheme and by the implementation of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010.  Pollution from domestic waste water systems is being addressed by the requirements of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and I anticipate that the implementation of the new registration and inspection system will contribute to further improvements in water quality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland, generally, has an abundant natural water resource with a water exploitation index, i.e. the percentage of long-term renewable resources abstracted, well below 10% according to the European Environment Agency. However, a number of individual surface water and groundwater bodies are known to have been impacted by over-abstraction.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Regulations 1978 require local authorities to maintain a register of water abstractions greater than 25 cubic metres per day but there is no comprehensive national register of water abstractions.  Compliance with the 1978 regulations has been variable and as a result, information on the exact number of abstraction points and their location as well as the volume of abstractions is not complete.</P>
        <P>For this reason and because Article 11(3)(e) of the Water Framework Directive obliges Member States to implement controls over abstractions, including a register of abstractions and a system of prior authorisation, I intend, subject to Government approval,  to bring forward legislation next year to address the situation.  As a first step, my Department will commence a public consultation on the matter in the autumn.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the national homelessness strategy and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness. The draft of the review report is being considered by my Department and was presented recently to the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness, which includes a representative from the Department of Social Protection, and the Homeless Consultative Committee for consultation. The review will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies. On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</P>

        <P>The reform programme will also reflect other work under way in relation to various aspects of local government, including local authority mergers, efficiency implementation, local government funding and alignment of local and community development with local government. The decisions to merge local authorities in Limerick and Tipperary will give rise to a review of local electoral areas in these counties and subject to the final shape of the decisions by Government, the wider policy proposals being brought forward will also give rise to an examination of local electoral boundaries.</P>

In this regard, public servants make up over half of the combined membership of the Boards of agencies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis.</P>

In the water and wastewater sector, many PPP projects are procured on a design, build, operate and maintain (DBOM) basis.  In these cases, the Exchequer provides up-front capital funding so there are no capital or financing costs to be paid back over the life of the project.  Annual operating costs (paid by the relevant local authorities) are based on the volume of water/wastewater arriving for treatment.</P>

	<P>The Water Framework Directive requires Member States to coordinate their efforts in relation to international river basin districts with the aim of producing a single international management plan.  Work on development of the international river basin management plans for the North-Western and Neagh-Bann districts was marked by close coordination between the authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland including agreeing on programmes of measures to address water quality issues on both side of the border.  The basis for this coordination of effort is the 1999 British-Irish Agreement that established the North South Ministerial Council which is specifically mandated to promote cooperation in the area of water quality management.  The primary means of coordination is through the North-South Working Group on Water Quality which is supported by a number of technical working groups with representatives from the implementing authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland. </P>
        <P>Insofar as the provision of water services on a cross-border basis is concerned, it is a matter in the first instance for the water services authorities in the border region to co-operate with each other in the provision of water services where this is feasible and cost effective.  Because of the distance between such services north and south of the border there is very limited scope for such co-operation.</P>

	<P>My Department maintains good ongoing contact with its counterparts in Northern Ireland in relation to housing matters generally, including homelessness.  While I have no plans to introduce an all-Ireland homelessness strategy the scope for all-Ireland approaches on particular issues and exchange of information and good practice will be borne in mind in the context of these contacts and in the review of the national homeless strategy generally.  The strategic objectives of the recently published Homeless Strategy for Northern Ireland 2012-2017<i> </i>align with many of the policy objectives outlined in The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013<i>.</i></P>
        <P>They both recognise the importance of adopting a housing led approach, reducing the amount of time spent in homeless services, eliminating the need to sleep rough and the need to place prevention at the forefront of service delivery.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the National Homeless Strategy, The Way Home  2008-2013 and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness and work on the review is almost complete. The review will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for marine matters is spread across a number of Departments and agencies and, in recognition of the need for better coordination on marine matters, a Marine Coordination Group comprising senior civil servants from the relevant Departments and chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been overseeing the development of an integrated marine plan for Ireland which is expected to be published shortly.  The plan will provide a new momentum for growth in the marine area and will identify a range of actions to be implemented to deliver the Plan including an appropriate Maritime Spatial Planning Framework for Ireland. </P>
        <P>In addition, and in keeping with commitments in the Programme for Government, work on the general scheme of a Bill to modernise the foreshore consent system and integrate it within the wider planning system is being progressed by my Department.  The aim is to complete this work in the second half of the year and to arrange, subject to Government approval, for the drafting of the Bill as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>My Department has lead responsibility for implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), a major piece of EU legislation that requires Member States to achieve good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 at the latest. Good environmental status in the marine environment means that the seas are clean, healthy and productive and that human use of the marine environment is maintained at a sustainable level.   The preliminary work on Ireland&rsquo;s initial assessment under the MSFD is underway.  This work will provide an accurate picture of the environmental status of our marine waters so that appropriate targets can be set in pursuit of good environmental status.  As part of the initial assessment, an atlas of the Irish marine environment will be developed which will include the collation of all relevant marine environmental datasets (e.g. on marine habitats, seabed geology, contaminant mapping, etc.)  into a central geographical data and information system.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the &euro;100 household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.   I understand from data provided by the LGMA that as of 13 July 2012, a total of 986,676 declarations had been received in respect of the household charge. 17,993 of these households have claimed a waiver from the charge.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that Section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that the Property Services Regulatory Authority shall prepare and maintain a register of residential property sales prices in the State. I am advised by the Authority that it expects to publish the register by the end of September 2012.  It is anticipated that the residential property sales prices register will comprise a database searchable by a number of criteria including address of property, value of property, by county, city or town.  The information which will be contained in the database will be the full address of the property, its sale price and date of sale.  The register will, at the outset, cover all sales between 1 January 2010 to date of publication.  It is anticipated that the information will be updated regularly and will be current within 30 days of the actual date of sale of the property.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the details requested by him are not recorded by my Department in a manner as would enable me to readily provide him with such information.  It is not possible to disaggregate the details of every person deported for the last 10 years to ascertain, in consultation with the Health Service Executive (HSE), whether such persons had ever been in the care of the HSE. The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction and compilation of such information would require my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service  (INIS) to individually examine thousands of files and consult with the HSE and I could not justify the deflection of such officials from their day to day work to assemble this information.</P>

        <Quest> the resources that will be made available to assist the family court system in view of the increase in referrals and legal cases that will be caused by mandatory reporting of child protection concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Several pieces of legislation have implications in terms of mandatory reporting of child protection concerns. The Criminal Justice (Withholding of information on offences against children and vulnerable adults) Act 2012 which is due to be commenced shortly will make it an offence for a person to fail to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they know or believe that a serious offence has been committed against a child or vulnerable person.</P>
        <P>Separately, my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has announced that she is preparing legislation to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory basis. Under this proposed legislation organisations and named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse or significant neglect to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that any legal cases arising from the reporting requirements under either piece of legislation would likely impact on the criminal court rather than the family courts. It is not envisaged that the legislation will have any significant impact on the caseload of the family court system. I am conscious, however, that increases in referrals would have implications for other services concerned with child protection.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government, at its meeting on 17 July 2012, approved, in principle, proposals for a number of major reforms to our courts structures which will, in due course, require the holding of a Constitutional referendum. The proposed reforms would, if approved by the People in a referendum, facilitate the establishment of a new separate Family Courts structure.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in October, 2008.</P>
        <P>The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. In that regard a letter issued on the 25th June 2012 giving an update on the status of this case.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.</P>
        <P>As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005-2007, the Commissioner is required to submit, before November of each year, a policing plan for the forthcoming year.  Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in that plan. While the Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been submitted to me, I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network. It would therefore be premature to speculate on specific measures which this might involve.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest> the cost of spending on sports equipment in each prison in both 2010 and 2011; the corresponding figure for balls; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36177/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the financial records of the Irish Prison Service show the following breakdown of expenditure on sports equipment and footballs in each prison during 2010 and 2011. The breakdown for balls in the table below refers to footballs only, it is not possible to include the figure for other balls e.g. snooker balls, tennis balls, pool balls etc.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate there are significant benefits to be gained from involvement in physical education be it in a community setting or in the prison environment. In the prison setting physical education affords prisoners the opportunity to take control of one aspect of their daily life, their physical well-being, with the potential knock-on effect of increasing their motivation and confidence to tackle other identified issues such as substance abuse, taking up education or work / training opportunities.</P>
        <P>It is also recognised that physical education, sport and recreation plays a significant role in the management of prison life by providing positive outlets for energy.</P>

	<P>The granting of sentence remission is a feature of many prison systems worldwide and has been a feature of the Irish criminal justice system since the foundation of the State.  Indeed our Courts are aware of the statutory entitlement to remission when passing sentence.  I am finalising details regarding membership and terms of reference for the establishment of an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy which would incorporate an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female prisoners.  The general issue of remission, including its use in the context of sexual offenders, will fall within the remit of that review and I will await their recommendations before making any decision on this matter.</P>

	<P>While I am of course concerned about the incidents referred to by the Deputy, it is important to note that the most recent recorded crime statistics report an overall reduction in robberies of more than 8% over the preceding 12 months.</P>
        <P>There are very strong laws in place to deal with gang and armed crime and criminals are being brought before the courts on a regular basis by the Garda&iacute; and substantial sentences handed down.  I have made it clear that I will review any proposals for improvement to the laws in this area.  While the existing laws are of great assistance to the Garda&iacute;, I have already asked that the organised crime measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 be examined to see if these provisions can be strengthened.  I also recently moved motions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad to renew these provisions to ensure they remain available to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner on all aspects of crime and public safety and met with him this week to discuss crime issues, including these recent incidents.  Garda investigations are underway into the robberies referred to, arrests have been made and the Garda Commissioner has indicated publicly that he is confident that good progress will be made in these investigations.  I have every confidence in the capacity and determination of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to confront this type of criminality and bring those involved to justice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 578, 589 and 590 together.</P>
        <P>While concerns about crime are fully understandable they should be seen in the context of a fall in most categories of recorded crime, including homicide, public order and assault over the past year.  Robust policing measures are in place to respond to concerns about urban crime. These include the designation of certain areas as hotspots for criminality and additional high visibility patrols being directed by local Garda management.</P>
        <P>Insofar as calls for a Dublin crime task force are concerned, the position is that a high visibility policing initiative has been introduced in the Dublin area by the Garda authorities. Special operations are also in place, such as Operation Stilts, which deals with anti-social behaviour and drug dealing on the boardwalk, the north quays and adjacent areas, and Operation Pier which focuses on reducing incidents of public disorder in the Temple Bar area.</P>
        <P>Calls for a special task force also overlook the work of the Joint Policing Committees, which include the Garda&iacute; and local authorities, and which are designed to bring about a coordinated approach between the various agencies to the problem of crime. As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a review of the operation of the JPCs and all interested parties will have an opportunity to contribute to that process.</P>
        <P>I also am in regular engagement with all relevant stakeholders in addressing crime issues, for example, in my work with the outgoing Lord Mayor of Dublin&rsquo;s commission on anti-social behaviour and in the development with Government colleagues of effective responses to the problems of alcohol and drug abuse at the root of much violent street crime. I have also met recently with members of the Dublin City Business Improvement District to discuss their concerns about anti-social behaviour in the city and have further discussed these concerns with the Commissioner.  There are undoubtedly many challenges faced in addressing urban crime in Ireland, challenges faced in cities throughout the world, but I am not persuaded that the solutions lie in establishing new task forces or other bureaucratic structures.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was originally granted leave to remain in the State for a three year period, to 19 August 2011. The person concerned registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and has since had his leave to remain in the State renewed for a further three year period, to 19 August 2014. This decision was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 30 August 2011. The person concerned was only registered by the GNIB for six months as he did not have a valid passport and this gave him time to obtain a valid passport. This permission has since expired and the person concerned was asked by this Department in a letter dated 4 July 2012 to submit a copy of his current passport, or alternatively submit evidence as to what effort he has made to secure a passport. To date no such correspondence has been received.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby any person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling house. is scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority. Since it was introduced in 1978, over 80,000 applicants have availed of the scheme to acquire the freehold title to their property.  I should note that the value of a ground rent lease to a landlord increases the closer the lease is to expiry and the best advice to give tenants is to buy out their ground rent in good time.  is has been the consistent advice offered by Ministers for Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P>In the case of property other than dwelling houses, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.  Any proposal regarding the abolition of ground rents is, however, subject to the resolution of possible constitutional and practical difficulties.  The constitutional difficulties referred to concern the respective rights of ground rent tenants and landlords while the practical difficulties concern land law generally and in particular the land registration system.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Two of the proposed arrangements in the Personal Insolvency Bill &mdash; Debt Settlement Arrangement and the Personal Insolvency Arrangement &mdash; will require the involvement of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner.  The intention is that the Personal Insolvency Practitioner will act as an intermediary between the debtor and his or her creditors. The Bill sets out in some detail the duties of the Practitioner from initial assessment of the debtor&rsquo;s suitability for a particular arrangement, to negotiation of the arrangement and through to its completion. The role of the Practitioner is critical to the proper functioning of the debt settlement arrangements as it is vital that debtors be properly and independently advised as to the implications of all options available to them prior to arriving at a decision. The average debtor is at a disadvantage <i>vis a vis </i>  credit institutions and other creditors in terms of experience, advice and expertise. Once a debt settlement is agreed and registered, the Personal Insolvency Practitioner effectively becomes the custodian of the arrangement.</P>
        <P>The provisions of this Bill will require careful consideration by all potentially concerned with its provisions. I would stress, however, that individual circumstances vary and that the solutions found within the context of the Debt Settlement Arrangement and Personal Insolvency Arrangement processes will also vary. I must emphasise that the Bill makes it clear that those persons experiencing difficulties in regard to debt must, primarily, engage with their lenders so as to seek to negotiate an appropriate settlement.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in there is close liaison between local Garda management and event organisers in relation to the planning and management of events such as those referred to by the Deputy.  At an operational level, policing plans and event management plans are prepared to determine the appropriate deployment of Garda resources and the optimal deployment of security personnel.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the incidents at the recent concert in the Phoenix Park are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na held an initial meeting with the concert organisers last week and it was agreed that both organisations will carry out a more in depth review regarding all aspects of the event, including the implementation of the plans which had been drawn up.  The fact is that the arrangements which were in place on the night in question did not prevent the type of behaviour which took place.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has undertaken to let me have a full report following that review and I can assure the Deputy that I am determined any lessons will be taken fully into account in future planning and risk management of such events.</P>

	<P>The Garda National Model of Community Policing, which is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan, underlies An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s approach to crime prevention and local engagement.

Policing measures are in place to address difficulties experienced by local residents, including public drinking and other, associated, disorder and anti-social behaviour, and that regular patrols are conducted by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units, local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.</P>

The forum also feeds into the local Joint Policing Committee which meets every quarter.</P>
        <P>I am advised that local Garda management closely monitors patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs in the area to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Garda management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service is being delivered and I am further advised that the situation is being kept under review.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I was very glad to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Cabinet as a whole for such a significant number of appointments.</P>
        <P>The agreement I have reached with my colleague will in fact enable the appointment of 1 Assistant Commissioner, 7 Chief Superintendents and 18 Superintendents, as well as the filling of consequential senior vacancies arising from these appointments.  I will be seeking the approval of the Government for the balance of the appointments as soon as new Garda promotion panels have been established.  The agreement also means that, from now on, the strength of the senior ranks can be maintained at these new levels, so that any further vacancies within those levels will be promptly filled.  This will contribute significantly towards the maintenance of the operational capacity and effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The allocation of all resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in consultation with his senior management.  I have no direct role in this matter.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 984 of 18 April 2012 which was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;On publication of the Heads of the Personal Insolvency Bill on 25 January 2012, both the Minister for Finance and I invited interested parties to submit their comments on the legislative proposals.  In that context I can confirm that my Department has received submissions from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association as well as from a small number of individual credit unions.  In addition, representatives from my Department and the Department of Finance met with credit union representatives last month to brief them on the proposed legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The submissions and other comments on the General Scheme of the Personal Insolvency Bill received from credit union representatives are being taken into consideration in the overall context of the further development of the legislative proposals.&rdquo;  Further to that reply, I should mention that credit union representatives attended a briefing session on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 which was given by officials from my Department and the Department of Finance on 29 June, 2012 on publication of the legislation.</P>

	<P>In my second stage speech on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 July 2012, I gave an indication of the possible number of persons who might avail of the new debt settlement mechanisms.  My statement on the matter was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;.........As to the issue of the number of persons who may seek to avail of the new or reformed insolvency processes, it is difficult to be precise. It will very much depend on individual circumstances and the nature and extent of the debts involved. However, for broad planning purposes, there is a tentative estimate, based on a rough extrapolation from the comparable UK and Northern Ireland situations, of the following applications for the first full year of operation of the new law and systems:</P>
        <P LI="2">(a) 15,000 applications for non-judicial debt resolution &mdash; Debt   Settlement Arrangement and Personal Insolvency Arrangement,</P>
        <P LI="2">(b) 3,000 to 4,000 applications for Debt Relief Notices, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(c) 3,000 plus bankruptcy applications. (There were about 30   bankruptcy adjudications in 2011).</P>
        <P LI="1">Again, I would stress that these estimates are tentative. Not all insolvencies will require to be dealt with under the new statutory debt resolution processes or bankruptcy. I would expect that the certainty brought to the future legal landscape by this Bill will encourage debtors and creditors to bilaterally agree alternative solutions including in respect of mortgage debt under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process operated by mortgage lenders under the supervision of the Central Bank......&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific details of operations and initiatives that are put in place by the Garda authorities to combat the activities of groups such as those he refers to.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na targets all organisations and individuals who engage in criminality and they work very closely with their counterparts in the Police Service of Northern Ireland in this regard.  The level of co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI has never been higher.  The two forces co-operate seamlessly, across the range of policing activities.</P>
        <P>Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable and their respective forces.  Both police chiefs have emphasised the close nature and the high quality of the ongoing co-operation between their forces and it has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.  The two police forces operate a Cross-Border Policing Strategy, which includes cross-Border investigations and operations, intelligence-sharing and security, information and communications technology and emergency planning.</P>

	<P>The number of prisoners in custody as of Tuesday, 17th July was 4,521.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  It should be noted that this is the busiest time of the year for committals prior to the courts being in recess for the summer.  The average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in the last 5 years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,389 during 2011, an increase of over 32%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,318 in 2011 &mdash; an increase of over 45%.</P>
        <P>Rising prisoner numbers have placed enormous strain on the prison system across the board from accommodation to the provision of services including work training/education, healthcare and drug treatment services.  As a result of the increase in the prison population, a number of prisons  are operating well in excess of their stated bed capacities.  There does appear, however, to be a stabilising or levelling off in the increase in prisoner numbers being committed annually with 2011 recording only a 0.8% increase on the previous year. This compares to increases of 13.6%, 13.8% and 11.4% respectively year on year for 2008, 2009 and 2010.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the recently published Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  In 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013, priority will be given to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre.</P>
        <P>The following table outlines the current bed capacity and the bed capacity as recommended by the Inspector of Prisons:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Significant investment has taken place in our prison estate in recent years with in excess of 900 new prison spaces having been constructed and brought into use since 2007.  A new accommodation block at the Midlands prison which will provide a potential 300 additional spaces as well as additional work training and education facilities, is due to become operational in late 2012.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has commenced the roll out of the Community Return Scheme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release, under which offenders who are assessed as low risk are offered early temporary release, in return for supervised community service. By 16th July 2012, 220 prisoners had participated in the scheme, with 105 having completed their required periods of community service.</P>

	<P>I published the Report into the escape by a prisoner from Loughan House on the 28th March 2012.  As I stated then, the decision to send this prisoner to Loughan House was wrong, and I instructed the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to take all the necessary steps to ensure that a mistake of this nature does not reoccur.  I have been informed by the Director General that measures have been taken to provide additional oversight in the decision making processes in order to ensure that such a decision cannot be made in the future.</P>
        <P>The aims and objectives of open centres are to provide a place of detention aimed at the rehabilitation of offenders.  Open Centres have a regime that includes education, training and work, which encourages a sense of personal responsibility and self respect, in order to assist prisoners leading law-abiding lives on their return to the community. The profile of open centres generally includes, either low risk offenders who are serving short sentences for minor offences, offenders who have engaged constructively with the therapeutic services and have a good disciplinary record, or offenders nearing the end of longer sentences whose transfers have been approved as part of a sentence management programme.  Based on the profile of open centre prisoners, they operate with reduced staffing levels and minimal security.  I am satisfied that the security arrangements in place are satisfactory.</P>
        <P>The recent incident which occurred in Castlerea Prison where two prisoners escaped from the Grove area is being investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A separate investigation is also being conducted by the Irish Prison Service into the circumstances of the escape.  The Grove is an area of semi-open house type accommodation within the perimeter wall of Castlerea Prison.

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended. The on-line Naturalisation Residency Calculator available on the INIS web-site at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>  can be used as a guide to whether an individual  satisfies the naturalisation residency conditions and, if not, give an indication of how long they should wait before making an application.</P>
        <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the spouse of the person referred to by the Deputy in April, 2012.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.  As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 25 February, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One such condition is that the applicant be of good character.</P>
        <P>I am advised that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in September, 2009 and I decided in my absolute discretion to refuse the application. The person concerned was informed of this and the reasons for it in a letter issued on 3 July, 2012. There is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended for appeal in relation to an application for a certificate of naturalisation.  However, the person concerned may make a new application to INIS at any time.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the only manner in which my Department can extract information from its financial record system relating to &ldquo;professional fees&rdquo; is by reference to the automatic deduction of professional withholding tax.  This tax covers a range of professional activities not limited to the examples supplied by the Deputy. However, the listing sought by the Deputy would amount to 711,607 individual transactions, covering 2,796 individual suppliers totalling over &euro;93m . The sheer volume and scale of information sought by the Deputy would make the provision of such unsuitable for transmission via the PQ system. I can, however, inform the Deputy that almost 80% of the total payment is accounted for by payments to legal professionals under the system of criminal legal aid.  The balance is payments to other suppliers of services.</P>

        <P>Of these 475, only one staff member who was a Governor in the Prison Service has been re-employed in the Prison Service on a fixed term contract to meet pressing operational and transformation requirements.

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government and the Garda authorities are fully cognisant of the damaging and negative impact that drug dealing and related anti-social behaviour can have on our city centres.</P>
        <P>It affects not only those who are a part of the business or residential community in the area but also those who visit our city centre on a daily basis, whether for business or pleasure.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a number of highly successful policing initiatives have been implemented by local Garda management in recent times to combat anti-social behaviour, public disorder issues and street-level drug dealing in the city centre. These involve the deployment of uniform and plain-clothes Garda personnel conducting dedicated patrols in key commercial areas and public thoroughfares at strategic times.</P>
        <P>Targeted Garda operations in place in the area include &ldquo;Operation Stilts&rdquo; (tackling anti-social behaviour along the Liffey boardwalk and it&rsquo;s environs). Garda records indicate that, over a two-year period from June 2010 to end June 2012,  a total of just over 10,000 drug searches have taken place in this area and that drugs with an estimated street-value in excess of &euro;290,000 have been seized. This initiative has been extended recently to include additional identified areas, in order to adequately manage the displacement of relevant persons from those areas close to the drug treatment centres, where Garda activity has always been prominent.</P>
        <P>In addition, a fundamental aspect of the recently revised &ldquo;Operation Stilts&rdquo; model is the identification of prolific offenders who frequent the area on a regular basis who are now being specifically targeted and are issued with anti-social behaviour warnings as the circumstances dictate.</P>
        <P>Further initiatives such as  &ldquo;Operation Viking&rdquo; (targeting street-level drug-dealing in the environs of Pearse Street) and &ldquo;Operation Pier&rdquo; (combating and reducing opportunities for public disorder and associated anti-social behaviour in the Temple Bar area) are also in place in the Dublin city centre area.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that there are now forty-four CCTV cameras, which are monitored by Garda personnel from the Garda Camera office on O&rsquo;Connell Street, with a further thirty-three CCTV cameras monitored from Pearse Street Garda Station on a 24-hour basis.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of partnerships have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the business community, including the various transport service providers in the city centre, to address related issues.</P>
        <P>Finally,  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to tackling the overall problem of drug misuse under the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016. I would also like to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to vigorously tackle the illegal supply of drugs at all levels and in all locations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 621 and 622 together.</P>
        <P>Set out in the tables below is the most recently available data, as provided by the Garda authorities, in relation to the information requested.</P>
        <P>The tables show the total number of recorded incidents and arrests in relation to offences under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act  1977 and 1984 (illegal sale or supply offences) by Garda Division and for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 March 2012 inclusive.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to isolate the incidents and arrests relating to the illegal sale of prescription drugs from those relating to drug dealing of non-prescription drugs from the recorded data on the PULSE system. To do so would necessitate a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to conduct an examination of each incident in every Garda Division recorded on that system.</P>
        <P>With regard to the volume, estimated values and type of drug seized, including prescription drugs, the available data in this regard is set out in the Annual Reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While not all of the information requested has traditionally been recorded in the Annual Reports, the Deputy will note that as of 2011 the volume, estimated value and type of drug have been recorded.  The Annual Reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are available at <i>www.garda.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that I am familiar with the Better City for All Report.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Report highlights the clustering of treatment services in the inner city and makes a number of recommendations which are aimed at minimising any negative impact of such clustering on the city centre.</P>
        <P>The Report also acknowledges that treatment services are a major part of the solution to the issues being addressed and that the problems would be worse in their absence.</P>
        <P>While the issue of the location of drug treatment centres is primarily a matter for my colleague R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE), I can inform the Deputy that I am in regular engagement with all of the relevant stakeholders in addressing concerns in relation to anti-social behaviour in the city centre.</P>
        <P>In particular, I would highlight the recent work undertaken with the outgoing Lord Mayor&rsquo;s commission on anti social behaviour. In addition, along with my Government colleagues,  I am working on the development of effective responses to the problems of alcohol and drug abuse which is the root of much of violent street crime. In that context, I have had particular engagement with Minister of State Shortall on issues of mutual concern.</P>
        <P>I also met recently with members of Dublin City Business Improvement District to discuss their concerns about antisocial behaviour in the city.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that this week I also met with the Garda Commissioner, as part of my regular meetings with him, to further discuss these issues.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I will continue to engage with all of the relevant stakeholder so as to ensure that we tackle anti-social behaviour, and its underlying causes, in as comprehensive a manner possible.</P>

	<P>A financial analysis of the scenario posited by the Deputy would require consideration of a wide range of factors, including legal issues and policy considerations, and is not practicable in the absence of a clearer understanding of what might be involved.</P>
        <P>That being said, I am happy to inform the House that the level of cooperation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI has never been higher.  As a result, the two forces are working together seamlessly across a broad range of policing activities.</P>
        <P>Operational policing cooperation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable as well as their respective forces.  Both police chiefs have emphasised the close nature and high quality of the on-going cooperation which is taking place and it has been instrumental in combating serious crime and saving lives.  The overall framework involved is that the two forces operate a Cross-Border Policing Strategy which includes cross-Border investigations and operations.  It also encompasses intelligence-sharing, security, information and communications technology and emergency planning.</P>
        <P>Of course, combating the subversive threat remains an absolute priority for the Garda authorities and their PSNI counterparts.  In that context I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Government is committed to maintaining the highest level of cooperation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI.</P>

	<P>Part IV of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 (as amended) provides for the licensing and conduct of lotteries  (other than the National Lottery). However, as a result of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgement in <i>Bolger v. Doherty (1965)</i>(it held that bingo was a lottery), Part IV of the 1956 Act also applies to bingo.</P>
        <P>Various types of lottery are catered for, one of which requires a permit from a Garda Superintendent (section 27),  while another requires a licence from the district court (section 28). The remainder, in sections 23, 24 and 25, are subject to the provisions in those sections and to Part IV generally but they do not require permits or licences.</P>
        <P>The legislation does not provide for a register of the permits or licences granted. As a result, I am unable at this time to provide the Deputy with details on the number of bingo licences operating here.</P>
        <P>On the matter of profit &mdash; based bingo operations, I refer the Deputy to Section 28 of the 1956 Act. As noted earlier, it provides that lotteries (including bingo) having a prize fund of not more than &euro;20,000 per week require a licence from the district court. However, the section adds that only those lotteries (including bingo) that are in aid of &ldquo;some charitable or philanthropic purpose&rdquo; may be granted a licence.</P>
        <P>The interpretation of section 28 in so far as it concerns the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of the lottery or bingo was a central issue in a recent case before the High Court. I understand that the High Court&rsquo;s judgement, including its interpretation of the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; provision, is being appealed by the State to the Supreme Court. Judgement is awaited.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, as the Deputy is aware, I am preparing comprehensive legislation to update the law on gambling, including bingo. I hope to bring the General Scheme of a new Bill to the Government in the autumn and to publish the Bill in 2013.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda vehicles are retired for a variety of reasons, including where vehicles are considered beyond economic repair, as a result of accidents and, on safety grounds, where patrol vehicles have reached an odometer reading of 300,000 kilometres.<b> </b>   Based on current usage, it is estimated that 213 vehicles may be retired from the fleet by the end of the year.  Due to the fact that Garda cars are re-allocated between Districts on an on-going basis, in the light of operational requirements, a breakdown by Garda District is not available.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that, following a tender process organised by the National Procurement Service, a new contract has been put in place to allow for the provision of Garda cars.

While the Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been submitted to me, I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Fiacla is running for 12 months initially, with effect from February 2012.  The Operation is the subject of regular review by senior Garda management. The Operation is focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.</P>
        <P>Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that to date over 1,300 persons have been arrested and in excess of 800 charges have been proffered.  A dedicated budget has not been established for this initiative and it would necessitate a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to calculate this.  However, every effort is made by Garda management, under the remit of the respective regional policing plans prepared under Operation Fiacla, for duty associated with these initiatives to be conducted as part of routine, rostered, policing duties.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda Management liaise closely with the event-organisers when considering and determining the appropriate deployment of Garda resources at such events, on both public and non-public duties. This involves planning meetings, site inspections, major emergency planning and training and other issues. Full operational policing plans and event management plans are prepared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the organisers. Traffic management plans are also prepared for each event, details of which, including diversions etc., are circulated for the information of all road-users. Personnel deployed on such duties are regularly monitored to ensure optimal deployment.</P>
        <P>Garda Management advises that the specific forthcoming events referred to by the Deputy are to be held at a venue in Rathfarnham Garda sub-District on 23,24 and 25 August, 2012, under the remit of Chief Superintendent, Dublin Metropolitan Region South. In preparing for these events, the senior management team in the Division has held a number of meetings with the organisers of these events to ensure that appropriate measures are in place for the management of the events, including the deployment of sufficient Garda resources and the security / stewarding of the event by the event-organisers. Appropriate risk assessments will also be conducted, taking into consideration the attendance profile, band / entertainer profile and other matters considered relevant. Public safety is, and continues to be, a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in preparing for such events, all relevant stakeholders, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, representatives from the Local Authority, other emergency service providers, event promoters and organisers meet and agree an event management plan which is implemented and which is subject of review following each event.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is examining all issues pertaining to the recent incidents which occurred in the Phoenix Park, including the implementation of the plans which had been in place.  An initial meeting was held with the concert organisers last week and it was agreed that both organisations will carry out a more in depth review regarding all aspects of the event. The fact is that the arrangements which were in place on the Saturday night did not prevent the type of behaviour which took place.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has undertaken to let me have a report following that review and I can assure the Deputy that I am determined any lessons will be taken fully into account in future planning and risk management of such events.</P>

	<P>A Value for Money Review (VFM) of the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the recommendations arising from this review will inform future plans for the Reserve.  In December last I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from three to two. As I have previously outlined, this re-organisation will necessarily impact on the Reserve, as the Army Reserve organisation mirrors that of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) i.e., a three Brigade structure. I have recently announced details of the re-organisation of the PDF. As part of this re-organisation, the number of PDF personnel available to work full time with the Reserve is being reduced. This is required as part of the prioritisation of PDF operational outputs.</P>
        <P>The recommendations regarding future plans for the Reserve, including organisational structures will be brought forward as part of the VFM process. These recommendations must ensure that RDF organisational structures dovetail with revised PDF structures and have regard to the reduced availability of full time PDF support personnel. This will include alternative approaches to administration and support of the Reserve such as having co-located RDF Unit requirements met by PDF Units.</P>
        <P>The Steering Committee met most recently on the 12th July last, and drafting of the Review is continuing. I have asked the Steering Committee to progress the Review as quickly as possible and I anticipate its completion by the end of September.</P>

	<P>Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government stabilised the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  In response, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces both permanent and reserve. It is not viable to retain a three brigade structure within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel. Accordingly, the re-organisation encompasses a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from the current three to two.  Details of the re-organisation were announced by me earlier this week in a press release published on the Department of Defence website. This clarified the position with regard to An Ch&eacute;ad Chathl&aacute;n Coisithe, which is retained as a full infantry battalion in the new organisational structure for 9,500 personnel.</P>

	<P>Contrary to recent assertions, my decision to initiate a re-organisation was made following a detailed assessment of the Defence and Security environment and consideration of associated Defence Forces capability requirements, as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). This is also reflected in the Department of Defence and Defence Forces&rsquo; Strategy Statement and both of these documents have been published and are available for viewing.    The outcome of the CRE process outlined the resource envelope that is available for Defence in the coming years.  Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government stabilised the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel.  In response, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces. It is not viable to retain a three brigade structure within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel. Accordingly, the re-organisation encompasses a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from the current three to two. This re-organisation is driven by the immediate realities of retaining operational effectiveness within a strength ceiling of 9,500 and an austere resource provision. This is a pressing issue that must be completed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Details of the re-organisation were announced by me earlier this week and, as part of this process, the 4th Infantry Battalion will be disestablished. The projected strength levels for the 9,500 organisation will see numbers based in Collins Barracks, Cork, remain largely unchanged.  I have been advised that the re-organisation will ensure the Permanent Defence Force can continue to meet all operational requirements, both at home and overseas.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing on the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. When published at the end of 2012, this Green Paper will inform broad discussion about Ireland&rsquo;s Defence policy. This will culminate in the publication of a new White Paper on Defence at the end of 2013. This White Paper will encompass a longer time frame than that of the Strategy Statement and inform long term capability requirements for implementation over an extended timeframe.</P>

	<P>The tabular statement below sets out the number of promotions which have occurred or are in train to the end of July, 2012 in the Permanent Defence Force.  Competitions for promotions for enlisted personnel are currently ongoing following agreement with the Representative Association, PDFORRA, on the new promotion scheme for enlisted personnel in February.  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are very large numbers of personnel involved in these competitions.  However, I expect the process to be completed shortly.     In relation to promotions over the remainder of 2012, as Deputies will be aware, I announced a major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force on Tuesday, 17 July, 2012.  The reorganisation will involve the relocation of Permanent Defence Force units and personnel and the disestablishment of certain units. At this stage I do not have detailed information as to which personnel may move to new locations with their units or the number of personnel who will wish to remain in the locations affected by the reorganisation.  These issues, including the effect of the changes on promotion posts to be filled and the location of such posts are currently being worked through as part of the implementation process which includes discussions with the Representatives Associations.  Therefore, it is not possible to definitely state at this time where and what promotions will be implemented over the remainder of this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The gross total allocation for Defence related expenditure in 2012 is &euro;902m, comprising of &euro;688m for the Defence Vote and &euro;214m for the Army Pensions Vote. The 2012 allocation was based on a comprehensive evaluation of expected pay and non-pay Defence requirements within the 2012 to 2014 timeframe and was agreed following the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) process undertaken in 2011. The 2012 allocation, while less than previous years, should ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped to meet the various tasks assigned to them by Government within an agreed strength ceiling of 9,500.   Procedures are in place to ensure that expenditure is profiled and monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, a number of high level civil/military groups such as the Strategic Management Committee (SMC) and the High Level Planning and Procurement Group (HLPPG) meet regularly to evaluate ongoing expenditure trends, prioritise future requirements and maintain oversight on key external issues likely to impact on expenditure.</P>
        <P>At the end of June 2012, gross non-pay expenditure was some &euro;6m (8%) below anticipated expenditure in the same period. This variation arises generally from timing issues with procurement.</P>
        <P>At the end of June 2012, gross pay expenditure was &euro;11m (4%) below anticipated expenditure in the same period   due largely to the significant numbers that retired from the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in the earlier part of the year. As the PDF is below its agreed strength of 9,500 it is intended that recruitment will be undertaken in 2012, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, and this process is currently underway. There are no savings on the Army Pensions Vote.</P>

	<P>A number of farmers in the area concerned are in receipt of payment from my Department under Rural Environment Protection Scheme and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS). I am actively considering the possibility of re-opening AEOS to allow for the submission of new applications this year either on an amended basis from the existing scheme and/or on a limited scale. However, there are strict budgetary constraints in place and, as a result, the management of the limited resources represents a very challenging situation involving difficult choices. The full year cost of any new scheme will have to be met in 2013 and any decision to re-open AEOS will be taken in the context of consideration of the resources available and the need to remain within the agreed expenditure ceiling for my Department in 2013. I will make an announcement as soon as I have reached a decision on the situation. </P>

	<P>The application referred to is in respect of a site located within Ardgroom Harbour, Kenmare Bay which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Natura 2000 area).  All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be &lsquo;appropriately assessed&rsquo; for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and/or Habitats Directives.  Accordingly, this application is required to be &lsquo;appropriately assessed&rsquo; as part of the licensing process. </P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of &lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</P>
        <P>Addressing the issue of aquaculture licensing in Natura 2000 areas is a key priority for my Department and the Deputy can be assured that every effort is being made to expedite the determination of this aquaculture licence application having regard to all the complexities involved and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that I have sought the approval of the EU Commissioner to allow the payment of a 50% advance of the Single Payment with effect from 16 October, the earliest payment date possible, it being the first day of the new EU financial year. I understand that a number of other Member States have also made similar requests. I am both particularly mindful of the importance of the Single Payment to individual farmers and also of the benefit to the wider rural community and, in light of ongoing general financial difficulties, but particularly the recent very unseasonable weather, I have decided to approach the Commissioner, as indicated.</P>
        <P>In a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner yesterday I addressed the issue of advance payment in view of the effects of the weather on farming and asked if the Commission would consider going beyond the 50% to a 70% advance. However, the Commissioner raised some practical concerns around doing so.</P>

Expenditure covers a wide range of activities including payments to farmers under various schemes, food safety, animal and public health areas and Grants-in Aid to State bodies. Actual expenditure in any year is dependent on a number of variables such as the level of scheme participation, fully documented claims being lodged and the incidence of animal disease. </P>

	<P>The maximum grant available was &euro;50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to childcare settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment. </P>
        <P>Following a robust appraisal of all applications received, 290 applications were approved for funding with the average amount approved being &euro;21,000.   Of the total number of applications approved, 125 were from  private childcare facilities.  Of the total amount approved, 63% was approved for renovation/expansion works, 25% was approved for the purchase of equipment, 11% for maintenance works, and 0.5% was in respect of professional fees associated with the capital works.</P>
        <P>The figures available to my Department are broken down in line with the City and County Childcare Committee structures.   The figures for Kildare  indicates that 5 applications were approved for funding.  The total funding approved for these groups amounts to &euro; 92,764.</P>
        <P>The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment is not allocated on a geographical basis but has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works, and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Child Care Act 1991 the Health Service Executive has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The majority of children in care are in foster care, one third of whom are placed with relatives. </P>
        <P>General foster care applicants undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence. This process has six stages:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Application.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Assessment by a social worker.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Garda vetting, medical and  referenced checks (including garda checks of adult children of the foster carers living at home).</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Approval by the Fostering Committee &mdash; specific age/type of foster care.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Approval of the &lsquo;match&rsquo; between the  foster carers with the Care Plan of the prospective  child.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Placement of a child with the foster carers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When a child is being placed in foster care, the suitability of a placement with relatives is explored in the first instance. Where the HSE is satisfied that an immediate placement with relatives is in the interests of the child, such placement frequently occurs before full approval of the committee is in place. Such emergency placements are provided for in Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) regulations, 1995. Prior to and during the early stages of a placement, the relative is assessed by a principal social worker, including early Garda vetting. This is followed by a full assessment and approval by the foster care committee as outlined above.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers to a figure of 630 foster carers. This figure relates to December 2011 and refers to the number of foster carers that had not yet been fully approved by the Foster Care Committee. It should be noted that 540 of these were relatives of the child in care.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that a child being placed in a placement awaiting final approval does not necessarily equate with a child being placed with a family that has not been vetted.</P>
        <P>I am happy to advise the Deputy that progress has been made in recent months in reducing the numbers of foster careers awaiting final approval. This follows the Government&rsquo;s decision to make an additional budgeting provision of &euro;19m for child welfare and protection services in 2012.</P>
        <P>At the end of March 2012, I am advised by the HSE that 505 foster carers were awaiting final approval by the foster care panel, 417 of whom, were relatives of the child in care.</P>
        <P>Foster care assessments can take a number of months to complete, due to their comprehensive nature.</P>

	<P>There are  three  designated special care units in the country where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety. There is a unit in  Ballydowd in Dublin, which has a capacity of  10 beds, another in Gleann &Aacute;lainn in Cork with a capacity of 5 beds and Coovagh House in Limerick with a capacity of 5 beds, although I am advised by the HSE that admissions to Coovagh House are capped at 2 for the present time following refurbishment of the unit.  </P>
        <P>There are two National High Support Units in Ireland, Rath Na n&Oacute;g, Castleblaney and Crann&oacute;g Nua, Portrane with a total of 16 places.   With respect to the other matters raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE for the most up to date figures and I will correspond directly with the Deputy when these are received.</P>

	<P>Adoptions from Russia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013. </P>
        <P>As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010.  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>It is the role of the Adoption Authority to make an assessment of whether the inter-country adoption legislation and practices in a non-contracting state, in this case Russia, are in compliance with both Irish legislation and the principles of the Hague Convention. As part of this assessment the Adoption Authority has reviewed a draft bilateral agreement presented to it during previous discussions with its Russian counterparts and has provided me with an initial assessment in this regard. As a result of this, the issues which may require further exploration with the Russian authorities have been considered. I have recently asked the Adoption Authority to engage further with the Russian authorities on issues raised in their report to me.</P>
        <P>My Department has also requested the further advices of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in relation to the requirement for post placement reports in the context of intercountry adoption.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development, to support parents and to help to break the inter-generational cycle of disadvantage.  The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard.  This year some 66,000 children throughout the country will benefit from the free preschool year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, while some 26,000 children, in low income households, will benefit under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides places in a range of childcare settings in local communities.  Under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, a further 2,800 places are available for children of parents in training programmes.   In 2012, some &euro;230 million in all will be provided by my Department for these schemes designed to support young children&rsquo;s social and educational development.</P>
        <P>My Department also supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services, including programmes for young people living in disadvantaged communities.In 2012, funding of&euro;56.6 million will be invested in provision for youth.  The programmes are delivered by the voluntary youth work sector.  They include &lsquo;out of school&rsquo; projects in non formal education settings and projects which aim to divert &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; young people in disadvantaged areas from the dangers of substance misuse; as well as the provision of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs which are used by some 535,000 young people throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board, under the remit of my Department, as part of its responsibilities is charged with developing the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme to address the needs of children who may experience difficulties in fully participating in education.  These programmes and the results of pilot projects to enhance children&rsquo;s development in Tallaght, Northside and Ballymun, which are jointly funded by my Department with a philanthropic organisation, will inform the Government&rsquo;s plans to develop a new area based approach to child poverty.  One of my priorities, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.Submissions from the members of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme will of course be considered in this regard.</P>

	<P>The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act 1991.  Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.  On reaching 18 years of age, they are no longer under the care of the state under the Child Care Act 1991 and are referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision in the direct provision system.  However, the HSE is committed to ensuring continuity of care for all young people who are undertaking their leaving certificate and therefore interprets &ldquo;18th birthday&rdquo;  as the end of a school year/leaving certificate year following their 18th birthday.  The HSE and the RIA have an agreed policy in relation to the accommodation of separated children seeking asylum who reach the age of 18 years and there is regular liaison between the two agencies.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy regarding the number of young asylum seekers who are not in the care of the state, but are being supported by the HSE and the number of years each young person has been in the care of the state.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has statutory responsibility for  the other information requested about  asylum seekers.</P>

	<P>The Task Force which was set up to advise on the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, has submitted its final report to me.  The report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and launched tomorrow, Friday 20th July.  The report contains advice on a number of key issues which will inform the preparation of the necessary legislation to establish the new Agency.  This includes advice on those services considered by the Task Force as falling within the remit of the Agency. The recommendations deserve careful and detailed consideration by myself and my officials.  I will also need to consult with my Ministerial colleagues whose areas of responsibilities are referred to in the report.</P>
        <P>Extensive work is under way in my Department, and in the HSE, to prepare for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency.  I am satisfied that we are making excellent progress in terms of the necessary preparatory work required to meet the Government&rsquo;s ambitious timetable, which will see the Agency assuming full statutory responsibility for services for children and families early in 2013.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 708 and 778 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government, recognising that consultants remuneration rates are relatively high, provides for a reduction. However, my immediate priority is to achieve more effective implementation of the existing contract and to reform how services are delivered to patients.  I am satisfied that considerable efficiencies can be achieved under the terms of the 2008 contract and the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, if consultants embrace this reform agenda.  I believe that the efficiencies, productivity increases and reform, if achieved, will be worth more to the health system than simply reducing the pay of consultants and the Government has endorsed this approach.</P>
        <P>Consultations with the consultant representative bodies under the Public Service Agreement framework commenced on 16th May.  Management submitted detailed proposals to the representative bodies on 17th May for consideration.  A meeting between the parties took place on 17th July and a further meeting is scheduled for 24th July.  I have previously stated that this process needs to be focussed on the achievement of worthwhile and measurable change and must also be concluded within a reasonable period, in line with the provisions of the Public Service Agreement.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in consultant numbers over the past 10 years.  However, given the State&rsquo;s financial position, the health sector is subject to overall Government policy on recruitment and must make an appropriate contribution to the commitment to reduce public service numbers.  Health employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 by the end of this year.  Any further consultant appointments made must be within this policy context.</P>

	<P>A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist. A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to imposing additional controls on certain prescription drugs such as benzodiazepine and z-drug medicines being traded illicitly.  Part of that review includes a wide-ranging consultation process with key stakeholders, including the IMB and the Department of Justice as well as Customs and the Garda Sioch&aacute;na, on proposed amendments to the Regulations.  These proposed amendments include the introduction of an offence of possession as well as import and export controls on such drugs, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na.  The views expressed during the consultation process, now nearly complete, will be considered in any decision taken regarding amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations.  In accordance with EU law, it may be necessary to notify the EU Commission and Member States of the proposed regulations which would impose a 3 month standstill period on the making of the regulations.</P>
        <P>While it is impossible to state when the amending regulations will be finalised, the matter is being progressed as quickly as possible in my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that the enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</P>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.

	<P>The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.  As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, GP care without fees within its first term of office. Primary legislation is required to give effect to Government commitment to introduce a universal GP service without fees.  Legislation to allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses is currently being drafted by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and will be published shortly. Implementation dates and application details will be announced in due course.</P>

	<P>The HSE is facing a significant challenge in 2012 given the need to set expenditure levels within the parameters of the National Recovery Plan. The health sector has experienced a significant reduction over the last three years, both budgetary and staffing. Notwithstanding these constraints the following has been achieved:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the HSE has operated the Croke Park Agreement very effectively, with over 3,500 staff redeployed, and a reduction in overall numbers of over 6,000;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a range of measures are being actively progressed during 2012 to enhance income collection;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a 7% increase in in-patient discharges and a 6% increase in ED admissions;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />in relation to a basket of 24 procedures, the national target of 75% of cases treated as day cases has been achieved;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />significant improvements in hospital waiting times, with 9,100 fewer patients waiting on trolleys when compared to the same period in 2011. This equates to a 19% year-on-year improvement;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />implementation of clinical programmes which saved 70,000 bed days last year, thereby allowing for more patients to be treated more efficiently;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />cost reductions within the health sector which are impressive by international standards, particularly within the hospital sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />1.8m people now with medical cards, and 130,000 with GP visit cards;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />legislation to abolish restrictions on GPs wishing to become contractors under the GMS was passed and has come into effect;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />significant advances in mental health services in the implementation of A Vision for Change, in particular improved child and adolescent mental health services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />advances in the care of older people, with almost 23,000 clients now supported under Fair Deal;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was recently published and is being introduced in the Seanad today.  The Bill provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Currently, when a specific brand of medicine is prescribed for a patient, a pharmacist can only supply that particular brand, even when less expensive generic versions of the same medicine are available.  The Bill permits pharmacists to substitute medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
        <P>Primary care facilities will be developed at twenty locations across the country using the public private partnership mechanism.  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the delivery of health care in the primary care setting.  This PPP initiative will complement and build on the processes HSE has already in place in its capital programme.  Primary care infrastructure development, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary health care and represents a tangible refocusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.  The Exchequer will continue to fund the delivery of Primary Care Centres also.</P>
        <P>On 17th July 2012, I announced the planned recruitment of over 270 new staff to work in Primary Care, funded by a special allocation of &euro;20m which was set aside as part of the HSE&rsquo;s 2012 National Service Plan.  The funding will provide for the employment of 17 Clinical Nurse Specialists to support the Integrated Care Diabetes Programme and some 255 other Primary Care Team posts, including Public Health Nurses, Registered General Nurses, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists and Speech and Language Therapists.</P>
        <P>I can also report progress in chronic disease management, particularly for the management of diabetes and on the preparation of legislation to allow for the extension of free GP care to persons with long term illnesses.</P>
        <P>In relation to the governance of the HSE,  the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 was published on 18th   July.  The legislation will allow the putting in place of a Director General and six new Directorates, closely aligned to specific areas of service such as primary care, mental health, hospitals and more.  The new structure will allow a reorganisation of services to prepare the way for the wider introduction of the &lsquo;money follows the patient principle&rsquo; and the ultimate introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 will:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) abolish the Board structure of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and provide for a Directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board, headed by a Director General;</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) provide for further accountability arrangements for the HSE; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(iii) provide for related matters including a number of technical amendments to take account of the replacement of the Board structure by the Directorate structure.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My priority over the next twelve months will be to accelerate the type of service delivery reforms that will move to models of care across all service/care groups which treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide services at the best possible unit cost.  We will move further towards a health system that provides access based on need rather than income, underpinned by a strengthened primary care sector, a restructured hospital sector and a more transparent &ldquo;money follows the patient&rdquo; system of funding that will be supported ultimately by Universal Health Insurance.</P>
        <P>I have referred the other matters raised by the Deputy to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy might be aware, the European Court of Human Rights heard in December 2009 an application by three women that it is a breach of their rights under the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights for the Irish State not to provide abortion in circumstances where a woman wishes to undergo an abortion (the <i>A, B and C </i>case).  The judgment of the Court confirmed that Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution is in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Court accepted that Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case, provides that it is lawful to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, which can only avoided by a termination of the pregnancy. This has not been altered by this judgment.  The Court ruled that &ldquo;no criteria or procedures have been... laid down in Irish law... by which that risk is to be measured or determined, leading to uncertainty&rdquo; and held that further legal clarity was required.</P>
        <P>On foot of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i> case, and to fulfil a commitment included in the Programme for Government, the Government established an Expert Group on 13th January 2012<b> </b>to make recommendations on how this matter should be properly addressed.  The Group, chaired by Hon Justice Mr. Sean Ryan, has made very good progress and is currently in the process of finalising its report.  However, the Group requested a short extension to the time limit it was given to complete its work.  They expect their report will be completed and submitted to me by the end of September and I will subsequently submit it to Government.</P>

This was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th Amendment of the Constitution.  As I cannot proceed as proposed, I am now considering how best to deal with the issues involved.  I have to taken into account the fact that Garda investigations are continuing with investigation files having been submitted to the DPP and I understand that there are civil cases pending.  It would be wrong to initiate any other inquiry that might impede these investigations and possible cases.  However, I remain determined to reach a fair and satisfactory outcome which will help to five closure to the victims concerned.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Substance Misuse Strategy, was published earlier this year.  It contained many recommendations and policy options in relation to tackling the over-consumption of alcohol in Ireland.  Among the suggested options was the introduction of minimum pricing.</P>
        <P>A proposal on this and other alcohol-related issues has been prepared for Government.  It includes a strong recommendation on the introduction of minimum pricing to deal with the problems associated with low-priced alcohol.  A decision of the Cabinet is awaited.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 736 to 738,  inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There has been no change to Government policy which is support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible. This , as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through a range of community based services such as Home Help, Home Care Packages,  and a range of Day Care or Respite Care provision at local level. Where it is not possible to maintain an older person at home, the policy is to support access to quality long-term residential care.</P>
        <P>The central challenge facing the health service this year, and indeed for the foreseeable future, is how to best meet the needs of older people for health and personal social services, in the light of  diminishing  resources and competing demands.  This requires prioritising services, including Day Care services, towards those in greatest need  while at the same time, pursuing planned reform and effectiveness of services overall. In this context, the issues raised by the Deputy are being kept under review, both in terms of the HSE managing its Service Plan for this year, and by the Government in agreeing the next Budget.</P>

Resources are available to roll out the programme at the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>Screening will identify people with either pre-cancerous polyps or early stage cancer, so they can be treated in a timely fashion, thus preventing significant morbidity and mortality which are associated with colorectal cancer.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 750 and 751 together.  </P>
        <P>The Minister has set a target that, by the end of  2012, that no patient should have to wait more than 13 weeks for routine GI endoscopy (that is either a colonoscopy or gastroscopy ) once placed on a hospital daycase waiting list.  This is an extremely challenging and ambitious target and in order to support hospitals in reaching this target the SDU has commenced a GI Endoscopy Performance Improvement Programme that encompasses the SDU, National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI), Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the HSE.  The aim in the short term is to eliminate long waiters (those patients waiting greater than 3 months) with the NTPF agreeing programmes of support with individual hospitals that will see the longest waiters having their procedure. This will enable the hospital system to undertake up to 13,000 additional GI endoscopy procedures this year. The medium and long term aim is to ensure clinically appropriate referrals, standardised pathways of care, sustainable short waits, position units to successfully complete JAG accreditation and ultimately achieve better outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>Below are the latest monthly figures for national waiting list data on colonoscopies.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has recently published the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012.  This Bill, when enacted, shall provide for a system of reference pricing and generic substitution which will drive price competition in the generics market.  Forecasts from the pharmaceutical industry demonstrate that a large number of currently patent protected drugs are to lose this protection in the coming years.  This being the case the savings to be achieved though the proposed system will increase accordingly.</P>

	<P>Since 1 January 2012 the charges for patients who chose to be treated on a private basis in public hospitals have increased by between 3% and 5% depending on the category of hospital.  The increase in charges is in keeping with the long-standing policy of moving towards recovering the full economic cost of providing treatment to private patients in public hospitals.  It is anticipated that the increased charges will yield additional revenue in the region of &euro;18 million in 2012.  The current 2012 charges and the 2011 charges are set out in the following table:</P>

	<P>I am very aware of the potential for savings which can be made through an all-island approach to healthcare in all of the above areas.  There is already a very good level of cooperation in existence between the service providers in both jurisdictions in the border corridor, led and supported by the Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT) organisation, which has promoted positive working relationships and collaborative effort since it was established 20 years ago, and by Senior service managers in both jurisdictions.

This is of particular relevance  in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward  health reform.</P>
        <P>At a departmental level co-operation between  the two jurisdictions  is active and ongoing.  &ldquo;Transforming Your Care: a Review of Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland&rdquo; also recommends co-operation on a number of key issues.

There are a number of definitions of disability that are used for particular purposes e.g. Disability Act, Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act, Equal Status Act, the Census and qualifying criteria for income supports such as Domiciliary Care Allowance, Disability Allowance, Mobility Allowance etc.  These definitions define disability in terms of an individual&rsquo;s functional ability in their environment rather than a medical diagnosis or condition.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 799 and 800 together.</P>
        <P>Fibromyalgia is a distinct condition under the international classification of diseases which is the international standard by which diseases are classified which is accepted by Ireland and is endorsed by the World Health Organisation.  There are no plans to change training arrangements or the range of supports available to patients with fibromyalgia.  People with fibromyalgia have access to the broad range of primary, community and hospital based services for the diagnosis and treatment of their condition. Individuals may also be entitled to a medical card depending on their circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Social Protection has confirmed that Fibromyalgia is accepted as a certifiable medical condition.  Eligibility to its illness related benefit/allowance schemes is determined by the condition&rsquo;s severity and expected duration.  The medical assessment is made in accordance with that Department&rsquo;s evidence based medical guidelines/protocols.  Insofar as the Department of Health is concerned, the position is that there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 802 and 805 together.</P>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council, established in 2007 and the 12 registration boards being established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (the Act), will be responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the  registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles.  The regulation of the 12 professions designated under the Act is being implemented on a phased basis and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is intended that the remaining 10 registration boards and their registers will be established by end 2014.</P>
        <P>While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include,  if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate.  Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners;</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) The profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development;</P>
        <P LI="1">(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;</P>
        <P LI="1">(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department&rsquo;s priority is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions designated under the Act.  The extension of statutory registration arrangements under the Act for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated  professions are fully in place.  Questions relating to the recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.  Any proposals relating to grade and pay levels would, of course, require the approval of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

	<P>EU Regulation 1408/71 facilitates free movement of workers and others within the EU by providing for coordination between member states&rsquo; healthcare and social security systems.  In relation to healthcare, its provisions ensure that where people are covered by the healthcare system of one member state, but residing or staying in another member state, they can access the public healthcare system of that member state under certain conditions.  The Regulation provides for the reimbursement of such costs between member states.  </P>
        <P>Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) have, since 1973, operated a bilateral reimbursement agreement for the costs of healthcare provided under the above Regulation, whereby net liability is calculated on a lump sum (based on the average cost of healthcare in each country for the year concerned as approved at EU level), rather than an individual, basis, in respect of the following three categories of persons:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) Pensioners and their dependants.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) Temporary visitors.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) Dependant families of workers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Pensioner costs account for the major portion of the total payment.  The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable is based on a sample survey by both administrations undertaken every three years, the agreed results of which is applied to the total pensioner number.  This methodology has been under discussion and in 2011 both administrations agreed in principle to work towards a form of pensioner registration commencing in 2012 and agreed interim arrangements, based on previous survey results trends, for determining pensioner liability pending the implementation of same.</P>

	<P>I should like to congratulate the club on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League and I wish them every success in the competition.   The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the allocation of current funding to sports organisations. The ISC channels funding through the National Governing Bodies of sport. In the case of football, funding is provided to the FAI. The Irish Sports Council has no mechanism by which funding can be provided to individual clubs outside of this process.  </P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I have no discretionary funding available to me to assist the club. I would suggest that the club approach the FAI in this matter. The FAI receive considerable funding from the Irish Sports Council to support its activities as well as to support women in sport.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as LUAS BXD, comes under the remit of the NTA.</P>
        <P>The allocation for BXD for 2012 is therefore a matter for the NTA having regard to the current state of progress  as regards the project which still awaits planning approval.  The spend to end 2011 as reported to me by the NTA was &euro;11.7 million. </P>

        <P>There are currently 18 individuals in my Department who receive gross salaries in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum.  When pension levy, tax and other statutory deductions are taken into account, the net sum received by each individual is less than &euro;100,000.</P>
        <P>If wages were to be capped at &euro;100,000 per annum the reduction on gross salary would amount to &euro;400,000.  The net saving to the State would be closer to 1/3 of this of this owing to the high marginal rate of tax and social charges as well as the pension related deductions.</P>
        <P>have asked the State agencies under the aegis of my Department to provide the Deputy with the information requested. If you do not receive a reply within ten working days, please contact my private office.</P>

	<P>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport reimburses staff for official travel only. The Travel and Subsistence allowances are paid only in respect of necessary absence from headquarters. All travelling duties must be planned in order to reduce the total amount of travel to the minimum consistent with efficiency. This is enshrined in the Departments Travel policy document which reflects the Department of Finance Circular 11/1982 &ldquo;Travelling and Subsistence Regulations&rdquo; and &ldquo;Foreign Policy Guidelines 2009&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The total spend on Travel and Subsistence for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 was &euro;775,602. </P>
        <P>The amount paid to individual staff members is designed to provide reimbursement for out of pocket expenses incurred by them. On a simple average basis, the amount paid is &euro;3,641 per member of staff who submit a travel claim. In practice the amount of payment to individual staff members will vary considerably.</P>

        <P>In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act (as amended).  The contracts for the privately-operated toll schemes are, therefore, commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned.  I understand that no Exchequer funds have been expended in respect of such payments for 2012 so far this year. It is not possible to give definitive figures for 2013 at this remove.</P>
        <P>Two PPP contracts, the M3 Clonee-Kells PPP and the Limerick Tunnel PPP, incorporate a traffic guarantee mechanism. With regard to the remaining PPP schemes, all traffic risk remains with the operator while the State stands to benefit from the revenue share arrangement where the average daily traffic (&ldquo;ADT&rdquo;) exceeds scheme specific pre-defined threshold traffic.</P>

	<P>The functions of the Road Safety Authority are set out in the Road Safety Authority Act 2006.  While I do not have any plans to privatise those functions, section 5 of the 2006 Act provides for the Authority, with the consent of the Minister and the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to outsource the performance of its functions.  However, such outsourcing does not remove or derogate from the Authority&rsquo;s responsibility to me for the performance of any function so outsourced.</P>

        <P>Under EU law and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended, existing public service obligation (PSO) bus and rail services can be procured by the National Transport Authority through direct award contracts and any other new subvented services must be procured by way of open tendering. At the expiry of the current 5 year direct award contracts for the provision of PSO services with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann the NTA have discretion to renew, modify or terminate the direct award provision of bus services following a consultation process with interested parties under which the NTA is obliged to justify its approach.</P>
        <P>A  public consultation on 2014 Bus Public Service Contracts, as required by the legislation, commenced on 14th June and concluded on 11th July, 2012. The NTA is considering whether to undertake one or more procurement competitions for the award of part or all of these contracts, or it may decide to directly award part or all of these contracts to the existing contracted parties.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government to explore the benefit to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision, I will be consulting with my Ministerial colleagues on the future options for procurement of PSO bus services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 834 and 835 together. </P>
        <P>It is not possible to quantify the information sought by the Deputy given the varying tax treatment of couples and single people.  In the case of commercial agencies, neither the CEO salaries nor the board members&rsquo; fees are a charge on the Exchequer, so there would in fact be a net loss to the Exchequer (arising from foregone income tax and other statutory deductions) if these were reduced.  In the case of non-commercial agencies, the net impact would depend on the tax allowances and bands of the individuals concerned.</P>
        <P>I have no plans, nor am I currently examining the effect of, the introduction of a unilateral pay cap at &euro;100,000 for commercial and non-commercial state agencies under the aegis of my Department.  To do so would be a breach of the Croke Park agreement. Nor am I contemplating or examining the effect of a reduction in Board Fees.  Both are set in accordance with general Government pay policy for the agencies under my aegis. Under this, the fees paid to board members range from &euro;1,575 in the case of some of the smaller port companies to &euro;31,500 for the chairpersons of CIE and the DAA. These fees are paid before tax and are relatively modest given the work and responsibility involved.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware in this context that the Government supports a strong policy of pay restraint in the public sector as evidenced by the announced pay caps and revised salary levels for Chief Executives and other senior management in both the commercial and non-commercial state agencies.  </P>
        <P>Having said that, strong boards and strong senior management are absolutely essential if our State agencies are to make the contribution that we require to economic recovery. It would be a mistake in my view to reduce remuneration to levels which are potentially not sufficient to attract the calibre of personnel that we need.</P>
