    <Title>Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

        <P>Deputy Robert Dowds is sharing time with Deputies Eamonn Maloney and Terence Flanagan.  They will have five minutes each.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertDowds"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
        <P>I warmly welcome the Personal Insolvency Bill and wish to thank the Minister for Justice and Equality and all who have had an input into drafting this extraordinarily difficult piece of legislation.  New Beginnings, a lawyers&rsquo; group, has stated: &ldquo;This Bill has the potential to keep thousands in their homes as these new measures could help defuse an economic and social time-bomb, and this is a significant step on the road to recovery&rdquo;.  Two other ways of pointing to the need for this Bill are, first, the EU-IMF agreement recognised the need for legislation of this sort and, second, given that personal debt levels in the Irish Republic are the highest in Europe, it is hardly surprising that legislation of this sort is required. </P>
        <P>The Bill is an essential element towards getting this country and its people standing on their own feet again.  Assuming the Bill operates as intended, it will enable people in great debt to participate more effectively in the economy thereby helping to keep more people at work, as those in debt begin to spend again and generate demand for goods and services.</P>
        <P>Like other Deputies, I am glad that under the personal insolvency arrangement, it is possible for people in trouble with mortgages to come to a realistic settlement.  In reality, many people are trying to cope with mortgages for houses that are only worth a fraction of the purchase price.  This is so important in terms of those people being able to live their lives and participate in their local economies without such an enormous burden.</P>
        <P>I am particularly glad that part of this Bill deals with the debt problems of people who effectively have no assets.  It is most important that they should be assisted along with, for example, those with severe mortgage problems.  I wonder how the conditions will work in practice for those who are eligible for a debt-relief notice.  According to sections 40 and 41, it is clearly in the interest of a person with a debt-relief notice to stick to his or her bargain, particularly as he or she will be responsible for all debt if the notice is terminated.  Can I presume that when a debt-relief notice or personal insolvency arrangement is being drawn up, the intermediary and personal insolvency practitioner will have a clear financial guide to determine what is reasonable expenditure for the individual or family concerned?</P>
        <P>I understand from a briefing by FLAC and other groups that the Vincentian Partnership has come up with a good system for doing this.  I ask the Minister to examine that system.  I am glad to see involvement of MABS in issuing debt-relief notices because that service already has an expertise in helping people in this situation.  I hope that MABS will be adequately resourced to deal with debt-relief notices and to provide advice on all of the new insolvency options.  Given the track record of MABS, it is a particularly useful service concerning the issues surrounding this Bill.</P>
        <P>I presume the Minister is aware of the concerns about the Bill being raised by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and other relevant Ministers should monitor any impact this Bill has on the credit unions&rsquo; ability to function.  Given the importance of credit unions, particularly for small borrowers, it would be a severe setback if any of them were unable to lend due to lack of finance.  In these circumstances, I presume the Minister for Finance would help the relevant credit unions over the hump.</P>
        <P>There is some concern that the debt ceiling of &euro;20,000 may not be a high enough figure.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on that matter in his reply to the debate.  Another provision in the Bill which I welcome is the reduction in the period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three years.</P>
        <P>A concern that I have in terms of how this proposed legislation will be received is the question of begrudgery.  When speaking about this Bill, it is important that public representatives make it clear that people who are insolvent are in a very bad place and that it is in society&rsquo;s interest to give them a helping hand.  I am concerned that there is no possibility of appeal if creditors reject a personal insolvency arrangement proposal.  The debtor must go through a lengthy process at the end of which he or she may be left with nothing to show for the effort.  It is also worrying that there is no provision for people who cannot afford to hire a personal insolvency practitioner but who need to get out from under a secured debt, such as a mortgage.</P>
        <P>Given that this legislation is ground-breaking, I would urge that its operation should be reviewed after a year or so to see how it is working in practice.  Flaws that are uncovered during the first year should be dealt with at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
        <P>In common with other Deputies, I commend the Minister and his staff for drafting this historic legislation.  It is perhaps regrettable that such a Bill is required but that is where our economy is.  I have listened to the debate unfolding and I wish to confine my remarks to the credit union movement, which is the working man&rsquo;s bank.  While many of the contributions thus far in the debate have been interesting, they focused on secured and unsecured debt in the banking sector.  I want to, however, focus on the credit union movement which, in my view, will be negatively affected and disadvantaged by the schemes provided for in this Bill.  For example, the Bill provides for the introduction of debt relief notices, which will address secured and unsecured debts of less than &euro;20,000.  Given a substantial number of borrowers fall into this category, credit unions will be disproportionately affected.  It is hoped this issue will be addressed by the Minister.  I appeal to him to ensure we do not end up with a Bill which leads to the situation whereby those on low incomes or on social welfare are prohibited from ever borrowing again.  We are all aware of the history of the credit union movement.  That people are on low incomes does not mean they cannot honour their debts.  The credit union movement states that they are.</P>
        <P>We must not legislate in a way which results in people on social welfare or low incomes being thrown back into the arms of unlicensed money lenders.  That would be a retrograde step.  I ask that the Minister take on board that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
        <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and thank the Minister and his staff for their hard work on it.  This Bill introduces many measures to address the personal insolvency issue in this country.  The Government is aware of the difficulties which many people are facing.  This legislation, the introduction of which has been a priority for the Government, will replace the outdated current legislation.  </P>
        <P>Many people and homeowners have been badly affected by the collapse in the property market, leaving them with huge debts, in negative equity and struggling to meet mortgage repayments.  It is important that borrowers are given the assistance and support they need to allow them restructure their repayments.  They must be assisted in agreeing more realistic payment terms with their banks.  It is vital also that the banks are flexible towards borrowers, taking into account the current financial climate and restructuring loans taking into account the person&rsquo;s ability to repay.  It is in the interests of the bank and the debtor to establish a realistic payment arrangement to resolve debt issues.</P>
        <P>It has been clear for a long time that Ireland&rsquo;s personal insolvency legislation needed to be updated to effectively address the mortgage arrears problem.  At the end of March this year, there were 764,138 private residential mortgage accounts in respect of principal dwellings in Ireland valued at &euro;112 billion, with 42,000 mortgage holders more than 12 months behind on repayments.  It is imperative that measures are introduced to resolve this crisis.  It is important to note that the majority of borrowers continue to meet their mortgage obligations but that help is clearly needed for those who are in distress.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a number of non-judicial debt settlement processes to deal with the crisis, including a debt relief notice, which will allow for the write-off of qualifying debt of up to &euro;20,000, including credit card debt.  This will be subject to a three year supervision period, with the debt being frozen for a year before being written off.  Like previous speakers, I welcome the involvement of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, in relation to debt relief notices.  A debt settlement arrangement whereby the debtor agrees to a multi-year arrangement to pay off an amount of his or her loan and a personal insolvency arrangement in relation to the agreed settlement of secured debt of up to &euro;3 million and unsecured debt over six years are also being introduced.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, the insolvency service of Ireland will be established.  This body will liaise with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners to investigate applications and to determine whether people are eligible for debt relief notices and will provide information to the Government and public regarding legislation in this area.  I welcome that this Bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1988 to bring Ireland&rsquo;s insolvency laws into line with those of most other EU countries by way of reducing from 12 to three years the automatic discharge from bankruptcy period, which is more realistic.</P>
        <P>Debtors are encouraged to make contact with their banks and to engage in negotiations with them in respect of a repayment plan.  Likewise, banks should actively engage with customers experiencing difficulties to discuss the various options open to them.  This Bill offers new and more flexible choices to people in debt, providing options to those who are genuinely unable to make repayments.  Like other Members, I, too, have been told by my constituents of the difficulties they are experiencing and of their fears of losing their homes.  It is crucial that the banks engage in negotiations with customers and try to reach mutually agreeable arrangements with those struggling on a financial basis.</P>
        <P>The Government wishes to assist people in getting their lives back on track and to ensure credit is available from the banks on a more consistent basis.  As regards, the personal insolvency trustees, it is important the Government appoints appropriate people to this role as they are the people who will provide the mediation in terms of resolving people&rsquo;s debt issues.  As I stated, currently 42,000 mortgage holders are more than 12 months behind in their mortgage repayments.  The personal insolvency process needs to be sufficiently unattractive to banks to persuade them to resolve the bulk of these arrears cases before they reach that process.  One wonders if the mortgage arrears solutions proposed by the banks in the newspapers are sufficient to deal with the current crisis and avoid 42,000 families becoming insolvent.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the role of the personal insolvency trustee is independent of Government, the banks and debtors.  It must be seen to be independent, transparent, practical and wholly honest in its dealings.  Consumer confidence must be restored.  While blanket debt forgiveness is not required, the 100,000 to 200,000 people experiencing debt problems will require long-term agreements to be put in place if they are to meet these debts, thus enabling them to once again plan their lives and become valued productive citizens.  The current provision of six-month roll-overs may be insufficient.  Every effort will be made to allow people to stay in their homes unless they do not want to do so or the cost of staying in their property is too significant.  In recognising the financial difficulties many homeowners have been experiencing, the Government has introduced a number of initiatives to help them, including the mortgage interest relief scheme and the mortgage interest supplement.  Some 18,000 people are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement which provides short-term income support to those who are eligible to assist them with their mortgage interest repayments.  The Government has set aside &euro;61 million this year for that scheme.</P>
        <P>The Government has recently announced the mortgage to rent scheme which will further address the issue.  This will provide help to families whose mortgage situation is untenable, enabling them to stay in their homes and pay rent while the ownership of their properties is transferred to an approved housing body.  This scheme is expected to prevent 3,500 families from losing their homes.</P>
        <P>Some of the critics have argued that the Bill is too favourable towards the banks as mortgage holders are advised to discuss their cases with their banks and negotiate a solution.  I have some concerns that if banks fail to engage fully it will leave the debtor in a very precarious position.  It is obviously important to monitor the banks in this regard and that the debtors have someone with whom they can raise their cases if they feel the bank is refusing to engage in fair negotiations with them.  It is vital that the banks are made to comply with the Bill&rsquo;s guidelines.</P>
        <P>I obviously welcome what the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, told the House on Thursday, 5 July when he highlighted that financial institutions will need to step up and provide their customers with a wider range of financial debt resolution options than is currently on offer.  I am also encouraged by the recent statement by the president of the Irish Banking Federation, John Reynolds, in which he stated that all banks have a shared purpose and common ground with Government in seeking to ensure that the greatest possible number of borrowers, who are currently experiencing difficulties with their mortgage repayments, have them restructured and restored to sustainability.  Some 200,000 homeowners have some form of debt problem and need long-term agreements to allow them to restructure their debts and regain consumer confidence.</P>
        <P>The personal insolvency terms in the Bill are better than, for example, the introduction of an individual voluntary agreement, which many believe would encourage people to live a lifestyle of excess in the knowledge that they could have it all written off through such an arrangement.  There has been widespread support for the Bill.  The chief executive of AIB, David Duffy, has said he supports the legislation and will ensure his bank meets all its requirements.  The Independent Mortgage Advisers Federation has welcomed the Bill, as has Chartered Accountants Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government is very aware of the problems many homeowners are experiencing.  It is a priority of Government to help these people and the introduction of the Bill is a welcome step in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is very detailed and complex legislation.  We need to ensure the citizens of the State get a fair hearing, decent legislation, real reform and support for families in crisis as a result of the debt issue.  That is what the debate on this legislation needs to be about.  It is not a time for sitting on the fence but a time for real legislation that will support people in their hour of need.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which held hearings in advance of the publication of the legislation.  The heads of the Bill were referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on 26 January 2012 by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The committee was invited to consider the heads and to respond to the Minister by 1 March.  During the debate we received ten written submissions and we also held a public hearing on 5 February.  I thank the committee&rsquo;s Chairman, Deputy Stanton, for the magnificent work he and the team did on this legislation.  I also thank those who made submissions and appeared before the committee.</P>
        <P>We all accept we need to deal with the broader issue of debt.  I am interested in the more than 200,000 homeowners; I am not interested greedy people, bankers, developers and others who lost the run of themselves when it came to borrowing during the Celtic tiger.  I come from the old-fashioned school that believes that those who borrow something should pay it back or do their best to pay it back and I am sure the majority of people would agree.  They are the interests I represent in today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>All those who participated in the hearings would acknowledge that our bankruptcy legislation is outdated and any attempt to address the issue is welcome.  The committee recognised that the Bill was one part of a package of measures aimed at tackling the problem of indebtedness, including the recommendations of the recent Keane and Cooney reports.  Another issue that came up during the committee&rsquo;s discussions is the human element of this.  The committee acknowledged that this is an extremely complex and difficult matter to address in legislation.  Irresponsible lending and borrowing have largely contributed to this problem.  All members of the all-party committee felt that attributing blame will not address the problem.  Behind all the facts and figures are real people who are devastated at the real prospect of losing their homes.  That goes to the heart of the legislation.</P>
        <P>While I am not a defender in any way of the banks, there is another issue going on behind closed doors that is not trendy to discuss.  When people come to my clinics I advise them to try to do a deal to restructure and I often write a letter for them to a bank or building society manager.  The majority of them do not seem to need to come back to my clinic.  In other words, I get the impression that many side deals are quietly done behind the scenes.  People are restructuring their mortgages and deals are being done.  I do not know why it never seems to get mentioned in this House and it is not mentioned in the media.  I believe that 90% of people, who come to backbench Deputies with problems with banks and building societies relating to mortgages, end up doing some sort of a deal even if it is only paying back &euro;30 or &euro;40 a week.  It is common sense to get &euro;50 a week from a family rather than putting them out on the street and trying to sell the house when the market is depressed.  I raise this issue because a number of my colleagues seem to be saying the opposite.  While I am open to persuasion, that is my experience as a backbench Deputy.</P>
        <P>I have to laugh at some of my colleagues in the Labour Party who regularly do their rant about the bank guarantee and have a go at those of us who were around at that fateful time in 2008.  I have heard them defending the credit unions - the workers&rsquo; banks they call them.  I remind my friends and colleagues in the Labour Party that one of the biggest lobbyists during the bank guarantee debate in the D&aacute;il at that time was the credit unions.  I clearly remember that the credit unions were on our case to ensure their depositors were protected.  It was a very complex issue at the time in 2008.  People were very worried that Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien in Donnycarney, who had &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 in her little bank account for a rainy day, might lose all her money.  People were phoning into Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme and marching on banks.  People should have a little more balance when they pontificate after the event.  Of course when we all discovered what went on in the banks, I personally voted against much of the legislation at the time.  However, during those few days many things were going on in the country and the high moral ground brigade in the Labour Party would want to wise up to that.  They just happened to be lucky to call a decision that appeared to be right in the long term.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>At the time many people were frightened, many people&rsquo;s businesses were going down the tubes and they had to make a decision.  The core issue was that the guarantee was too broad and we all accept that but at the time those bankers lied to their gills to most politicians.  I remember banging on the doors of Deputies&rsquo; offices and asking them what was the story on the guarantee and most of them did not know.  They were being fed misinformation by these senior bankers.  In terms of history, it is important that be recorded.</P>
        <P>The family home should be protected in any insolvency arrangement and in making insolvency arrangements, the family home should be handled separately from other properties such as investment properties or holiday homes.  That is an important message to get across.  We have to prioritise the family home.  If one takes a hit on investment properties or holiday homes, that is a different debate, as against protecting the roof over one&rsquo;s head.  It was submitted to the committee that considered this measure that currently when a judge hears a repossession case, where the borrower is in default, the judge has no discretion in regard to the granting of an order of repossession in favour of the lender.  The submission proposed that judges, in very specific circumstances, have discretion to refuse repossession in order to encourage reasonable and fair behaviour on the part of the lenders.  We asked the Minister to examine the possibility of ensuring that such provision is included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to dealing with the debt issue, there was an overall view that if someone gets into financial difficulty they should initially engage in discussions with their creditors with a view to making a manageable arrangement based on his or her individual circumstances.  This is a common sense approach and one I would welcome.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of Bill, many people have major concerns about it, which I would share.  My colleague, Deputy Shane Ross, has called it a bankers&rsquo; charter; I will examine his views on this and, if it transpires that is the case, l will take that on board and examine it.  People are concerned, they are wary of the bank veto and the debtor supports.</P>
        <P>I am strongly interested in the position taken by FLAC with regard to the legislation.  It has concerns that the new Bill must prove its effectiveness in the face of huge and urgent societal problems of people being unable to deal with their debts.  That means the State must offer a suite of effective solutions that people can understand, negotiate themselves, or with proper supports to guide them where appropriate.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the Bill, as providing a structure for people to start dealing with the unsustainable debts in a structured manner but there are concerns about it.  While the Bill is for those who are unable to pay their debts in full, it will also help people who need a bargaining chip with their creditors.  This is the positive side of the legislation.  I have concerns about the imbalance of power between the banks and debtors, as the Bill preserves the creditors&rsquo; veto in respect of the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement options.  These are issues I would like discussed and dealt with by way of amendments.</P>
        <P>The proposed law as it stands still does not impose a legally binding obligation on lenders to accept reasonable applications from customers in arrears; neither does the Bill provide for a right of debtor&rsquo;s appeal to a creditor&rsquo;s decision in any of its options.  These are matters that can tweaked at a later Stage and dealt with by way of amendment.</P>
        <P>I remain concerned about four elements of the Government&rsquo;s action on the mortgage debt plan, namely, the new legislation, bank co-operation, debtor information and support, and social housing, which must have monitors and checks built in to ensure that the plan is working for debtors.  The Bill has improved the provision for reviewing the effectiveness of the personal insolvency arrangement option, down to five years from ten years proposed in January.  However, I would argue that this is still too long.  Reviews should be annual and should be applied across all options.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for some measures of family home protection.  A personal insolvency practitioner proposing either a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement must try to ensure that a debtor can maintain the family home unless the mortgage is unsustainable or unsuitable.  These are important issues I would like to raise with the Minister in regard to these measures.</P>
        <P>The four options I would like to raise comprise three tiers of out of court settlements and a final bankruptcy option through the High Court.  The first is the debt relief notice for write-off of qualifying debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period. The second is the debt settlement arrangement for agreed settlement of unsecured debt over five years.  The third is the personal insolvency arrangement for agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million - this cap can be waived with the consent of all secured creditors - and unsecured debt, over six years.  The fourth is bankruptcy legislation to provide for automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years, except in cases of non-co-operation or fraud, on which the court officials would adjudicate.</P>
        <P>A new insolvency service will certify or determine applications for the debt relief notice and will certify applications for the debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement, and these will be ratified by the Circuit Court or High Court.  The personal insolvency practitioners will make proposals on behalf of debtors in the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement and must act impartially.  These are the issues involved and we must ensure they are dealt with.  I stress that the key issue is to ensure that the 200,000 people who are in genuine need must be protected.  Within that figure there are those who will not pay and those who cannot pay.  I do not want to see people trying to pull smart one on the State or on the taxpayers of this country and people who have the resources not making an effort to pay their debt.</P>
        <P>I have other observations I would make on the Bill.  The creditor threshold on debtor proposals under the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement is 65%, which constitutes a veto.  However, it may be less attractive for creditors to reject out-of-court proposals, as the alternative may be a three-year bankruptcy where the creditor may receive less money.  In bankruptcy, an income payments order may be made at any time during the bankruptcy and the order can last up to five years.  Fees and costs may be high for the debt settlement arrangement and particularly the personal insolvency arrangement options, as in the latter the insolvency practitioner will have to monitor the arrangement for some time.  Interestingly, a personal insolvency practitioner will have to be able to vouch that the debtor has been unable to come to a voluntary arrangement with creditors before being able to apply for reliefs under the Bill.  This gives an indication of how money advice structures and-or loan modification arrangements will fit in with the new options, in that debtors must first seek to settle debts outside the remit of the new legislative options.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that the Bill requires six months of co-operation with the mortgage lender under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or a similar Central Bank approved process, before applying for a personal insolvency arrangement.  Yet the recent changes to mortgage interest supplement mean that a person must currently prove 12 months of making agreed alternative payment arrangements under the code of conduct before he or she can even apply for the supplement.  A new provision here is that while secured debt is not part of a debt settlement arrangement, in practice, the insolvency practitioner must try to ensure in the arrangement that the debtor can maintain the family home, unless it is an unsustainable or unsuitable mortgage.</P>
        <P>The provision for review of the personal insolvency arrangement after five years is still too long.  It is worth noting that the &euro;3 million cap on secured debts under the personal insolvency arrangement can be waived with agreement from all creditors which may be useful for creditors looking for an out-of-court solution to higher debts.  Also, a person looking for relief under any of the three options set out in the Bill must be resident in Ireland now or have been living or having a business here for some part of the previous year.  This will be welcome news for people who have emigrated recently and who have debts at home.  While a minimum protected income is referred to in the Bill there are no regulations as yet to provide the detail.  For bankruptcy, the applicant&rsquo;s debts must exceed his or her assets by at least &euro;20,000.  These are important points in regard to this legislation.</P>
        <P>This is complex legislation and many people are concerned about it because the debt management systems proposed to be established are also convoluted and complex.  A citizen will need a heavyweight of professional expertise to understand or access them.  Therefore, at this stage people are relying on the spin of politicians or people involved in the financial services industry.</P>
        <P>While the banks still retain a veto it is a meaningless and toothless effort if no action is taken on this issue.  I refer to other guidelines such as split mortgages and the selling and renting back of a home but in these cases the mortgage holders will still owe the bank.  These issues can be dealt with by the tabling of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>A significant concern is the question of the minimum protected income which any debtor applicant should be permitted to retain free from debt distribution.  The committee hearings were told that it is not clear in the Bill what would be a reasonable standard of living and this uncertainty could affect the effectiveness of the Bill.  It was also suggested that a certain level of savings should be allowed to debtors to deal with emergencies.  I am conscious that there may be individuals who will attempt to pull stunts or smart ones but I agree that debtors should be allowed retain a certain level of savings.  The committee was told that in contrast to interest-only payments which leave debts standing still, every payment should cover the capital, the current interests, the arrears and any interest on arrears, mortgage protection insurance and buildings insurance.  This would ensure that every debtor would gain something from all payments.  Interest-only payments serve only to sustain the profits of the financial institution in question without helping the position of the debtor.  It would seem that debtors and their families will be asked to consign their income to the creditors for five to seven years.  These issues were raised at the committee hearings and they could form the basis for amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The provision of a clawback in the event of an uplift following a successful personal insolvency arrangement was a point raised at the committee hearings so that if the value of the property increased in the future the debtor would be required to repay some of this value to the secured creditor.  Another possible consideration is that after a period of five years the clawback would abate incrementally by 5% over a period of 20 years.  The committee stressed that the clawback should not act as a disincentive to persons seeking career advancement and that an appeals body would be involved in the decision.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the reform of personal insolvency law and will introduce debt relief, debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements for secured debt up to &euro;3 million.  It will provide help to those in mortgage debt and it is part of the overall economic package.  As well as dealing with the debt issue we must also deal with the issue of the national finances and economic growth.  The balance must be correctly struck between dealing with debt and reduction in expenditure and encouraging economic growth.</P>
        <P>Those who six months ago disagreed with the policies advocated by the Independent Deputies are now coming around to the reality.  We were one of the first groups in the House to hammer home the point that the debt issue must be dealt in tandem with the issue of economic growth.  Many Members had a go at us for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum but we put debt and growth on the agenda and the French followed our example.  The Minister should take note that we strengthened his hand when he went to Europe.  It was a team effort and we delivered.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
        <P>I am delighted to hear that Deputy McGrath has such a great influence on European macro-economic policy.  It is acknowledged that the subject matter of this Bill is complicated.  I thank the members of the committee who conducted the hearings and I acknowledge the contributions to the hearings by representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations and individuals.  It was decided this morning that the committee may revisit the Bill before Committee Stage because the work of the committee and the views of others have been taken into account in the Bill as published.  The heads of the Bill have been changed as a result and it may be necessary for the committee to seek further views if time permits before the commencement of Committee Stage.  I acknowledge the work of the Ministers and the officials in the preparation of this legislation.  The Bill contains many provisions which are of interest or which may need to be tweaked, so to speak.</P>
        <P>The issue of debt and bankruptcy is not new.  In ancient Greece the issue did not exist as such but a debtor was forced into debt slavery in order to work off the debt.  A period of five years was the usual period but it could often extend to a lifetime.  Genghis Khan ruled that anyone falling into debt three times would face the death penalty but even he allowed individuals to work off a debt.  The Old Testament allowed for a sabbatical year every seven years in which all debts were automatically released.  Islamic law recognises that insolvent persons must be allowed time to pay off or work through a debt or to come to some other arrangement.  In later times debtors were committed to debtors prison.  My point is that the issue of debt is not new and it has been dealt with in many ways over the millennia.  We are facing it in our own way in these times and we are attempting to deal with it in the modern age.</P>
        <P>I refer to the need for an appeals process and this was raised at the committee hearings.  There are constitutional issues to do with property rights and these are complex.  The Credit Review Office performs a very useful function.  It has no regulatory or mandatory powers but its opinion is noted.  I ask the Minister to consider a similar agency or even that agency performing an oversight function or providing an appeals mechanism for complainants.</P>
        <P>An intermediary function is provided for in the Bill and intermediaries will need to be strictly regulated.  The banks will need to have protocols in place which are consistently applied by all the banks otherwise banks could have different procedures and reactions to debtors and to the insolvency arrangements.  How will the creditors evaluate proposals from the insolvency practitioners?  A consistent approach will be needed.  The personal insolvency practitioners need to be aware of the criteria being applied by the banks.  There needs to be a transparent flow of information back and forth from all concerned.  All debtors must be treated equally.  If debtors are in a similar situation and one goes to one bank and is treated in a certain way and the other goes to another bank and is treated in a different way, that is wrong and unfair.  Work must done to ensure all the banks operate in an equal and transparent way.  Less transparency will lead to more cost, time and so forth.</P>
        <P>The approach in this legislation is extremely complicated.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has said that nobody has all the wisdom in this regard and that he is open to suggestions and ideas.  That has been evident to date and it is extremely welcome.  However, it is important that the implementation of this legislation be monitored and reported from the first day.  Five years is too long.  How that can be done is another matter, but it must be done because if there are issues, mistakes and problems with the legislation, they must be identified and dealt with early.</P>
        <P>We must remember that most of the people who will use this framework are already under severe stress.  Many Deputies have had people calling to their constituency offices who are under severe stress, emotionally upset, physically drained and losing sleep trying to deal with this problem.  Many Members have said this is complicated legislation so we must ensure we make it as easy as possible for people to work with it.  It also must be clear how it will work.  There is a job for the Government and the agency to be established under the Bill to provide information and to ensure it is simple to understand.  At present, however, it is very complex, and the more one digs into the legislation the more complex it seems to get.  Work must be done to inform people how the legislation will work.  The money advice and budgeting service has been mentioned and I welcome that it will be involved.  However, it must be stressed that MABS needs resourcing and training to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>There is a limit for the debt relief notice, DRN, of &euro;20,000.  That is too low.  It should be raised to &euro;30,000.  I am not sure of the implications of that, but the figure of &euro;20,000 is too low.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, made a submission on the legislation recently in which it stated that only 15% of clients of MABS, in its estimation, will qualify for a DRN, principally because of the maximum limit of &euro;20,000 of qualifying debts before this option would be available.  Work will have to be done on that, and we also need to see figures on it.  FLAC suggests increasing the figure to &euro;30,000 which would expand significantly the number to whom this might apply.  It also suggests other options.</P>
        <P>The veto has been mentioned by many contributors to the debate.  I understand what is happening in that regard but if the Credit Review Office is involved and another stakeholder is monitoring it, even though that might serve to complicate it, it has been shown to work well elsewhere.  Obviously it is important that all voluntary arrangements be tried first.  Some people have proposed that a voluntary arrangement would be a fifth tier; there are four tiers provided for in the legislation.  Minimum income must be protected.  The banks and credit institutions will, understandably, try to get what they can from this arrangement.  However, the minimum income must be protected.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has put forward a proposal on how to calculate a minimum income.  That calculation must be clear and everybody must know how it is to be done.</P>
        <P>The intermediaries must be trusted by both the banks and the debtors.  That means serious regulation.  It also means that bankruptcy as a concept should be spoken about.  At present, there is a stigma attached to bankruptcy in Ireland, and many people do not want to go that route due to that stigma.  If that stigma were removed in some way or made less undesirable, it could mean that people would be less fearful of it.  It has been said that credit institutions quite often refuse what might be seen to be a reasonable offer, but if the option is bankruptcy and people were prepared to take that route, the institutions might think again about it.  That is the thrust of the Minister&rsquo;s thinking but there is a concern that people might not opt for bankruptcy and instead take an offer that might be quite severe for them, just to avoid bankruptcy and the stigma attached to it.  There is work to be done to get that right as well.  The other issue is that people often seek help very late in the day.  MABS tell us that constantly.  Again, it is because of the stigma, embarrassment and so forth.  We must encourage people to seek help as early as possible.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, we must evaluate this process as we proceed.  Not only must we know how it is working but we also need to know the socio-demographic characteristics of those using the legislation.  We need to know who is using this and many other statistics in this area because, at present, we do not really know what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Minister might also reflect on the issue of the insolvency trustees.  How are they to be paid, who will pay them and how much will they be paid?  There is a risk of establishing an army of people who will be involved in this.  They need to be regulated and controlled, and we must consider how that will be done.</P>
        <P>There are some people who have decided their mortgages are untenable, and I realise this involves more than just mortgages, and they have decided to hand over their houses to the banks.  That leaves them with a debt.  I call on the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, in particular, to ensure the local authorities respond quickly to this.  I have encountered a number of cases where people have given up their houses but even though the Government has decided they can go on the housing list, it is not happening in some cases.  There is huge resistance to it.  Instead of the local authorities and the housing officers asking how they can help these people, they are hunting them away in some instances.  There must be clarity about this.  If people give up their houses because they are no longer able to maintain the mortgage payments, they must be taken on by the local authorities.  The local authority should at least allow them to be put on the housing list because they would then qualify for the rent supplement.  Otherwise, such people will be homeless.  A number of us have come across such situations.  Those people must also deal with the now unsecured debt, which is the overhand of the mortgage.</P>
        <P>Moral hazard has been mentioned, but write-downs occur in the commercial sector all the time.  It works quite well there.  With regard to the debt settlement arrangement, DSA, a State-funded public insolvency area must be created here.  Perhaps some MABS advisers could be seconded to it.  In Norway and France the creditors can appeal to courts; there is an appeal system in both places.  This area is complex and people must overcome many hurdles.  Initially people who are already under stress must locate a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, who will go through their affairs and prepare statements.  They must show that they are insolvent.  The PIP must apply to the insolvency service and there are reviews involved, but no timelines for them.  The creditors can appeal the granting of a certificate to a court if they wish.  If the certificate is applied for, the PIP must notify the creditors.  Values must be estimated and, at that stage, a meeting of the creditors is called.  There is a great deal of bureaucracy and procedures involved, which could deter people.  We must streamline that and, initially, make it very clear.  As I stated, there is a danger that if people fear bankruptcy, they might agree to an unworkable payment process.  We must bear this in mind.</P>
        <P>I would like the Bill to do more for those who recognise they have unsustainable mortgages and who agree with their banks that they should give up their homes.  While the arrangement is that they can pay as much as they want for up to five years, they can do that now anyway.  Alternatively, they could go to England for a year and return almost completely debt free.  Many people in this position who have no business or debt arising from investment properties lost their incomes due to the downturn and have engaged fully with their banks to try to work their way out of debt.  Their homes are in serious negative equity and they have totally unsustainable mortgages.  The Bill should specifically recognise circumstances where debt is associated primarily with the family home and the individual concerned wants to remain in the home.  This is covered in the Bill but more needs to be done.</P>
        <P>The legislation is complicated and there is a lot of work to be done on it yet.  I am worried that people may be deterred by its complication.  We need to be very clear so people can use the service proposed.  The personal insolvency trustees will need to be subject to strong regulation.  While I know an appeal system will not work, a review system should be contemplated.  Perhaps the Credit Review Office, which is working quite well in other areas, should be considered in this regard.</P>
        <P>There ought to be protocols in the financial institutions so it will be very clear how they are working and so there will be clarity and transparency in both directions.  With such protocols, people will be treated consistently and fairly.  The insolvency practitioners should know how the system works so they will know what people are getting into.  These measures should be reviewed from day one.  Since the proposals are so new and complex, a wait of five years is far too long.</P>
        <P>We await Committee Stage with keen anticipation.  It will be challenging.  Before the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, joined us, I stated that the committee may, if there is time, invite further submissions on the Bill, which has changed considerably since the heads were introduced and since we first examined it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill but, as Deputy Stanton said, it requires major amendment.  It represents a very complex and bureaucratic approach to everyday lives.  We must first recognise the impact of omitting the bankruptcy option, which pertains to the big and the few.  Most ordinary people in debt want simple solutions that are not overly bureaucratic.  They want to get on with their lives.</P>
        <P>The Government has not been very proactive on the debt issue.  This response seems very much controlled by the banks.  The reality is that debt worries are affecting many people.  Debt is probably the main issue holding back recovery.  More important, it is causing untold misery and hardship.  We must ask ourselves how many people who have committed suicide in the past four years did so because of debt worries.</P>
        <P>The second point we should consider when examining people&rsquo;s response to debt is that if individuals, particularly those at whom this Bill is aimed, really understood all the rules well, they would not really worry as much as those who did not seek any advice.  One would realise that in existing law, there are a large number of remedies, particularly in respect of small debt.  Therefore, we need to reach out to these people and remove the shame associated with their debt.  We need to tell people that indebtedness can be experienced by anybody.</P>
        <P>At a time in which we have done great work on reducing the number of road deaths, we must ask how many suicides have been caused in recent years because of debt worries.  How many relationships and marriages have broken up because of debt?  For human, social and economic reasons, we need to address this.</P>
        <P>Time and again we rightly say that people with addiction and illness problems should move on from guilt complexes.  I agree with that very strongly.  I am worried that we are adding to the guilt complexes over debt with all the talk of moral hazard.  When I hear banks talk about moral hazard and express worry about moral hazard associated with a write-off, I think of two phenomena, the first of which is that all of us can make mistakes and the second of which is that most people who make mistakes learn from them and do not repeat them.  To hear banks talking of moral hazard is a joke given that they were the biggest serial gamblers of all time.  They gambled the equivalent of trillions of euro worldwide.  The problem was not confined to Ireland alone.  Across the world, the banks have ruined the lives of many people and have caused much misery.  Therefore, I do not buy into the moral hazard argument.  It is totally spurious and it makes it harder for people with debts to seek advice and relief.</P>
        <P>Begrudgery and arguments associated with moral superiority are causing considerable damage.  One hears people asking why they should bail out certain individuals.  They should do so because they are fortunate enough to be able to pay their taxes.  If somebody in one&rsquo;s community is down, is it not right to give him a helping hand on the basis that if one ever needed a helping hand, that individual would give it?</P>
        <P>If we were to take the argument of moral hazard to its logical extreme, no smoker, alcoholic, individual involved in a car accident, motorist who was not wearing a seat belt or motorist who was driving a little too fast would be admitted to hospital at the public expense.  The argument would be that the individuals should not have done what they did, and that we are only encouraging them to smoke, drive too fast, not wear a seat belt or drink too much by admitting them to hospital.  Therefore, when one considers the moral hazard argument in everyday terms, one realises it is crazy.</P>
        <P>Let us identify the reasons people are in debt and address the problem in the interest of the common good and in a spirit of community and sharing.  My experience of people in debt points to those who, through no fault of their own, are utterly foolish with money and can never seem to keep it in their pockets.  They borrow ill-advisedly.  I have met people with gambling and alcohol addictions who never have money and who are always in debt.  Such people will always be in society.  We must help them not to hurt themselves and those around them.  I will always help them because the trademark of a decent society is helping those in trouble.  I realise, however, that giving more money in any form to people in this group is like putting water into a bucket with a hole in it; on doing so, one is no better off.  There are other ways to deal with them.  They were with us in the good times and will be with us forever.  They need our help and we need to find ways to provide it.</P>
        <P>The majority of people in financial difficulties either borrowed beyond their means when they could get easy credit from banks - the banks were giving it out over the telephone but are unlikely to repeat the exercise, having been badly scorched - or did not borrow overly much and based it on the expectation of future income.  This latter group could include people in the building trade who had partners in the public service, both of whom had good incomes and borrowed reasonably.  One could not claim that, had their incomes been maintained, they had borrowed beyond their means.  Other people are a mixture of these two groups.</P>
        <P>The moral hazard argument does not stand up.  If people tried to repeat the exercise, the banks would be unlikely to lend to them again.  We need not worry about the moral hazard of fixing people&rsquo;s problems.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a general money issue as opposed to an issue relating to the Bill.  We must consider the macro level construction of money and the banking collapse in Spain and Germany, from where most of the money was loaned, as well as the rest of the world.  When we put our money into banks, do we want them to gamble with it, our pension funds, our life assurance policies, our insurance funds and so on?  Just as there were ethical investments, have we reached the point at which people making investments or buying into pension funds should take smaller returns if they can be assured their money will not be gambled on the market?  The world economy would not be at the whim of the so-called markets, which have got matters wrong before and will do so again.  Given the chaos caused by the markets&rsquo; movement of money from here to there and their multi-trillion euro bets on what would happen, people would not want to be complicit.  The world must consider these fundamental issues.  Contrary to popular opinion, the bulk of the money in question does not belong to the rich.  Instead, it is ordinary wealth that is aggregated and played on the super gambling markets, which have brought us so much misery.</P>
        <P>Despite the Cooney and Keane reports, little has happened.  How should the problems the Bill sets out to tackle be approached?  The Bill&rsquo;s proposals are worthy, particularly given the fact that we must modernise our legislation.  If I have enough time, I will address some of its details.  However, other non-bureaucratic solutions could give people considerable relief.  For example, we could reduce interest rates.  The European Central Bank, ECB, keeps reducing rates - the 0.75% is predicted to reach 0.5% - so that the consumer, the person with the debt, is under less pressure.  It also works perfectly for the person with the tracker mortgage.  It is the greatest relief possible.  Due to Basel III and prudential capital assessment reviews, PCARs, however, deposit interest rates have no relationship with the ECB&rsquo;s rate.  This situation came about when the regulator decided to get the deposit to lending ratio into a good gear quickly.  Since there is only a certain amount of money to deposit, we have created a bubble in deposit interest rates.  It places the banks under financial pressure, which is passed on to the customer in the form of variable rates, sub-prime mortgage rates, credit card rates and so on.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to spell out the difference made by interest rates, the simplest instruments of all.  If one has a mortgage of &euro;200,000 at 7%, interest will cost &euro;269 per week.  If one reduces the rate to 5%, interest decreases to &euro;192.  If the rate is reduced to 2.75%, similar to a tracker mortgage&rsquo;s 2% above the ECB&rsquo;s rate, interest decreases to &euro;105.  This is extraordinary.  If the ECB&rsquo;s rate reduces to 0.5%, the person&rsquo;s interest will decrease to &euro;96.  For many people, the difference between &euro;269 and &euro;96 is the ability to pay.  It is often the difference between being able to pay with a little bit of comfort and not being able to pay at all.  Therefore, Europe should reduce deposit interest rates first so that banks can lend to people.  Otherwise, reducing the ECB&rsquo;s rate will be pointless.  The Government should consider applying pressure or introducing legislation to ensure maximum interest rates.  We need to reduce interest rates.  This is the simplest solution and is unbureaucratic.  Armies of personal insolvency plans, PIPs, would not be needed.</P>
        <P>I have always favoured a second solution.  Be it through the mortgage interest supplement or an amendment to the family income supplement, FIS, to take mortgage repayments into account, a direct payment should be made to a person over a short period while he or she is, for example, unemployed.  Some people were reasonably prudent but ran into problems because their incomes collapsed, for example, a blocklayer who earned &euro;1,000 per week, is now earning nothing and whose spouse is working.  The simplest solution is to lift such people over the sty.  When they return to employment and the economy picks up, the supplement is withdrawn.  From where would the money come?  Regardless of how we approach the situation, we will pay.  Under my solution, people would repay their mortgages and the banks would not need as much money to absorb their write-offs.  We own the majority of the banks.  If the mortgages they provided are not repaid, we will pay.</P>
        <P>The Bill is dominated by the banks&rsquo; thinking.  The first two solutions, those in respect of less than &euro;20,000 and up to &euro;65,000, should be reduced to one.  An ordinary person with a debt of less than &euro;20,000 would need to be in awful trouble to go through this unnecessarily complicated process.  If one owed &euro;20,000, I am not sure as to whether one would be better off going to the local District Court instead, admitting to the debt, handing over an examination of means and accepting the judge&rsquo;s decision of a repayment of &euro;10 per week.  That might be preferable to the procedure employed here.  It should be remembered that many of the people with these small debts have no experience in dealing with these very complicated procedures.</P>
        <P>There are other issues.  If a person gets &euro;500 or his or car is worth more than &euro;1,200, it has an effect on the process, and that is below the belt.  A person may have bought a car worth &euro;4,000 and be three quarters of the way through paying for it with a hire purchase scheme.  This is a penal element.  The worst part is that having done the deal and agreed the write-off of a debt of less than &euro;20,000, if a person manages to get a job, the deal would be reviewed.</P>
        <P>There was a big debate here about the leaked ESRI report about disincentives to work and the poverty traps.  In the real world, people do not want to pay what is effectively 75% tax on work.  In many cases when people get jobs, between the universal social charge, PRSI, PAYE and all the rest, it is easy to have the tax rate at 35%, 40% or 50%.  People would then be told that agreed repayments would be adjusted, and when all of this comes together, what is to be left in one&rsquo;s pocket as a reward for hard work and getting a job?  It would be much more tempting to do a little bit on the black market so as not only to avoid all the tax and PRSI but also the possibility of the loan repayments being adjusted.</P>
        <P>When debt is written off, it should be done conclusively.  We should allow people a new start like we do for people who have gone bankrupt.  Those people can have millions of euro written off and when they start making millions of euro again, the bankruptcy is not adjusted, at least in my understanding of it.  If it is good for the rich it is good for the poor.  Those who will go bankrupt would have been wealthy and got into a deep hole.  I beg the Minister to think about this again.</P>
        <P>I know there will be logical but boring and unrealistic arguments, and it may be shocking to write debt off if the possibility remains that a person would get a job.  Imagine how horrendous it would be if a person could get a job and rebuild his or life.  We are speaking about debts of under &euro;20,000, mainly to credit institutions which acted in a totally reckless manner in many cases in loaning this money.  They contacted people, asking them to take more money, and they increased credit card limits without being asked.</P>
        <P>The Minister should take that element from the Bill and make it clean and simple.  A deal is done on a person&rsquo;s current circumstances.  There are many rules concerned with how long people should have debt before this process would come into effect.  I do not believe, because of its complexity, that people will charge in through the door to avail of this process to get rid of debts of under &euro;20,000 or &euro;65,000.  I have a simple request for the Minister, that he reconsider the process of writing off debt.  What is done is done and the debt should be written off conclusively.  If a person is lucky enough to regain employment or receive an inheritance, he or she will pay tax on that.  Otherwise, such people should be able to rebuild their lives and produce again in our economy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
        <P>I very much welcome this Bill, which is one of the most significant Bills that has come before the 31st Dail.  The Bill provides for comprehensive reform of insolvency law and practice.  It provides for new, more flexible options to address the circumstances of insolvent debtors and it addresses the obligations of debtors and the rights of creditors in a proportionate and balanced way, taking into account the financial reality of individual circumstances.</P>
        <P>The development of modern insolvency law is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  It was also required by the terms of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  The reform also takes into account recommendations made in the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears report of October 2011, the Keane report.  That report states: &ldquo;The early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial bankruptcy options is vital.  Without effective bankruptcy legislation the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.&rdquo;  The general scheme of the Bill was published for consultation by the Government on 25 January.  Several important submissions, in particular the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, were taken into account in the finalisation of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the Bill provides for the reform of personal insolvency law and will introduce three new non-judicial debt resolution processes.  The first of these is the debt relief notice which will allow for the write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three-year supervision period.  The Bill also provides for a debt settlement arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt over five years, and the personal insolvency arrangement will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million - although this cap can be increased with the consent of all secured creditors - and unsecured debt over six years.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision for enhanced oversight of the three new debt resolution procedures by the Circuit Court or the High Court where the debts concerned are in excess of &euro;2.5 million.  The Circuit Court will receive the debtor&rsquo;s case file from the insolvency service with an application for a debt relief notice or a protective certificate in respect of a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.</P>
        <P>The court&rsquo;s consideration or hearing will take place on an <i>ex parte</i> basis and neither debtor nor creditor will be required to be present, with no time delays or costs incurred.  I very much welcome that.  This efficient procedural approach is repeated at the conclusion of the three-year supervision period for the debt relief notice or on the conclusion by the parties concerned of a successful debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement proposal prior to its formal registration.  A court hearing will only be necessary subsequently where a creditor objects on one of the grounds specified in the legislation.  This is consistent with the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>This enhancement of court involvement has the significant benefit to the debtor of providing protection from enforcement actions by creditors, either during the negotiation period or during the lifetime of the arrangement.  It is likely that debtors would be the subject of judgments obtained by creditors.  In addition, the involvement of the court also ensures our new processes will be capable of meeting the criteria in regard to the European Union insolvency regulations and will recognise cross-border insolvency procedures.</P>
        <P>The Bill will continue the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, which got under way in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The critical new provision is the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after three years in place of the current 12-year arrangement.  We have seen high profile cases recently of what is called &ldquo;bankruptcy tourism&rdquo;, the most notable in my constituency being the case of Mr. Tom McFeely, the Priory Hall developer.  Will the Minister clarify how the Bill will affect this type of behaviour in future?</P>
        <P>The insolvency service of Ireland will be established to operate the new insolvency processes and provide a focal point for development of insolvency policy.  Organisation and planning for the new service is under way and I understand the director designate will likely be appointed during the summer.  However, as the new service will administer a completely new approach to insolvency in the State, with new and complex legal provisions, it is going to take time to become operational.  I understand the concerns of those who want an immediate introduction but it is better to the get the service right rather than rush it, which has happened all too often in policy formation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The provisions of this Bill will require careful consideration by all those involved in it.  However, individual circumstances vary and the solutions found within the context of the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes will also vary.  It should be emphasised that the Bill makes clear that those persons experiencing debt difficulties should primarily engage with lenders and negotiate an appropriate settlement.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I emphasise the Bill makes it clear that those experiencing debt difficulties should primarily engage with their lenders to negotiate an appropriate settlement.  Lenders should also engage properly with customers.  There is no question of the Government forcing settlements on either debtors or creditors.  Such an approach would run into legal and constitutional difficulties.  The new debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes described in the Bill facilitate a voluntary deal between a debtor and a specified majority of his or her creditors.  We should not forget many different creditors may be potentially involved in the new processes.  Many persons or companies may be both debtors and creditors.  While I understand the strong antipathy towards financial institutions and their contribution to our current economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to introduce reformed, workable and balanced insolvency legislation.  Such legislation is a required feature of any properly functioning economy.  It will assist not only debtors and financial institutions, but also corner shops, tradespersons and local co-operatives.</P>
        <P>All debtors and creditors are concerned by this reform.  For their sake and the sake of the wider economy, all must be treated fairly.  Many individuals are in personal financial difficulty because of the failure of other individuals to pay for work properly completed or goods or services supplied to them.  The underlying philosophy of the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement is that the insolvent debtor will, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, put forward what he or she considers to be a realistic offer to his or her creditors which would restore the debtor to solvency within a reasonable period while at the same time giving creditors a better financial outcome than the alternatives of debt enforcement or bankruptcy.  The creditors will need to consider carefully the debtor&rsquo;s offer, conscious that if they refuse, the debtor has another option, namely, the standard debt discharge procedure available under the reformed bankruptcy laws.  This is the ultimate appeal mechanism of the debtor.  However, in this eventuality - which is best avoided - control is effectively lost by both sides.  It would make sense for the debtor and creditor, especially where there is only one main creditor, to seek to conclude an agreement together.  The reforms contained in the Bill, in addition to providing new legal remedies, provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to resolve debt issues with their customers.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement are specifically designed, as far as is practicable, to facilitate a debtor&rsquo;s continued ownership and occupation of his or her principal private residence, unless the debtor does not wish to do so or the costs of the debtor continuing to reside in it are disproportionately large.</P>
        <P>The issue of reasonable living expenses is of particular importance in the application process for debt relief notices.  I dealt with a harrowing case at my advice centre yesterday and unfortunately such cases are all too common.  Where an applicant has a disposable income of less than &euro;60 per month after allowing for reasonable living expenses, and assets and savings of less than &euro;400, with exemptions for essential household or work items and a vehicle worth up to &euro;1,200, he or she will be entitled to a presumption of qualifying for the debt relief notice by the insolvency service in making its determination.</P>
        <P>I hope the provisions contained in the Bill will act as a catalyst for honest, open and constructive engagement between unsecured and secured creditors and those in genuine substantial financial difficulty.  The Bill provides concrete options for those genuinely unable to discharge their financial obligations as opposed to those who can but will not do so.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekNolan"><NameTxt>Deputy Derek Nolan</NameTxt>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister and commend him, the departmental officials and all those who worked on the preparation of the Bill.  I understand it was extremely difficult and required much legal checking and careful drafting, and it is a credit to those who drafted it and worked on it.</P>
        <P>Many Members of the House have welcomed the Bill, including those involved in the previous Administration who were 14 years in government.  If anything is a legislative monument to the failures of their policies over the years, it is the Bill, because it has been created to deal with the disastrous consequences laden on families and individuals throughout the country who were caught up in an unsustainable economic model based on nothing more than revaluing land and property and constantly refinancing them so people were burdened with more and more debt.</P>
        <P>We had an economy in which it was considered socially acceptable and morally right for young couples with limited means to borrow ten times their income to live in a semi-detached house in the suburbs.  This was the type of value held by the society we had.  These couples are now struggling because one of them may have lost a job due to the collapse of a construction sector based on shoddy foundations and the consequent spreading of this collapse into the domestic economy, and they are stuck with a huge debt on a modest home which is crippling them.  To help these people primarily we must bring forward this Bill to allow them have some hope they can resolve their financial difficulties.  To hear some of the pontificating and self-righteous remarks from the Fianna F&aacute;il Members during the debate on the Bill is quite simply galling, and they ought to reflect when they come to speak here and have a little more of a humble tone in their voices.</P>
        <P>There are two ways to deal with debt settlement.  One either writes it off or gives people the means and ability to pay it back.  I do not see the Bill as the be all and end all of dealing with the debt problems in the country.  The main thing we should do is try to get people back to work, increase their incomes and get the economy functioning again so people can afford their debt and pay it back.  This is the most logical way to deal with it and it is the way which will have the best impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Unfortunately, even if we do so, the problem is still so immense the Bill will be very important.</P>
        <P>Every day in their advice centres public representatives deal with the consequences of the disastrous economic policies and the disastrous lending by banks.  Families and individuals come to speak to me and one would be surprised at some of the people who are in trouble.  These include people with good jobs who have mortgages of more than &euro;1 million and cannot afford them any more and people on very limited incomes and social welfare.  The debt crisis is not confined to any demographic or sector of society; it is widespread and invidious and is causing untold concern.  If a study were to be done on the impact of debt on health, stress levels and family life it would show a disastrous and very dangerous tendency.</P>
        <P>I welcome the three main provisions of the Bill, namely, the debt relief notice, the debt settlement agreement and the personal insolvency arrangement.  They are very helpful and will have many benefits.  The practitioners involved must take cognisance of the very fragile state of those coming to see them with difficulties and problems, and a very compassionate approach must be taken.  The drafting of the provisions in the Bill on the delivery of the service is technical, but when these services come to be delivered, care and attention must given to those in a situation they never thought they would be.  They may have a sense of shame, which they should not have, or a sense of powerlessness and futility that they cannot control their own financial arrangements which is hurting them and in some cases making them feel they are lesser people because of it.  This needs to be taken into account in any delivery of service.  Adequate training must be provided for those who will be involved with personal insolvency practitioners, and MABS will also be involved, to ensure people are treated with respect and dignity, and that their situations and any possible mental stress are understood.</P>
        <P>The problem is immense.  Figures show that at the end of March 77,630 mortgages representing more than 10% of all mortgages were in arrears for more than 90 days.  Those figures are telling but what they do not tell one is that mortgages are what people pay first.  People will sacrifice food, car, light and heating bills to ensure the mortgage is paid first because of the attitude in this country that one&rsquo;s house is the most important thing.  Those figures, while dramatic, mask another level of debt which is below the surface and with which people are struggling.</P>
        <P>I like the idea of the independent insolvency service.  That is very helpful.  This legislation cannot be seen in isolation.  The announcement, almost at the same time, of the mortgage-to-rent scheme to help people, who will never be in a position to pay back the debt, to remain in their homes with their families entrenched in the same community, with their children going to the same schools, availing of the same services and with the same neighbours.  Merely changing the structure from ownership to renting is a revolutionary idea.  I know the targets are quite limited but a couple of thousand people are expected to avail of it.  It is socially compassionate and socially right and I very much support it as another element of the manner in which the Government is dealing with insolvency legislation and people&rsquo;s debts.</P>
        <P>There are few issues which I am sure can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister will commit to engaging fully on Committee Stage even though I know he has a very ambitious timeframe, and rightly so, to get the legislation implemented by the end of the year.  One is the debt relief notice.  I note the figure of &euro;20,000 has been set as the ceiling for that.  Having talked to people in MABS in Galway and in the citizens advice bureau who deal with these issues, a higher limit - although not a significantly higher one - of perhaps &euro;30,000 would be a much more appropriate level and may have a greater and an immediate impact and keep people out of the next layer.  It would keep people in the lower layer, which can be dealt with quickly.  The issue of the attachment order that can apply after the three years of bankruptcy has been raised.  That may defeat some of the purpose and attractiveness of the bankruptcy period of three years if it is not amended.  I am sure the detail and the logic of that can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I support this legislation.  What I really like about it is that it takes people away from lawyers.  People are terrified of, and are intimidated by, the courts, solicitors and lawyers.  The idea of this being non-judicial is more cost effective and allows for more human, trusting and relaxed interaction with people who are already in a very fragile state.  Again, I welcome the Bill, although there is some work to be done on Committee Stage to clarify some issues and to see if there are other possibilities.  Overall, I commend the Minister, the Government and the officials on drafting the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>Like every other speaker, I welcome the motivation behind this Bill.  There is no doubt that it is a recognition of an extraordinarily acute problem which is growing by the day and which probably should be tackled even more urgently than it is being tackled.  It has not been properly recognised by the banks but politicians are now beginning to recognise it because of the awful difficulties which they are finding among their constituents on a daily basis, in particular in the area of mortgage debt, although not exclusively mortgage debt as there are bigger debts and smaller debts.  This Bill certainly attempts to tackle these problems in a methodical, forensic and genuinely well motivated way to relieve the distress of many people who are suffering absolutely insuperable problems.</P>
        <P>What worries me about the Bill is that it seems to be guided by extraordinarily conservative and institutionalised thinking.  Although there are some novel suggestions in the detail, and it is new territory, there seems to be a pattern that those who are controlling the strings in our lending policies and institutions are still in positions of great strength.  I suppose the predecessor of, or the forerunner to, this Bill was the Keane report on mortgage arrears published last October, which shows the length of time it takes to get from pillar to post in problems of this depth.  The Keane report, whatever its recommendations - I do not think I will deal with them because they have been superseded - contained the thinking of institutionalised and official Ireland.  I say that because I could not understand when the Keane group was set up how and why the particular personnel were chosen.  Whatever the merits of the group, it was almost inevitable that it would come out with a report which was very acceptable to those who were in powerful positions in the lending institutions in Ireland.  It was stuffed with civil servants of great calibre, but certainly of a particular way of thinking, and two bankers for a reason I cannot understand.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it is all right and justifiable in a group with a membership of that size to have to bankers on it.  All the bankers in this saga are undoubtedly those who have the greatest case to answer but the following question has to be asked.  If the Government is tackling a problem of this nature, which is so serious for so many citizens and individuals, why did it not put on that group people who are directly affected by this problem and who are not sitting in some sort of self-interested ivory tower directing the operations?  Why was there not a representative of MABS, FLAC and of the enormous number of consumers and borrowers who are suffering?  Instead we got the usual suspects handing down a so-called solution or suggestions on mortgage arrears from the top.  It reflected conventional thinking.</P>
        <P>It is no wonder that after the publication of the Keane report, the first to welcome it was the Irish Banking Federation.  If one is going to get a panacea or a solution to a human problem of this sort, which is welcomed by the Irish Banking Federation, one must ask whether the input of this lobby group is stronger than the input of the people who are suffering?  As Deputy Nolan and other Deputies said, wherever the responsibility for this problem lies - I do not wish to allot it politically at this stage - the primary responsibility lies with the reckless lenders.  Certainly some of the responsibility lies with those who borrowed.  They included individual, responsible citizens who went to their banks, borrowed far too much and are now in serious difficulties.  They surely have a responsibility, too, but the primary responsibility across the board lies with banks and bankers.</P>
        <P>The three main categories dealt with by this Bill include the debt relief notice category, which involves very small borrowings.  The banks have a responsibility whether it concerns unsecured or secured debt, mortgage debt or even bigger debt.  The pattern is that the banks were drip-feeding citizens, businessmen and irresponsible people, playing on their weaknesses and handing out vast sums of money which they could not possibly have been able to afford to pay back.  To suggest now that those institutions are the ones that should be the greatest influence on the preliminary solution is bad enough.  The problem, however, is that their influence on this Bill is very detectable as well.</P>
        <P>The Irish Banking Federation has criticised one or two elements of the Bill, which I suspect is tactical.  The Bill, however, fails to recognise that the villains of the piece in the insolvency problems faced by Ireland are the same people today as they were in 2008 and before that.  The apparent influence they have had on this Bill is both obvious and regrettable.  Let me be more specific.  Everybody knows that the IBF beat a path to every Minister&rsquo;s door.  Some Ministers are more accessible than others but it is clear that in the case of all Ministers the IBF has a major influence.  The power of the banks has not been broken or reduced.  When it comes down to the nitty-gritty, they have had an absolutely unacceptable input into legislation.  The threat which they carried with them on 29 September 2008 is still there and they are still listened to as though they have some sort of authority.  They have got power but they should not be given the same deference today as they were given in 2008.</P>
        <P>The problem is manifest in this Bill when it comes to the arrangements being made between debtors and creditors.  It seems clear that the arrangement being made between debtors and creditors - however many intermediaries there are, and whatever insolvency monitoring goes on - unequal.  This is because the debtor, particularly in cases of house mortgages, only has one weapon.  The creditor, which is nearly always the bank, has several.  The arrangement which is made leaves the debtor with one option if he or she does not like it - bankruptcy.  The bank can walk away and veto it.  There is no doubt that there is a bank veto on the debtor, certainly in cases of mortgage arrears which have not been paid.  The idea that 65% - in value not in votes - is in some way a protection for the debtor is completely unacceptable.  Everybody knows that if a person has a mortgage, whatever the size, it is almost inevitable that it is, first, their largest debt and, second, it is a debt which is nearly always held by one bank or building society.  Even if it is not, it is not inconceivable that the banks, as they always have done, will gather together and gang up against the debtor.  It is an unequal relationship.</P>
        <P>I suggest there is only one way of removing the bank veto from an arrangement of this sort and that is by removing the bank.  That is what I mean by institutionalised thinking.  The idea that this Bill should give that power to those who have proved themselves to be manifestly unsuitable in their treatment of citizens and in their reckless lending in the past is unacceptable.  I do not understand why the Government did not decide to take the banks out of the equation.  As it is, they are certainly due back the money that is owed to them, which is the basic premise of this Bill.  The thrust and purpose of the legislation is to find a solution by which the borrower can pay back.</P>
        <P>Some months ago, there was a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill before the House which did not go far enough.  What was to stop the Government from setting up a body - I do not care whether it is judicial or non-judicial - that could call on both parties to be subject to its adjudication?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>That is an adjudication process, not a non-judicial process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>That body could outline how matters could be resolved.  There is no way banks can continue to be allowed to veto an arrangement of this sort.  They have proven themselves to be completely unsuitable.  An independent body should have been set up to tell both parties, if necessary, in as sympathetic a way as possible to the borrower, what the right solution would be.  To allow the banks to tell the borrower to take it or leave it as the alternative is bankruptcy, which is what is happening here, is completely unacceptable.  It is treating those who are in vulnerable situations in the normal bullying way that banks have acted for many years and certainly since the State started allowing them such latitude.</P>
        <P>The way to go was through an independent body.  However, to introduce a Bill which, if a person chooses the bankruptcy road at the behest of the banks because they have no other choice, allows no real appeal process is very dangerous.  I cannot understand why there is no appeal process.  I listened to what Deputy Stanton said about the possibility of the Credit Review Office becoming an appeals process but I find that puzzling.  It is more of the kind of institutionalised thinking which we are becoming very used to.  The Credit Review Office is a bankers&rsquo; gig and a failure.  It is now being pumped up and greeted as some sort of salvation for those small businesses and borrowers who have been treated badly by their bank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Creed</NameTxt>
        <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar Bille na Gaeltachta 2012.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire St&aacute;it.  N&iacute;l aon dabht ach go bhfuil an teanga i dtriobl&oacute;id mh&oacute;r.  C&eacute; nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam, t&aacute; s&eacute; d&rsquo;on&oacute;ir agam bheith mar Theachta D&aacute;la do Ghaeltacht Mh&uacute;scra&iacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; feicthe agam thar na blianta go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i dtriobl&oacute;id sa cheantar sin agus sna Gaeltachta&iacute; eile.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir sa census and in numerous other studies that the language is in considerable difficulty.  I wish to preface my remarks by congratulating the Minister on bringing forward a Bill with the primary function and purpose of addressing the stagnation, decline and the reversal in fortune of our native tongue.  If I am correct, this is the first time that a piece of primary legislation has been introduced with this aim in mind.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment to the language and I hope the Bill will be successful.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach seans a thabhairt do dhaoine nach bhfuil ach c&uacute;pla focal acu.  N&iacute;l &aacute;thas orm a r&aacute; go bhfuil saghas linguistic imperialism i measc cuid d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; &aacute;balta an teanga a labhairt go fl&uacute;irseach.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;&rdquo;.   N&iacute; cheapaim go dtugann iad si&uacute;d a bhfuil Gaeilge fl&uacute;irseach acu support agus encouragement d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bhfuil ag baint triail as agus nach bhfuil acu ach c&uacute;pla focal.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach that the Bill contains proposals for language planning areas.  This provision will give encouragement to the people who have some competence but who, like me, are not very comfortable in speaking the language.  I was very fortunate in my education to have attended Inchigeela national school which had a very enlightened approach to the language in a school which is outside the Gaeltacht.  The school did everything to foster and encourage an appreciation of the language.  However, in my view, it seems that some of those who are most competent in the language almost frown upon the people who are not as familiar or as competent.  The provision for language planning areas and the process involved in developing a plan for the promotion and advancement of the language, as envisaged in the Bill, is important.  We might delude ourselves into thinking that because the census shows that 1.7 million people can speak Irish that all is well, but this is patently not the case.  Numerous studies have confirmed this fact and if we were to do nothing, the language would probably enter into irreversible decline within the next 15 to 20 years.</P>
        <P>Much of the advancement of the language in recent years has not taken place in Gaeltacht areas but rather outside the Gaeltacht in the gaelscoileanna movement.  The education system has a significant role in the development of area language plans which will be community based.  In the formulation of those plans I would like to see all Gaeltacht schools being regarded as gaelscoileanna at both primary and post-primary level.  Unless there is immersion in a language, it is very difficult to arrest the decline.  The schools are a critical component.  Many, but not all the schools, operate as <i>de facto</i> gaelscoileanna in all but name.  I ask that local communities might consider this point when formulating area language plans.</P>
        <P>The Bill raises the prospect of redefining the geographical extent of the Gaeltacht areas and for new Gaeltacht areas to be considered because much of the advances in competence in the language have been made in areas outside of the Gaeltacht.  The reason for the decline in the language in the Gaeltacht areas has been emigration because native speakers have been forced to look for work outside the areas or abroad.  In the good times when jobs were available there was an influx into the Gaeltacht areas of people from outside and this must be taken into consideration when formulating local plans for Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the enterprise function which is currently fulfilled by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I am privileged to represent the Muskerry Gaeltacht.  I will not deny the problems of unemployment in my constituency or in the Muskerry Gaeltacht but I have noted local entrepreneurial successes and the area has been fortunate to have an effective representative on the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Scannaill.  However, I am concerned that to some degree there has been a diminution of the enterprise function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta with the proposal to have formal links in one way or another with Enterprise Ireland or the IDA.  I live in Macroom which lies just outside the Muskerry Gaeltacht.  We rarely have visits from Enterprise Ireland or the IDA while the opposite is the case in the Muskerry Gaeltacht.   That could be to the detriment of the enterprise function &Uacute;dar&aacute;s currently fulfils.</P>
        <P>I read somewhere with regard to the budget for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and I do not wish to make a major point about this because I have not had time to research its veracity, that over 50% of its budget allocation is spent on administrative costs.  That appears to be extraordinarily high, notwithstanding the compliments I have paid to the body.  Of the 2012 allocation of &euro;19 million, &euro;5.9 million was for capital expenditure, &euro;3.2 million was for current expenditure and &euro;9.8 million, which is more that 50%, was for administration.  That is an extraordinarily high proportion of a budget to be spent on administration.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that in our understandable preoccupation with the language there is a danger the equally critical component that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has fulfilled to date in respect of the language and enterprise will be lost.  As a result of its role in assisting and encouraging local entrepreneurship there are plenty of success stories in the Gaeltacht communities for enterprises that have been grant aided by &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta. However, there is a real danger that establishing formal links with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will, to some extent, diminish the role the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s can play in the future in this regard.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me that this will not be the case.</P>
        <P>The other issue I wish to raise is board membership of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Personally, I do not have a big problem with the fact that there will not be elections.  It is not that we fear elections because we have had considerable success in them in the area I represent.  I understand the determination, in the context of the language, to have expertise in that area on the board and I do not have a difficulty in principle with the board being reduced to 12 members.  However, I have a significant difficulty with the differentiation that the process outlined in the Bill will impose on the smaller Gaeltacht areas.  The Minister and I have discussed this matter on a number of occasions previously and I hope he will be able to bring forward amendments that will meet my concerns.  The Muskerry, Waterford and Meath Gaeltachta&iacute;, in particular, will no longer have automatic nominees on the board.  These are the three smallest Gaeltachta&iacute;.</P>
        <P>If Members recall the Lisbon treaty, we strongly opposed the suggestion that was floated at one stage that small countries would not have an automatic right to nominate a Commission member.  We considered it a cornerstone of our commitment to the European Union that every member state should be treated equally.  The same principle applies here.  In fact, there is considerable credit and recognition due to those small Gaeltachta&iacute; that they have survived and prospered in difficult times.  If anything, it is the interests and future of the smaller Gaeltachta&iacute; that that should be reassured and copperfastened in a new board.  Critical mass in terms of population for Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, which coincidentally happen to include the constituencies of the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and the Taoiseach, means those areas have a right under the current process to have a nominee.  However, I do not understand the logic of saying that Cork, Waterford and Meath should be excluded.  That is fundamentally unfair and I urge the Minister to look at it again.</P>
        <P>The current proposal is that Cork, Waterford and Meath should have a rotating entitlement every two years.  Even in terms of corporate governance, all members of a board should be of equal standing and have a right to serve terms of the same duration.  There is a likelihood that somebody who will only be on the board for two years will only have their feet under the table when they will have to start getting ready to depart, to be replaced by another member who will have similar insecurity and short tenure.  That is fundamentally unfair.  There are a number of possible alternatives the Minister could consider which would not significantly impact on the functioning of the board.  I will suggest three in order of preference.</P>
        <P>First, I suggest that the Minister leave the board at 12 members, but reduce the number of ministerial nominees from seven to five.  That would automatically give Waterford, Cork and Meath membership of the board.  The second preference is that the Minister could increase the board membership from 12 to 14.  This will involve minor additional costs, which are insignificant in the overall running of the board.  It would meet the requirement that Cork, Waterford and Meath would have representation on the board.  The third option, which I advance reluctantly, is to remove the right of local authorities of all Gaeltacht areas to nominate anybody to the board, so at least there would not be discrimination against any sector.  The Minister could reserve to himself, his Department and his ministerial successors the right to nominate all the members of the board.  That is my least preferred alternative proposal to what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister has scope to deal with this issue.  What is in the Bill is a slight on the Muskerry Gaeltacht and the other smaller Gaeltachta&iacute; and that is unfair.  No rationale has been advanced in the Bill, that I can see, to explain why this should be the case.  I sincerely urge the Minister, on what is otherwise an important day for the language and for the objectives in the Bill, to reconsider this critical issue and treat all the Gaeltachta&iacute; equally.  It is essential.  We have discussed this matter previously and I am aware it is something the Minister is considering.  I await his reply to this debate and the amendments he will table.  It is critical that the small Gaeltachta&iacute; are not discriminated against in terms of board membership.</P>
        <P>We have seen what effective representation on the board can achieve.  Notwithstanding that there is a lone voice for the Muskerry Gaeltacht on the board, it has worked effectively for that area.  The same can be said for Waterford and Rath Cairn Gaeltacht in Meath.  This regrettable shortcoming in the Bill can be easily resolved if there is the political will to do so.  I have advanced three possible ways of dealing with it.  It is an issue the Minister should consider in his reply to this debate and in amendments.  I understand time is important and that the debate will conclude next week, but I believe it is possible to draft appropriate amendments in that short time.</P>
        <P>This is not a pitch for an individual member.  I appreciate that the skills set required is people with language competence and, importantly, people with enterprise skills and people who have the capacity to conduct business through the medium of Irish.  I do not mind if the Minister has a prerequisite in terms of the skills set required.  Local authorities are not necessarily obliged to nominate council members, but there is a way to solve this.  We can advance the interests of the language, the Gaeltacht areas and the position of the language across the country in a harmonious fashion if these issues can be addressed.</P>

Ba cheart don Aire breis ama a th&oacute;g&aacute;il, mar n&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh tada m&oacute;r&aacute;n i m&iacute; L&uacute;nasa agus d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh muid C&eacute;im an Choiste a bheith againn as seo go dt&iacute; an l&aacute; go dtiocfaidh an D&aacute;il ar ais tar &eacute;is an tsamhraidh.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh muid ansin an Bille a acht&uacute; ina Acht.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; go leor pl&eacute; d&eacute;anta agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an bpl&eacute;.  T&aacute; daoine a cheapann nach bhfuil ann de Ghaeilge ach an Ghaeilge a labhartar sna Gaeltachta&iacute; &ldquo;A&rdquo; mar a thugann siad orthu.  T&aacute; a fhios agam gur labhair an tAire St&aacute;it ar an raidi&oacute; faoi sin an l&aacute; faoi dheireadh.  Creidim gur don phobal uilig an Ghaeilge agus mar sin, nach f&eacute;idir pl&eacute; leis an Ghaeilge gan todcha&iacute; na Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re ar fad a th&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh.  Rud eile, t&aacute; daoine ag tuar b&aacute;is don Ghaeilge le fada an l&aacute;.  L&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; amach anseo rud a d&uacute;radh 150 bliain &oacute; shin:</P>
        <P LI="1">As to the Irish language, toleration and patronage have come too late.  It cannot be saved alive by any human power.  It is at present confined to about one-third of the peasantry, and those the most ignorant and uncivilised.  As a spoken language, it can hardly survive the present generation.  The fathers and mothers will retain it till their death, but by the children it will be neglected and forgotten.  The time for educating them in the native language has gone by for ever.  It is not the language of business, of modern civilisation and it will not enable a man to get on the world.  However we may regret it that any language, especially one so primitive, so expressive, so powerful as the Gaelic should cease to live, its doom is inevitable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">D&uacute;radh sin 150 bliain &oacute; shin.  Ag an am sin, bh&iacute; an ceart ag an t&eacute; a scr&iacute;obh &eacute; mar s&eacute;ard a bh&iacute; ag tarl&uacute; n&aacute; go raibh Gaeilge amh&aacute;in ag an gc&eacute;ad gl&uacute;in, Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla ag an dara gl&uacute;in agus gan ach B&eacute;arla ag an tri&uacute; gl&uacute;in.  D&aacute; dtiocfadh an t&eacute; a scr&iacute;obh &eacute; sin ar ais inniu, bheadh an-iontas air go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo i saol in ar f&eacute;idir &eacute;isteacht le&iacute; &oacute; cheann ceann an domhain ar an Idirl&iacute;on agus i saol go bhfhuil an B&eacute;arla chomh l&aacute;idir n&iacute; amh&aacute;in in &Eacute;irinn ach ar fud an domhain, ach ag an am c&eacute;anna go maireann an Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il breathn&uacute; ar na staitistic&iacute;.  T&aacute; 77,000 duine ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras oideachais.  Ta 23,000 &aacute; labhairt go laeth&uacute;il sa Ghaeltacht. Sa St&aacute;t seo, t&aacute; thart ar 1.77 milli&uacute;n adeir go bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  D&aacute; gcuirfe&aacute; na daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu i dTuaisceart &Eacute;ireann le sin agus na daoine ar fud an domhain a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu, t&aacute; i bhfad os cionn 2 mhilli&uacute;n.  Sin an m&eacute;id is m&oacute; cainteoir&uacute;, n&oacute; an m&eacute;id is m&oacute; daoine le heolas ar an teanga le fada an l&aacute;.  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;onn muid ar na figi&uacute;r&iacute; compar&aacute;ideach, t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il go bhfuil, mar shampla, m&eacute;ad&uacute; tagtha ar l&iacute;on na ndaoine adeir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu idir an d&aacute; daon&aacute;ireamh deiridh.  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;onn muid ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re, t&aacute; an l&iacute;on sin m&eacute;adaithe &oacute; 72,000 in imeacht c&uacute;ig bliana go 77,000.  Sin m&eacute;ad&uacute; de 5,000 duine.  T&aacute; daoine ag caint ar bh&aacute;s na Gaeilge, ach don ch&eacute;ad uair t&aacute; fianise neamh chlaonta staitistici&uacute;il go bhfuil l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge, taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras oideachais, ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; agus istigh sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an l&iacute;on daoine a labhr&aacute;ionn Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il imithe in airde 500.  T&aacute; s&eacute; m&eacute;adaithe anois go 23,175.  M&eacute;ad&uacute; beag &eacute; sin, ach is m&eacute;ad&uacute; at&aacute; ann, seachas meath.  D&aacute; mbeadh na staitisc&iacute; againn don daon&aacute;ireamh roimhe sin, faraoir n&iacute;l siad againn, is d&oacute;igh gur meath a bheadh i gceist ag an am.  Mar sin, t&aacute; toradh ar iarrachta&iacute; a rinneadh thar blianta fada.</P>
        <P>Chomh maith le sin, t&aacute; staitistic&iacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;la eile ann agus muid ag breathn&uacute; ar an nGaeltacht.  I leabhar a d&rsquo;fhoilsigh m&rsquo;athair <i>Irish Dialects and Irish-Speaking Districts</i>  rinne s&eacute; taighde an-ghrinn sa bhliain 1950 a bh&iacute; bunaithe ar daon&aacute;ireamh 1948.  Ag an am sin, d&rsquo;oibrigh seisean amach nach raibh 35,000 duine de chainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  B&rsquo;shin roimh t&uacute;s na gcaogaid&iacute;, am a raibh imirce an-mh&oacute;r as an nGaeltacht.  Is ansin a th&aacute;inig m&eacute;ad&uacute; m&oacute;r, mar shampla, ar chathair na Gaillimhe agus athr&uacute; m&oacute;r ar an saol.  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;onn muid ar 60 bliain &oacute;  shin i leith, t&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il a fheice&aacute;il nach bhfuil an figi&uacute;r tite - ainneoin an m&eacute;id a deirtear faoin Ghaeilge a bheith ag f&aacute;il bh&aacute;is - &oacute; 35,000 duine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il go 23,000.  Ach t&aacute; athruithe m&oacute;ra taobh istigh de sin.  Glacaim leis nach bhfuil na Gaeltachta&iacute; nach bhfuil iontu ach Gaeilge chomh l&aacute;idir, mar t&aacute; daoine ag bogadh isteach an t-am ar fad, mar t&aacute; daoine i bhfad n&iacute;os soghluaiste.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus sna breac Gaeltachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il, mar t&aacute; deiseanna ann nach raibh ann cheana.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; thall i Londain le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; agus t&aacute; dream thall ansin a bh&iacute;onn ag &eacute;isteacht le &ldquo;Nead na Fuiseoige&rdquo; chuile mhaidin ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, rud n&aacute;rbh fh&eacute;idir le imirceoir&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh 50, 40 n&oacute; 20 bliain &oacute; shin.</P>
        <P>Caithfimid an cheist a chur orainn f&eacute;in c&eacute;ard a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il an Ghaeilge agus c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuair s&iacute; b&aacute;s ar n&oacute;s mar a thuar an duine a scr&iacute;obh an p&iacute;osa a l&eacute;igh m&eacute; n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce.  Dar liomsa gur iad taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n St&aacute;t agus stad&aacute;s oifigi&uacute;il a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il an Ghaeilge.  Bh&iacute; sin le f&aacute;il &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il i 1919 agus &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an ch&eacute;ad Rialtas anseo tar &eacute;is an chonartha.  I measc na ruda&iacute; m&oacute;ra a rinne difr&iacute;ocht don Ghaeilge agus do stad&aacute;s na Gaeilge n&aacute;: an Bunreacht; bunadh Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta; bunadh TG4; i rith na tr&eacute;imhse deiridh den Rialtas, tugadh seasamh oifigi&uacute;il don Ghaeilge don ch&eacute;ad uair i dTuaisceart &Eacute;ireann tr&iacute; Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta;  buna&iacute;odh Foras na Gaeilge mar &aacute;is&iacute;neacht uile-&Eacute;irinn; tugadh isteach an tAcht Teanga, at&aacute; ag baint go leor den ghangaid as c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga mar anois t&aacute; dream neamhsple&aacute;ch ann ag baint leis na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin; agus bhunaigh muid Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga, at&aacute; in ann seasamh do chearta Gaeilgeoir&iacute; go neamhsple&aacute;ch.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhf&aacute;gfar an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ina &aacute;it mar is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil obair iontach d&eacute;anta aige, mar n&iacute; gh&aacute; do Ghaeilgeoir a bheith ina gcancr&aacute;n n&iacute;os m&oacute; nuair a fheictear faill&iacute; n&oacute; &eacute;ag&oacute;ir &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh i leith na teanga.</P>
        <P>Thug muid isteach Bille substainti&uacute;il, An Bille um &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Fuair muid seasamh oifigi&uacute;il don Ghaeilge san Aontas Eorpach mar theanga oibre.  Thosaigh muid ansin ar an bpl&eacute; fada mar gheall ar thodhca&iacute; na Gaeilge.  Thosaigh muid leis an gCoimisi&uacute;n Gaeltachta.  Ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as sin, rinne muid an staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta ar an Ghaeltacht agus ansin, nuair a bhreathnaigh muid air, thuig muid nach f&eacute;idir leis an Ghaeltacht maireacht&aacute;il mar oile&aacute;n agus go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht agus todhca&iacute; na Gaeltachta fite fuaite le todhca&iacute; na Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r ar fad, agus thosaigh muid ag obair ar an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur chaill muid bliain le sin dh&aacute; chur ar aghaidh chuig an coiste D&aacute;la anseo, ach ag an am c&eacute;anna, bh&iacute; iarracht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn le d&eacute;anamh cinnte go mbeadh daoine agus p&aacute;irtithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la ag tac&uacute; leis na strait&eacute;ise.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; tr&iacute; ghn&eacute; ann le go mairfidh teanga: dearcadh, eolas agus &uacute;s&aacute;id.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an dearcadh naimhdeach don teanga - chonaic muid &eacute; seo sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht le 200 bliain anuas - agus m&aacute; t&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh na Gaeilge a chaitheamh d&iacute;obh, n&iacute;l aon todhca&iacute; ann don Ghaeilge.  Is cuma c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad eolas at&aacute; ag daoine ar an teanga, muna dteasta&iacute;onn uathu &iacute; a thabhairt don ch&eacute;ad gl&uacute;in eile n&iacute;l aon mhaith ann.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il breathn&uacute; ar dhearcadh daoine ar an nGaeilge.  Mar is eol don Teach, tugadh airgead don Athair Mac Gr&eacute;il le staid&eacute;ar an-chuimsitheach a dh&eacute;anamh ar an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; 7% sa St&aacute;t at&aacute; ag iarraidh go bhfaighfidh an Ghaeilge b&aacute;s agus t&aacute; 93% ag iarraidh go mairfidh s&iacute;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il freisin go bhfuil 53% de dhaoine ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chaomhn&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht, c&eacute; nach bhfeiceann siad iad fh&eacute;in mar chuid den athbheochan.  Ba mhaith leo go mairfeadh an teanga.  Ceapann siad gur iarsma f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach stairi&uacute;il &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  Creideann 40% de dhaoine go mbaineann an Ghaeilge leo f&eacute;in agus gur cheart &iacute; a athbheochan.  Is ollfigi&uacute;r &eacute; sin le hais suirbh&eacute; &eacute;igin mar seo a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh a bheith d&eacute;anta deich mbliana &oacute; shin.  Nuair a dh&eacute;anann muid scr&uacute;d&uacute; ar na figi&uacute;r&iacute; seo, faigheann muid eolas n&iacute;os sp&eacute;isi&uacute;la f&oacute;s.  T&aacute; s&eacute; l&eacute;irithe gurb iad an dream &oacute;g agus uirbeach, a bhfuil postanna maithe agus ard-leibh&eacute;al oideachais acu, an dream is b&aacute;&uacute;la don Ghaeilge sa t&iacute;r seo.  Is iad si&uacute;d is m&oacute; at&aacute; i bhf&aacute;bhar na hathbheochana.  Nuair at&aacute; meon an phobail ag bogadh agus ruda&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la ag teacht i bhfaisean, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go leanann an socha&iacute; i gcoitinne an dream &oacute;g le postanna maithe agus oideachas fairsing.  T&aacute; dul chun cinn f&iacute;or-suntasach d&eacute;anta &oacute; thaobh dearcadh an phobail i leith na teanga.</P>
        <P>L&eacute;irigh an staid&eacute;ar go bhfuil go leor daoine le heolas acu ar an teanga, ach nach n-&uacute;s&aacute;ideann &iacute; go laeth&uacute;il n&oacute; go rialta.  Rinneadh r&eacute;imni&uacute; agus briseadh s&iacute;os idir eolas an-mhaith, r&eacute;as&uacute;nta agus mar sin de.  T&aacute; eolas ar an teanga i bhfad chun cinn ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar sin in aon phlean&aacute;il at&aacute; ar bun.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn scr&uacute;d&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar conas is f&eacute;idir aistri&uacute; &oacute;n eolas go dt&iacute; an &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain d&iacute;rithe ar sin.  T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is ag iarraidh a chinnti&uacute; nach g&aacute; tosach as an nua sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais i ngach gl&uacute;in.  Muna labhrann tuismitheoir&iacute; le Gaeilge lena ngas&uacute;ir &iacute;, caithfidh na gas&uacute;ir dul ar gaelscoil, n&oacute; bealach &eacute;igin eile a th&oacute;g&aacute;il, leis an teanga a shealbh&uacute;.  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; nach bhfreastala&iacute;onn formh&oacute;r na ngas&uacute;ir ar gaelscoileanna ar aon chaoi.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, caithfear an Ghaeilge a m&uacute;ineadh n&iacute;os fearr sna scoileanna eile.  An smaoineamh a bh&iacute; taobh thiar den strait&eacute;is n&aacute; go n-&eacute;ire&oacute;dh linn n&iacute;os m&oacute; tuismitheoir&iacute; taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a spreagadh chun Gaeilge a labhairt lena gcuid gas&uacute;ir &oacute; chaitear ar a sop iad.</P>
        <P>Is cuimhin liom todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge a phl&eacute; le comhghleaca&iacute; de chuid duine de na St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh at&aacute; in &eacute;ineacht leis an Aire St&aacute;it inniu nuair a bh&iacute;omar thuas i dT&iacute;r Chonaill.  T&aacute; aithne maith ag an Aire St&aacute;it ar an duine at&aacute; i gceist agam.  D&uacute;irt m&eacute; gur cheart tosach nuair a bh&iacute;onn na m&aacute;ithreacha ag s&uacute;il.  Chuaigh an pl&eacute; ar aghaidh agus d&uacute;irt duine &eacute;igin gur cheart tosach &oacute;n am a thosa&iacute;onn s&iacute; bheith ag s&uacute;il.  D&uacute;irt an comhghleaca&iacute; sa Roinn a luaigh m&eacute; gur cheart tosach sna discos.  An pointe a bh&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh aige n&aacute; gur ciorcal at&aacute; ann.  M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir an f&aacute;inne f&iacute; a athr&uacute;, agus &aacute;iteamh ar dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu &iacute; a labhairt lena gcuid gas&uacute;ir, beidh spriocanna na strait&eacute;ise insroichte.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; daoine ann a chreideann gur cheart an Ghaeilge a choinne&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht.  N&iacute;l aon chiall leis sin ar go leor c&uacute;iseanna.  Go simpl&iacute;, n&iacute; mhairfeadh an teanga.  D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; nach raibh aon sp&eacute;is sa Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, bheadh deireadh leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge ar maidin.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th go dtiocfadh daoine go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht ag foghlaim na Gaeilge muna mbainfeadh s&iacute; leo?  Baineann todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta&iacute; is l&aacute;idre sa t&iacute;r le dearcadh agus sp&eacute;is na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; mar aidhm againn go mbeidh an teanga &aacute; labhairt ag daoine chuile &aacute;it sa t&iacute;r, caithfidh plean ollmh&oacute;r St&aacute;it a bheith againn.  N&iacute;l aon mhaith d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar p&oacute;ic&iacute;n&iacute; beaga Gaeltachta amh&aacute;in.  N&iacute; mharifidh an Ghaeilge ar an mbealach sin.</P>
        <P>Chuala m&eacute; bean as Inis O&iacute;rr ag caint go stuama agus go ciallmhar ar an gceist seo le gairid.  D&uacute;irt s&iacute; gur th&oacute;g s&iacute; c&uacute;igear n&oacute; seisear gas&uacute;ir, ach go mbeadh an t-&aacute;dh l&eacute;i d&aacute; bhfaigheadh duine amh&aacute;in acu post in Inis O&iacute;rr a thabharfadh deis d&oacute; n&oacute; di fanacht ar an oile&aacute;n.  D&rsquo;iarr s&iacute; nach mbeadh cur am&uacute; ioml&aacute;n i gceist iad a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge, d&aacute; mba rud &eacute; nach raibh s&iacute; ag s&uacute;il go nd&eacute;anfaid&iacute;s an rud c&eacute;anna, cib&eacute; c&eacute;n &aacute;it in &Eacute;irinn ina mbeid&iacute;s ag maireacht&aacute;il.  Nach mbeadh cur am&uacute; eolais, fuinnimh agus iarracht i gceist?  F&aacute;gann daoine an Ghaeltacht agus tagann daoine isteach go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht.  Nach mbeadh s&eacute; loighci&uacute;il bheith ag s&uacute;il go labhr&oacute;dh Polannach a bheadh ina ch&oacute;na&iacute; anseo in &Eacute;irinn Polainnis lena gcuid gas&uacute;ir anseo, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r os rud &eacute; go mbeidh B&eacute;arla acu ar aon chaoi?  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn breathn&uacute; ar muintir na Gaeltachta a th&eacute;ann ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; in &aacute;iteanna eile ar fud na t&iacute;re, agus a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge lena gclann, mar chuid d&rsquo;acmhainn na Gaeltachta agus mar chuid de phobal ioml&aacute;n labhartha Gaeilge na t&iacute;re.</P>
        <P>Caithfimid a fh&aacute;il in&aacute;r gcloigeann go bhfuil cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;ch&aacute;sa Gaeilge ann cheana f&eacute;in a t&oacute;gadh taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Muna bhfuilimid in ann na coincheapanna seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar bord, n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go mbeidh aon bhun&uacute;s leis an strait&eacute;is.  Mar is eol don Aire St&aacute;it, d&uacute;irt an strait&eacute;is go rabhamar ag iarraidh tr&iacute; rud a bhaint amach.  Is fi&uacute; iad a chur ar an taifead.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; s&eacute; molta sa strait&eacute;is go m&eacute;ad&oacute;idh an l&iacute;on daoine sa St&aacute;t seo a bhfuil eolas acu ar an nGaeilge go 2 mhilli&uacute;n.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; sin thar a bheith insroichte.  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar aidhm ag an strait&eacute;is an l&iacute;on daoine sa Ghaeltacht a labhrann an Ghaeilge go laeth&uacute;il a ard&uacute; &oacute; 23,000 go 30,000, n&oacute; 25%.  M&aacute; bhaineann muid na spriocanna sin amach, beidh f&aacute;s ag tarl&uacute; agus is d&oacute;cha go leanfaidh f&aacute;s f&aacute;s.  Ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc ag an strait&eacute;is l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r ar fad a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; go dt&iacute; 250,000.  Is &iacute; sin an aidhm is uaillmhiana&iacute; ar fad, os rud &eacute; go gcinnte&oacute;dh s&iacute; todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge go br&aacute;ch na breithe.  In aois na hidirl&iacute;ne, guth&aacute;in p&oacute;ca agus teagmh&aacute;il n&iacute;os m&oacute; le daoine nach bhfuil aithne agat orthu n&aacute; daoine at&aacute; c&oacute;ngarach dhuit, m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir linn an teanga a thabhairt ar aghaidh &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, beidh todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge sl&aacute;n.</P>
        <P>D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfainn go leor eile a r&aacute; faoin strait&eacute;is.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an strait&eacute;is &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r &oacute; thaobh r&eacute;imse an oideachais, r&eacute;imse an phobail agus mar sin de.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfar d&oacute;thain ama d&uacute;inn chun mionphl&eacute; dearfach a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille seo.  N&iacute; sh&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; go bhfuil lochtanna m&oacute;ra ag baint leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; an Bille sa mh&oacute;rphicti&uacute;r ag teacht leis an rud a r&eacute;itigh m&eacute; f&eacute;in - go gcaithfeadh an cur chuige plean&aacute;ilte seo a bheith ann.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta.  Nuair a d&rsquo;fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an Roinn, bh&iacute; m&eacute; d&iacute;reach tar &eacute;is obair ar an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a thos&uacute;.  T&aacute; lochtanna m&oacute;ra sa Bhille, &aacute;fach.  Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an chuid den mBille a bhaineann leis na gr&eacute;as&aacute;in Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;imid ag caint faoi f&aacute;s na Gaeilge n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach i ngr&eacute;as&aacute;in taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin.  Is ioma&iacute; gr&eacute;as&aacute;in Gaeilge at&aacute; ann.  T&aacute; go leor d&oacute;ibh ann nach raibh ann 50 bliain &oacute; shin.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom focal n&oacute; dh&oacute; a r&aacute; ar an mBille sula cr&iacute;ochn&oacute;idh m&eacute;.  Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad locht gur mhaith liom a lua n&aacute; an easpa airgid at&aacute; &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il.  Mar a d&uacute;radh i 1950, c&eacute;n chaoi a mairfidh an Ghaeilge i saol m&oacute;r an Bh&eacute;arla, at&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os treise anois n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; riamh sa stair, muna bhfuilimid s&aacute;sta roinnt acmhainn&iacute; a chaitheamh ar an teanga?  Fi&uacute; in am na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime, caithfimid roghanna a dh&eacute;anamh a chabhr&oacute;idh linn teacht ar na hacmhainn&iacute;.  M&aacute; thagann meath ar an nGaeilge, n&iacute; thiocfaidh s&iacute; ar ais.  N&iacute; glacaim leis an arg&oacute;int airgeadais faoi toghch&aacute;in an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n chaoi is f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go bhfuil fadhb airgid ann nuair at&aacute; an Rialtas ag caint ar breis toghch&aacute;in uachtar&aacute;nta agus iliomad reifreann in &eacute;adan a ch&eacute;ile a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l aon fhadhb airgead a fh&aacute;il le haghaidh toghch&aacute;in ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Beidh reifreann ar chearta leana&iacute; againn sa bhf&oacute;mhar.</P>
        <P>Mar sin, n&iacute; bh&eacute;adh aon chostas le toghch&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>An dream a bh&eacute;as ag d&eacute;anamh cinnidh de r&eacute;ir an Bhille, n&iacute; g&aacute; gur sp&eacute;is leo an Ghaeilge ar chor ar bith.  Sa chontae ina bhfuil c&oacute;na&iacute; orm f&eacute;in, t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; de na comharleoir&iacute; contae ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; taobh thoir den Choirib n&aacute; mar at&aacute; taobh thiar di.  Le fada an l&aacute;, &eacute;inne a bh&iacute; ar an gcomhairle contae d&rsquo;inseoid&iacute;s duit go n-&uacute;d&aacute;idtear an m&oacute;rlach sin in &eacute;adan an dream a bh&iacute; i gConamara.</P>
        <P>An tr&iacute;&uacute; rud, nach n-aonta&iacute;m leis an coibhneas &oacute; thaobh na plean&aacute;la de.  Caithfidh an St&aacute;t a bheith freagrach as plean&aacute;il.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; le pobal Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il sa riarach&aacute;n poibl&iacute;, mar shampla.  Caithfidh an St&aacute;t a bheith i mbun an phlean agus taca&iacute;ocht an phobail a bheith aige.  Gan taca&iacute;ocht an phobail n&iacute;l aon mhaith ann, ach caithfidh s&eacute; teacht &oacute;n St&aacute;t.</P>
        <P>N&iacute; aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire St&aacute;it faoi Fhoras na Gaeilge, mar n&iacute; fheicim c&eacute;n chaoi ar f&eacute;idir freagracht as plean&aacute;il teanga ar fud na t&iacute;re a thabhairt do dhream nach bhfuil smacht aige air.  N&iacute;l smacht ag an Rialtas ar Fhoras na Gaeilge.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; i mbun na Roinne, bh&iacute;odh mise ag r&aacute; go gcaithfeadh freagracht ioml&aacute;n as cur i bhfeidhm Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge fanacht taobh istigh den St&aacute;t, mar nach bhfuil aon smacht againn ar c&eacute;ard a shocr&oacute;s na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &oacute; Thuaidh, agus n&iacute; bh&eacute;inn s&aacute;sta an smacht sin a gh&eacute;illeadh d&oacute;ibh.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&eacute;anfaidh an t-Aire St&aacute;it machnamh thar an deireadh seachtaine.  B&rsquo;fhearr liom su&iacute; s&iacute;os leis, gan aon bhr&uacute; ama n&oacute; arg&oacute;int a bheith ann faoi chloig &aacute; mbualadh n&oacute; teorainn ama, agus an rud seo a phl&eacute; go mion.  Creidim f&eacute;in, agus d&rsquo;fhoghlaim m&eacute; seo ar an dtaobh eile den Teach, gur fearr reachta&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh go mion agus gan rud a dheifri&uacute;.  An rud is m&oacute; a tharraing triobl&oacute;id orm, &oacute; thaobh reachta&iacute;ochta de, n&aacute; rud a dheifrigh m&eacute; tr&iacute;d ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad deiridh.  D&rsquo;iarrfainn ar an Aire St&aacute;it fanacht go Me&aacute;n Fh&oacute;mhair le jab ceart a dh&eacute;anamh air seo.  D&eacute;arfadh s&eacute; liom, &ldquo;C&eacute;ard faoi thoghch&aacute;in an &uacute;dar&aacute;is?&rdquo;.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; teacht isteach anseo an tseachtain seo chugainn, le taca&iacute;ocht an Fhreas&uacute;ra, agus Bille aon l&iacute;ne a reacht&aacute;il chun na toghch&aacute;in a chur siar go deireadh M&iacute; Deireadh F&oacute;mhair n&oacute; M&iacute; na Samhna leis an bhfadhb bheag dl&iacute; sin a shar&uacute;.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaim&iacute;s &eacute; seo a phl&eacute; go mion thar an samhradh.  Creidim go mba cheart don Aire St&aacute;it a bheith oscailte do leasaithe.  D&rsquo;fhoghlaim mise, thall ansin ar an mb&iacute;nse a bhfuil an t-Aire St&aacute;it ina shu&iacute; air, a bheith i bhfad n&iacute;os oscailte do leasaithe n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag an t&uacute;s.  D&rsquo;iarrfainn ar an Aire St&aacute;it &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  In ionad go leor des na daoine a bheith ag r&aacute; go bhfuil tr&iacute; cheathr&uacute; den Bhille ceart agus go bhfuil cro&iacute; an Aire St&aacute;it san &aacute;it cheart ach go bhfuil an gn&iacute;omh m&iacute;cheart, mholfainn don Aire St&aacute;it d&eacute;anamh mar a rinne mise nuair a chuir m&eacute; an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010 - 2030 isteach sa gcoiste seachas &iacute; a dheifri&uacute; ar aghaidh, fi&uacute; gur chailleamar ama air sin, n&iacute;os m&oacute; ama n&aacute; mar a sh&iacute;l m&eacute;.  B&rsquo;fhi&uacute; &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh le daoine a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar bord.</P>
        <P>D&rsquo;iarrfainn ar an Aire St&aacute;it smaoineamh go domhain ar chr&iacute;ochn&uacute; ar an Dara Ch&eacute;im agus teacht ar ais agus an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a chr&iacute;ochn&uacute; sa bhf&oacute;mhar.  N&iacute;l ann ach rud beag le r&eacute;iteach le gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Le haghaidh todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge b&rsquo;fhearr an d&aacute; mh&iacute; a chaillleadh agus gn&iacute;omh ansin, agus gn&iacute;omh ar Bhille f&oacute;nta seachas gn&iacute;omh ar an rud at&aacute; &oacute;s &aacute;r gcomhair.  B&rsquo;fhearr a bheith ag feidhmi&uacute; le taca&iacute;ocht ioml&aacute;n an Oireachtais agus an phobail seachas daoine ag r&aacute; go bhfuil bunlochta&iacute; air seo.</P>

        <P>Le cead an T&iacute;, roinnfidh m&eacute; mo chuid ama leis an Teachta Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan.</P>
        <P>Seo an ch&eacute;ad uair dom r&aacute;iteas a dh&eacute;anamh as Gaeilge.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as ucht an Bhille a thabhairt os comhair an T&iacute;.  Seo an ch&eacute;ad Bille Gaeltachta le 56 bliana at&aacute; ag tagairt do na mapa&iacute; n&oacute; na limist&eacute;ir Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; a I&aacute;n ruda&iacute; athraithe sa t&iacute;r agus sa Gaeltacht &oacute;n am sin.  T&aacute; daonra n&iacute;os &aacute;irde againn i gcuid den Ghaeltachta agus t&aacute; titim sa daonra in &aacute;iteanna eile.  T&aacute; iomarca east&aacute;it nua t&oacute;gtha in &aacute;iteanna a raibh talamh feirmeoireachta iontu, go h&aacute;irithe i gcathair na Gaillimhe agus timpeall uirthi.  T&aacute; titim sa daonra in &aacute;iteanna eile, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r i gceantar Iorras Aithneach i gConamara.  I mo thuairim f&eacute;in, i gConamara t&aacute; ceithre limist&eacute;ar Gaeilge.  T&aacute; &aacute;iteannna ina bhfuil an teanga l&aacute;idir agus go bhfuil an daonra ag titim n&oacute; ag fanacht mar at&aacute;, is iad san Iorras Aithneach, Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n agus &Aacute;rainn; t&aacute; &aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil an teanga go l&aacute;idir agus go bhfuil an daonra ag mead&uacute;, &oacute; na Forbacha go dt&iacute; an Cheathr&uacute; Rua, ceantar Chois Fharraige; t&aacute; &aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil an teanga lag agus an daonra faoi bhr&uacute;, is iad san ceantair Seoighe agus Srath Salach; agus ta &aacute;iteanna thart ar Maigh Cuilinn agus Bearna, mo cheantar f&eacute;in, ina bhfuil an daonra ag f&aacute;s ach go bhfuil st&aacute;das na teanga lag.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; a I&aacute;n fadhbanna leis an teanga oifigi&uacute;il sa Ghaeltacht.  Rugadh mise i Maigh Cuilinn, Gaeltacht oifigi&uacute;il.  Ba cheantar &eacute; le Gaeilge r&eacute;as&uacute;nta blianta &oacute; shin ach t&aacute; titim sa chaighde&aacute;n.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th?  Bhuel, n&iacute;l a fhios agam ach uair amh&aacute;in, bh&iacute;odh gach &aacute;bhar &aacute; mh&uacute;ineadh tr&eacute; Ghaeilge sa scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus go minic n&iacute; raibh Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt sna tithe ar chor a bith.  Sin fadhb m&oacute;r.  M&aacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil Gaeilge sa teach ag na tuimitheoir&iacute; beidh fadbh ag na gas&uacute;ir.  I Maigh Cuilinn seachas scoil an Bhaile Nua n&iacute;l aon scoil I&aacute;n-ghaelach ann.  T&aacute; a I&aacute;n Gaeilge i gcuid acu. Caithfidh muid tosn&uacute; sa mbaile agus ansin sna scoileanna.  T&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre.</P>
        <P>Mar a d&uacute;irt me cheana, t&aacute; tithe nua t&oacute;gtha in &aacute;iteanna nach raibh mor&aacute;n daoine ina gc&oacute;nai iontu i 1956, nuair a d&rsquo;athraigh said an mapa Gaeltachta.  In &aacute;iteanna cos&uacute;il le Cnoc na Cathracha i gCathair na Gaillimh t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair a chreidi&uacute;int gur ceantar Gaeltacht at&aacute; i gceist.  Ach t&aacute; scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ansin le 437 dalta, is &eacute; sin Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, agus beidh Col&aacute;iste na Coiribe ag athr&uacute; go dti Cnoc na Cathracha sa mbliain 2013.  Is sc&eacute;al maith &eacute; sc&eacute;al Chnoc na Cathracha maidir le hoideachas tr&eacute; Ghaeilge agus t&aacute; scealta maithe eile in &aacute;iteanna cos&uacute;il le Eanach Dh&uacute;in sa taobh eile de dh&aacute;ilcheantar Ghaillimh Thiar.  Chas m&eacute; le gr&uacute;pa beag &oacute; Eanach Dh&uacute;in an tseachtain seo sa D&aacute;il.  Bh&iacute; said ar cuairt in &eacute;ineacht leis an gComhairleoir Mary Hoade agus labhair muid faoi &aacute;bhar na Gaeilge.  D&uacute;irt said liom go raibh an-obair d&eacute;anta ag an scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ag m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge agus gurb iad na p&aacute;isti as Eanach Dh&uacute;in na scol&aacute;iri is fearr sa Gaeilge sa me&aacute;n scoil in &Aacute;th Cinn.  D&uacute;irt said liom go raibh an-suim acu sa teanga agus go bhfuil said ag iarraidh fanacht sa Gaeltacht.  D&uacute;irt said go raibh ranganna Gaeilge sa gceantar agus go bhfuil said ag obair ar an teanga.  I mo cheantar f&eacute;in i Maigh Cuilinn, t&aacute; &aacute;iseanna nua t&oacute;gtha ag Conradh na Gaeilge do ranganna Gaeilge.  T&aacute; &aacute;is ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus is maith an rud &eacute; sin.</P>
        <P>D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh daoine ag breathn&uacute; ar ruda&iacute; mar at&aacute; said anois b&rsquo;fheidir go gceapfadh siad gur cheart nach mb&eacute;adh Cnoc na Cathrach, Eanach Dh&uacute;in agus &aacute;iteanna cos&uacute;il leo san nGaeltacht anois.  N&iacute; aonta&iacute;m leis sin. T&aacute; an t-Aire St&aacute;it ag d&eacute;anamh an rud ceart leis an mBille.</P>
        <P>M&aacute; theasta&iacute;onn tuilleadh ama &oacute; limist&eacute;ir&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht chun d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh faoina st&aacute;das sa Ghaeltacht ba ceart go mb&eacute;adh an t-am acu.  N&iacute; raibh aon athr&uacute; le 56 bliana.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ceart go nd&eacute;anfadh muid aon athr&uacute; gan comhairle &oacute;n bpobal n&oacute; gan plean &oacute;n bpobal.  Sin a theasta&iacute;onn sa Bhille Gaeltachta seo.</P>
        <P>Leis an mBille seo, beidh ar an bpobal plean teanga a ullmh&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go sol&eacute;ir san staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach teangeola&iacute;och ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht go mbeidh titim uaf&aacute;sach sa teanga mar theanga teaghlaigh agus sa phobal i gceann 15-20 bliain, gan gniomh&uacute;.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, beidh 19 limist&eacute;ar plean&aacute;la teanga faoi leith sa Ghaeltacht agus teasta&iacute;onn pleananna a ullmh&uacute;.  Beidh r&oacute;l ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sa phr&oacute;iseas seo.  Beidh &uacute;dar&aacute;s ag obair leis an bpobal i ngach limist&eacute;ir agus leis na heagraithe pobail, chun an plean teanga a cur chun cinn ar an talamh.  Beidh ar an Roinn breathn&uacute; ar na pleananna go dian sula nglacann an t-Aire leo.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; go mbeidh an pobal l&aacute;rnach i bpr&oacute;iseas ullmh&uacute; na bpleananna.  Teasta&iacute;onn suim an phobail chun st&aacute;das na Gaeltachta a choinne&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis An Teachta Dara Calleary inn&eacute; agus &eacute; ag caint faoi chl&aacute;r Leader agus Meitheal Forbartha Gaeltachta, MFG.  Aonta&iacute;m leis faoi na deacreachta&iacute; at&aacute; ag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la sa Ghaeltacht ach t&aacute; an t-&aacute;bhar sin r&eacute;itithe anois mar go bhfuil na ceantair Gaeltachta istigh le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile chun cl&aacute;r Leader a oibri&uacute; agus t&aacute; Comhairle Ceantar na n-Oile&aacute;n ag obair ar son Leader i gConamara.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe sin, ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; nach &eacute; an t-Aire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, n&oacute; an t-Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta McGinley, a rinne praiseach de MFG.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n cainte a r&aacute; go bhfuil an Bille seo chun deireadh a chur le toghch&aacute;n chuig bord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Tagann an chuid is m&oacute; den chaint seo &oacute; pholaiteoir&iacute;, cuid acu ar an mbord.  Caithfimid a bheith cinnte go mbeidh airgead coigilte mar gheall ar an athr&uacute; seo agus laghd&uacute; ar an m&eacute;id daoine a bheidh ar an mbord &oacute; 20 go dt&iacute; 12.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir &oacute; dhaoine ag a bhfuil taith&iacute; gn&oacute; ar fud ar domhain gur fearr bord le 12 n&aacute; bord le 20.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; go bhfuil daoine le taith&iacute; ghn&oacute; ar an mbord nua, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r le taith&iacute; cruth&uacute; post.  Is f&eacute;idir le duine ar bith a bhfuil suim aige bheith ar an bhord iarratas a chur isteach chuig <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Beidh na comhairl&iacute; contae in ann daoine a ainmni&uacute; &oacute; chomhairleoir&iacute; tofa ar feadh t&eacute;arma ioml&aacute;n oifige.  T&aacute; s&eacute; daonlathach.  Nuair a bh&iacute; an Taoiseach mar cheannaire Fhine Gael ag canbh&aacute;s&aacute;il liom in 2005 i gcathair na Gaillimhe, thart ar &Oacute;st&aacute;n Menlo, n&iacute; raibh m&oacute;r&aacute;n daoine le Gaeilge.  Le f&iacute;rinne, n&iacute; raibh m&oacute;r&aacute;n &Eacute;ireannach ann.  Bh&iacute; an ceantar sa Ghaeltacht go hoifigi&uacute;il ach n&iacute; raibh m&oacute;r&aacute;n daoine le Gaeilge agus bh&iacute; daoine &oacute; chuile &aacute;it sa domhan.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, n&iacute; raibh m&oacute;r&aacute;n c&eacute;ille go raibh v&oacute;ta&iacute; ag cuid de na daoine sa toghch&aacute;n sin.</P>
        <P>Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil an teanga ag f&aacute;s taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; Gaelscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re, at&aacute; iontach le feice&aacute;il.  Sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, n&iacute;l ach 24% n&oacute; 23,175 daoine, ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge gach l&aacute;.  Is figi&uacute;r lag &eacute; sin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; ann gur f&eacute;idir leis an Rialtas a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt ach n&iacute;l an Rialtas in ann dul isteach sna tithe ar fud na Gaeltachta le f&aacute;il amach an bhfuil tuismitheoir&iacute; n&oacute; na p&aacute;ist&iacute; ag caint i nGaeilge le ch&eacute;ile.  N&iacute;l aon fhadhb ann B&eacute;arla a fhoghlaim &oacute;n teilif&iacute;s n&oacute; &oacute; ph&aacute;ist&iacute; eile sa cheantar.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; go gcloiseann na p&aacute;ist&iacute; an Ghaeilge sa bhaile.</P>
        <P>I m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;in, d&rsquo;fhoilsigh an Roinn an cl&aacute;r taca&iacute;ochta do theaghlaigh.  Is &iacute; aidhm an chl&aacute;ir n&aacute; an Ghaeilge a fheabhs&uacute; mar theanga theaghlaigh agus phobail sa Ghaeltacht i gcomhth&eacute;acs na strait&eacute;ise 20 bliain.  T&aacute; bearta nua sa chl&aacute;r bheith ag obair leis an Roinn Sl&aacute;inte bille eolais a chur ar f&aacute;il do thuismitheoir&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht faoi na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhaineann le p&aacute;ist&iacute; a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;im na gc&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; teanga ann chomh maith sna scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht chun freastal n&iacute;os fearr a dh&eacute;anamh go mbeidh p&aacute;ist&iacute; in ann a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute;.</P>
        <P>Nuair a bh&iacute; an r&aacute;iteas seo &aacute; ullmh&uacute; agam, smaoinigh m&eacute; ar phlean na Gaeltachta a d&rsquo;fhoilsigh Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe in 2006.  Bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n cruinnithe againn ag an am sin chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; cead plean&aacute;la a phl&eacute;.  An cheist phr&aacute;inneach n&aacute; ar cheart cead plean&aacute;la a thabhairt san fh&iacute;or-Ghaeltacht do dhaoine nach raibh in ann Gaeilge a labhairt.  D&uacute;irt daoine go dteasta&iacute;onn daonra i gcuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus gur chuma nach raibh siad in ann Gaeilge a labhairt.  D&uacute;irt mise m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go raibh daoine le p&aacute;ist&iacute; &oacute;ga s&aacute;sta na p&aacute;ist&iacute; a chur chuig scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, gur maith an rud &eacute; sin don teanga.  Faoi dheireadh, chuir muid isteach rialacha go bhfuil daoine &aacute;iti&uacute;la, daoine at&aacute; ag obair sa cheantar n&oacute; daoine a bh&iacute; ag teacht ar ais chuig an cheantar in ann cead plean&aacute;la a fh&aacute;il gan Ghaeilge.  Bh&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht dhian againn ar an chomhairle chontae, agus sin a ch&eacute;ad uair a chuir m&eacute; f&eacute;in suim sa teanga, c&eacute; nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam.  Bh&iacute; turas agam ina dhiaidh sin chuig formh&oacute;r na n-&aacute;iteanna seo sa toghch&aacute;n &aacute;iti&uacute;il in 2009 agus rinne m&eacute; iarracht an teanga a fhoghlaim.  Bh&iacute; fadhb mh&oacute;r agam leis an Ghaeilge - muin&iacute;n.  Is fadhb &iacute; sin a bh&iacute;onn ag a l&aacute;n daoine, n&iacute;l muin&iacute;n ag a l&aacute;n daoine sa Ghaeilge agus n&iacute;l siad s&aacute;sta &iacute; a labhairt cionn is nach bhfuil siad fl&uacute;irseach agus is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Bhille seo.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil Teachta le Gaeilge ina Aire St&aacute;it don Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil gr&aacute; ag an Teachta McGinley don teanga agus go bhfuil an-d&iacute;oma air faoin titim i gcaighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Caithfimid rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh chun an teanga a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il agus is c&eacute;im sa phr&oacute;iseas sin &iacute; an Bille seo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
        <P>Nach deas an rud &eacute; go bhfuilimid in ann an Ghaeilge a chloiste&aacute;il go h&eacute;irimi&uacute;il sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht?  Gabhaim comhghairdeas don Aire St&aacute;it as sin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute;im f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och seans a bheith agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Bhille na Gaeltachta 2012.  Tar &eacute;is &eacute;isteacht leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sa Seanad agus sa D&aacute;il, is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil suim amh&aacute;in ag an Aire St&aacute;it san &aacute;bhar seo, t&aacute; gr&aacute; aige san &aacute;bhar.  T&aacute; an gr&aacute; sin, agus an nasc ag an Aire St&aacute;it lena theanga dh&uacute;chais measctha sa Bhille seo.</P>
        <P>Tar &eacute;is na mblianta agus &eacute; ina urlabhra&iacute; Ghaeltachta ar son Fhine Gael, t&aacute; s&eacute; ina Aire St&aacute;it chun an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair an T&iacute;, su&iacute;omh ina bhfuil deis aige d&oacute;chas a thabhairt ar ais do na daoine ar a bhfuil imn&iacute; faoi thodhcha&iacute; na teanga ina dhiaidh bheith ag &eacute;isteacht le gealltanais gan toradh.  D&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin, gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire St&aacute;it, n&iacute; amh&aacute;in faoin Bhille seo ach tar &eacute;is gach rud at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige ar feadh 30 bliain anuas ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mhuintir na n-oile&aacute;n agus, go h&aacute;irithe, ar son thodhcha&iacute; na teanga.</P>
        <P>Seo an ch&eacute;ad pr&iacute;omhathr&uacute; sa dl&iacute; ar &aacute;bhar na Gaeltachta &oacute; 1956.  Ag an am sin bh&iacute; an tUas Richard Mulcahy ina Aire Talmha&iacute;ochta agus thug s&eacute; Bille os comhair na D&aacute;la a bhunaigh Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis an reachta&iacute;ocht, n&iacute; as ceantar Ghaeltachta m&eacute; ach t&aacute; an-suim agam i mo theanga dh&uacute;chais.  Th&aacute;inig an tsuim seo &oacute;n am a chaith m&eacute; ag traen&aacute;il le bheith i mo mh&uacute;inteoir bunscoile, agus m&eacute; i mo mhac l&eacute;inn i gCol&aacute;iste Muire gan Sm&aacute;l i Luimneach.  Cos&uacute;il le roinnt daoine, agus iad ina 30&iacute;, bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge beagnach caillte agam.  Sula ndeachaigh m&eacute; chuig Muire gan Sm&aacute;l, chuaigh m&eacute; chuig Ollscoil Luimnigh chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; cumars&aacute;ide a bhaint amach.  Sa ch&uacute;rsa sin, bh&iacute; tuismitheoir&iacute; &oacute;ga ag d&eacute;anamh iarracht an teanga a athfhoghlaim chun cabhair a thabhairt do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; sa bhaile.  Tuismitheoir&iacute; &oacute;n mhe&aacute;n-oirthear iad a chaith suas le 13 bliain ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar scoil.  Ag an am nuair a bh&iacute; a ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile tar &eacute;is tos&uacute; sa bhunscoil, n&iacute; raibh siad in ann comhr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh leis na p&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Sin an t-am nuair a bhuail s&eacute; m&eacute; go raibh an-chuid fadhbanna sna modhanna m&uacute;inteoireachta at&aacute; againn sa Ghaeilge agus nuair a thug m&eacute; faoi deara nach bhfuil deiseanna r&eacute;ala&iacute;ocha don chuid is m&oacute; den daonra &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>D&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin, agus m&eacute; ag smaoineamh faoin mBille seo i rith na seachtaine, chuir m&eacute; ceist orm f&eacute;in an bhfuil aon ionadh ann mura nd&eacute;antar gn&iacute;omh pr&aacute;inneach nach mbeidh f&aacute;gtha ag an Ghaeilge ach 15 do 20 bliain mar theanga phobail agus theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an r&aacute;iteas sin scanr&uacute;il go leor mar mura nd&eacute;anaimid go l&eacute;ir &aacute;r nd&iacute;cheall ar son &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais beidh an Gaeilge marbh i gceann 20 bliain, agus n&iacute; bheidh inti ach teanga acad&uacute;il.  Sin &eacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil m&eacute; ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don Bhille seo.  N&iacute;lim buartha in aon n&oacute;s faoin easpa toghch&aacute;n don &uacute;dar&aacute;s, n&oacute; faoin m&eacute;id airgid a bheidh ar f&aacute;il do na daoine a bheidh ar an mbord.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; buartha faoi fheidhmeanna an &uacute;dar&aacute;is, mar t&aacute; roinnt Teachta&iacute; sa Teach seo, &oacute; na d&aacute;ilcheantair ina bhfuil Gaeltachta&iacute;, Teachta a bhfuil an t-&aacute;dh acu seasamh sa toghch&aacute;n d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Inseoidh m&eacute; rud amh&aacute;in faoin &uacute;dar&aacute;s, &aacute;fach.  Ba ch&oacute;ir do gach Roinn, gach &uacute;dar&aacute;s poibl&iacute; agus gach feidhmeannach St&aacute;it i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh don phobal le n&iacute;os l&uacute; airgid n&aacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; ar f&aacute;il go dt&iacute; seo.</P>
        <P>Ar an bpointe seo, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil an tAire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il ag &eacute;isteacht leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus ag amharc ar an mBille agus ag ullmh&uacute; leasuithe sa reachta&iacute;ocht don rialtas &aacute;iti&uacute;il ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Imp&iacute;m ar an Aire obair a dh&eacute;anamh leis na hAir&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna, ar an &aacute;bhar sin mar n&iacute; silver bullet don teanga &eacute; an Bille seo.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; i dtosach, tar &eacute;is 13 bliain, ag foghlaim na Gaeilge, bh&iacute; s&iacute; beagnach caillte agam agus mura nd&eacute;anaimid go l&eacute;ir iarracht chun an taoide sin a athr&uacute;, beidh an teanga f&oacute;s i mbaol.  N&iacute; purist m&eacute; in aon ch&oacute;r ach is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agam, agus n&iacute;l an Ghaeilge chomh l&aacute;idir agam i gcompar&aacute;id le mo chomhghleacaithe Gaeltachta, gur c&uacute;is bhr&oacute;id dom bheith in ann seasamh sa Pharlaimint n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta chun na focail seo a r&aacute; i mo theanga dh&uacute;chais.  Sa mh&eacute;id ama a bheidh an t-&aacute;dh agam bheith i mo Theachta D&aacute;la ar son mhuintir Luimnigh, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh deiseanna eile an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.</P>
        <P>Gabhaim comhghairdeas don Aire St&aacute;it agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an t-&aacute;dh leis.</P>

        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus an deis c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an mBille thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;sl&uacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it faoin bhfuinneamh at&aacute; l&eacute;irithe aige &oacute; ghlac s&eacute; a oifig.  T&aacute; iarrachta&iacute; lean&uacute;nacha a dh&eacute;anamh aige chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  </P>
        <P>I acknowledge the passion, energy and commitment the Minister of State has shown for the language since he assumed office a little more than a year ago.  There is no denying that the language is in decline, particularly in certain parts of the country.  The Minister of State has an opportunity and a responsibility to pursue a course which will revive the language.  It is an opportunity that might not present itself to future Ministers with responsibility for the Gaeltacht.  Since the Minister of State took office he has assumed this role with vigour and enthusiasm at a time when we find our language at a crossroads.</P>
        <P>There has been a discernible reduction in the use of the Irish in designated Gaeltacht areas.  Without the Minister of State&rsquo;s urgent intervention at this point, we are facing the prospect of its substantive extinction as a community and household language within the next 20 years.  His commitment has manifested itself through this Bill and it represents a final opportunity to rescue the language and reinvigorate its use.</P>
        <P>To turn to some important aspects of the Bill, it provides for a geographical redefinition of the Gaeltacht.  It is only right that in the increasingly globalised world in which we live that geographic boundaries should no longer define where our language is promoted, where it should thrive and where our efforts in nurturing, encouraging and developing its use should be focused.</P>
        <P>By defining Gaeltacht areas and narrowing our focus on these limited corners of the country we are merely consigning the language to quarantine where it will await its ultimate extinction.  Instead, this Bill provides for Gaeltacht language planning areas which will service towns in the vicinity and will be responsible for the statutory preparation of language plans.  It also provides for the designation of language networks in communities outside of Gaeltacht areas, areas within which the use of the language can be fostered and developed.  This is a welcome addition and inclusion in the Bill.  I would like to see the establishment of some of these language networks in areas of Galway city within which there is a strong pre-existing tradition of use of the language.  One such community is Knocknacarra where the language is very much alive and well, thanks in no small part to the contribution made by the local national school, Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh, which has its own challenges at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianWalsh"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Walsh</NameTxt>

        <P>Yes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianWalsh"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Walsh</NameTxt>
        <P>The Bill also amends the functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and radically alters the way in which its composition is derived.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in opposition has been jumping up and down about this Bill but there is no member of that party present in Chamber.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was here earlier.  The members of that party made a song and dance about the way this Bill is being put through the D&aacute;il and Seanad but they are not here to contribute to the debate.  Perhaps one of the reasons they are so vehement in their opposition to the Bill is that it takes politics out of the institution which is tasked with promoting the Irish language, and that is right and proper.  There is such an important function that it should transcend the political divide.  Members of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will no longer be directly elected by Gaeltacht communities.  Instead they will be appointed by the local authorities and the Minister will also have responsibility to appoint a number of members.  This will facilitate the appointment of members with an acute expertise in language development that will be important in the onerous task we have of reviving the language.  I have a little more to say but I note the Acting Chairman is signalling that I should conclude.</P>

        <P>T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; le ghn&iacute;omh&uacute; an-l&aacute;idir maidir le staid na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha agus staid na Gaeltachta mar &aacute;it a bheidh l&aacute;n de dhaoine gur f&eacute;idir leo an Ghaeilge a labhairt go laeth&uacute;il mar ghn&aacute;ththeanga.  T&aacute; s&eacute; scanr&uacute;il, mar a l&eacute;irigh an staid&eacute;ar chuimsitheach teangeola&iacute;ochta ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil aistri&uacute; suntasach &oacute; Ghaeilge go B&eacute;arla tar &eacute;is tarl&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go bhfuil na tortha&iacute; sin f&iacute;or, os rud &eacute; go bhfuil an aistri&uacute; sin le chlos.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute; le fada.  Is &eacute; an rud a screadann an staid&eacute;ar seo amach n&aacute; nach mbeidh ach 15 n&oacute; 20 bliain ag an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail agus theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Caithfear bheith l&aacute;n-d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin dains&eacute;ar &uacute;d.  Luaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v gur d&uacute;radh 150 bliain &oacute; shin go mbeadh deireadh leis an nGaeilge de bharr br&uacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta agus imirce, srl., agus n&aacute;r tharla s&eacute;.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an br&uacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os g&eacute;ire anois, &aacute;fach.  T&aacute; br&uacute; cult&uacute;rtha ar an teanga, mar shampla.  Is tr&iacute;d an iliomad me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide - an chuid is m&oacute; d&oacute;ibh i mB&eacute;arla - a bhfaigheann daoine &oacute;ga na Gaeltachta a gcuid eolais agus a th&eacute;ann siad i dteagmh&aacute;il le ghn&eacute;ithe an tsaoil mh&oacute;r a bhaineann lena saoil f&eacute;in.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, caithfear bheith l&aacute;n-d&aacute;ir&iacute;re i dtaobh an bhr&uacute; faoina bhfuil an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; cinnte, faraoir, go bhfuil teangacha caillte agus &aacute; gcailli&uacute;nt f&oacute;s ar fud an domhain, d&iacute;reach mar at&aacute; planda&iacute; luachmara &aacute; dh&iacute;oth&uacute; i bhforaoiseacha an domhain.  Is f&eacute;idir nasc a dh&eacute;anamh idir an br&uacute; at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar an teanga agus an br&uacute; at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar an bpl&aacute;in&eacute;ad ar a mhairimid.</P>
        <P>N&iacute; inniu n&aacute; inn&eacute; a th&aacute;inig an g&eacute;arch&eacute;im seo chun cinn.  T&aacute; b&aacute;n&uacute; na Gaeltachta ag tarl&uacute; le fada an l&aacute;.  Chuir an imirce, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r, isteach ar an nGaeltacht, ar phobal na Gaeltachta agus ar phobal labhartha na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; an imirce mar fhadhb againn &oacute;n nGorta M&oacute;r, ar nd&oacute;igh.  San aois deireanach, bh&iacute; ar dhaoine &oacute;ga na Gaeltachta &oacute; Dh&uacute;n na nGall, Conamara agus Ciarra&iacute; dul thar lear sna tr&iacute;ochaid&iacute;, daichid&iacute;, caogaid&iacute; agus fi&uacute; na seascaid&iacute; chun postanna a fh&aacute;il.  Mar ghas&uacute;ir &oacute;g sna seascaid&iacute;, is cuimhin liom go mbeadh na busanna ag fanacht ar na crosb&oacute;ithre nuair a bh&iacute; an f&oacute;mhar bailithe isteach agus obair an tsamhraidh d&eacute;anta chun daoine &oacute;ga a th&oacute;gaint go dt&iacute; na b&aacute;id a th&oacute;gfadh iad go Sasana.  Th&aacute;inig an rud c&eacute;anna ar ais i rith g&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta na n-ocht&oacute;id&iacute;.  Faraoir, t&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna ann anois i saol na ndaoine de bharr na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime eacnama&iacute;ochta agus de bharr an pholasa&iacute; dian, gealltach na fiacha lofa a bh&iacute; ag bancanna m&oacute;ra agus lucht sp&eacute;acl&aacute;ireachta a &iacute;oc.  Fiacha iad seo nach raibh baint ag muintir na t&iacute;re leo.  Cuireann &iacute;oc na bhfiacha seo isteach ar gheilleagar agus eacnama&iacute;ocht na t&iacute;re agus is &iacute; an d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ocht ceann de na fadhbanna is m&oacute; d&aacute; bharr.  T&aacute; an d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ocht ag cur isteach go m&oacute;r ar ghach ceann de na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, is iad g&eacute;arch&eacute;im chaipitleachais an lae inniu agus na fadhbanna eacnama&iacute;ochta a leanann &eacute; bun fr&eacute;amh an-chuid den bhr&uacute; nua at&aacute; ar na Gaeltachta&iacute; anois, go bhfuil ar na daoine &oacute;ga imeacht uathu - agus t&aacute; an teanga ag imeacht leo.  T&aacute; sin n&aacute;ireach agus dains&eacute;arach, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r don Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>Mar a d&uacute;radh cheana, t&aacute; an br&uacute; cult&uacute;rtha ar an Ghaeilge agus ar an Ghaeltacht ag treisi&uacute; in aghaidh an lae.  De bharr sin, t&aacute; gn&iacute;omh dearfach l&aacute;idir ag teast&aacute;il.  Ach an bhfuil sin sa Bhille seo?  Caithfear a r&aacute; go bhfuil d&iacute;om&aacute; ar an-chuid daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Cuireann siad f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r roimh an Bhille toisc go bhfuil Bille ann agus go bhfuil d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar si&uacute;l agus go bhfuil staid&eacute;ar d&eacute;anta, ach ba mhaith leo n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta faoi chuid de na pleananna at&aacute; &aacute; chur chun cinn i dtreo agus go mbeidh Bille agus Acht d&aacute; r&eacute;ir n&iacute;os fearr maidir le ceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; g&aacute; freisin na fadhbanna a nochtadh d&uacute;inn ag daoine go bhfuil suim acu sa sc&eacute;al seo a phl&eacute;, mar shampla, n&aacute;r deineadh aon athbhreithni&uacute; ar theorainneacha na Gaeltachta &oacute; na teorainneacha a leagadh s&iacute;os i 1956.  N&rsquo;fheadar c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil sin amhlaidh, mar cinnte t&aacute; leath den daonra at&aacute; ag maireacht&aacute;il sna Gaeltachta&iacute; anois nach bhfuil Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt acu.  T&aacute; an t-athr&uacute; m&oacute;r a l&eacute;irigh an staid&eacute;ar le 50 bliain anuas le feice&aacute;il taobh istigh de sean teorainneacha na Gaeltachta.  I mo thuairim, ba cheart teorainneacha nua r&eacute;ad&uacute;la a leagaint s&iacute;os ionas go mbeadh f&iacute;or Ghaeltachta&iacute; againn ina mbeadh tromlach na ndaoine ag labhairt Gaeilge mar theanga laeth&uacute;il.  Cuirfeadh sin dl&uacute;s leis na Gaeltachta&iacute; maidir le gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ocht iontu.  Aon maoini&uacute; n&aacute; aon acmhainn&iacute; a bheadh &aacute; chur isteach, ba cheart go mbeadh dl&uacute;s leo agus na h&aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge l&aacute;idir f&oacute;s chun &iacute; a choime&aacute;d beo iontu.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis na limist&eacute;ir plean&aacute;la teanga Gaeltachta, i bprionsabal, m&aacute;s rud e go dtugann siad sin cumhacht do ghn&aacute;th daoine agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh ionada&iacute;ochta ar ghn&aacute;th daoine chun an teanga a chur chun cinn mar teanga laeth&uacute;il, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh sin.  Ach t&aacute; imn&iacute; ar dhaoine maidir leis an maoini&uacute; agus an chabhair agus na hacmhainn&iacute; a bheidh le f&aacute;il ag na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; plean&aacute;la.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh acmhainn&iacute; agus maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Muna mbeidh, n&iacute; bheidh siad in ann an obair chu&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh. Is ceist an-th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; an cheist i dtaobh maoini&uacute; na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute; cheart go mbeadh na Gaeltachta&iacute; agus na pleananna nua seo th&iacute;os de bharr na g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime eacnama&iacute;ochta agus na ciorruithe at&aacute; &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm maidir leis an gcaiteachas poibl&iacute;, faoi mar at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, caithfidh an tAire agus an Rialtas na point&iacute; sin a ard&uacute; agus caithfidh siad a bheith d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi na hacmhainn&iacute; agus an chabhair a chaithfear a thabhairt.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; gn&iacute;omh l&aacute;idir ag teast&aacute;il chomh maith, n&iacute; amh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus m&oacute;r thimpeall na t&iacute;re.  T&aacute; an-chuid at&aacute; dearfach faoin mh&eacute;id at&aacute; tar &eacute;is tarl&uacute; le 20 n&oacute; 30 bliain anuas.  N&iacute;l aon dabht ach gur tugadh acmhainn do na Gaelscoileanna at&aacute; anois ar fud na t&iacute;re, sna cathracha agus sna bailte agus go bhfuil gl&uacute;in daoine a chuaigh tr&iacute;d na Gaelscoileanna sin sna fichid&iacute; agus n&iacute;os sine agus go labhra&iacute;onn siad f&oacute;s an Ghaeilge.  Mar shampla, labhra&iacute;onn siad liomsa &iacute; nuair a bhuaileann siad liom.  T&aacute; gl&uacute;in &oacute;g, d&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; agus a leith&eacute;id, ann anois go bhfuil an-chumas acu maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; an-ghr&aacute; acu don Ghaeilge agus teasta&iacute;onn uathu go mbeadh an teanga in &uacute;s&aacute;id acu ina saol laeth&uacute;il.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, n&iacute; thiocfaidh an Ghaeilge thar nais mar phr&iacute;omh teanga labhartha na t&iacute;re seo ariamh agus caithfimid a bheith r&eacute;ad&uacute;il faoi sin.  Ach an rud at&aacute; uainn agus go gcaithfear a chur i gcr&iacute;ch n&aacute; go mbeidh an Ghaeilge i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ann mar theanga ar chomh-leibh&eacute;al.  &Oacute; thaobh daonra labhartha, caithfear teanga l&aacute;idir a bheith againn agus caithfidh bu&iacute;on an-l&aacute;idir de dhaoine m&oacute;r thimpeall na t&iacute;re a bheith in ann gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ionas go mbeidh t&iacute;r dh&aacute; theangach againn i gc&oacute;na&iacute; mar thodhca&iacute;.  Tubaiste agus trag&oacute;id a bheadh ann d&aacute; gcaillf&iacute; an teanga.  Caithfimid cuimhneamh ar na gl&uacute;inte at&aacute; f&oacute;s le teacht.  Muna mbeidh an Ghaeilge beo c&eacute;ad bhliain &oacute; inniu, beidh s&eacute; deacair do dhaoine a t&iacute;r f&eacute;in a thuiscint, fi&uacute; rud chomh simpl&iacute; le logainmneacha.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go dtabharfar chomh maith taca&iacute;ocht don teanga taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Maidir le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus maidir leis an gcaoi go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it ag bascadh toghch&aacute;n d&iacute;reacha don &uacute;dar&aacute;s, is c&eacute;im siar &iacute; sin.  Is buille don daonlathas agus do dhaonlathas muintir na Gaeltachta &eacute; an cinneadh seo.  Measaim n&aacute;r cheart dul ar aghaidh leis.  De r&eacute;ir uachtar&aacute;n Conradh na Gaeilge:</P>
        <P LI="1">An bhuairt eile at&aacute; ar Chonradh na Gaeilge n&aacute; nach mbeidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ionada&iacute;och ar an bpobal ar a fhreastala&iacute;onn s&eacute; air a thuilleadh, de r&eacute;ir mar a sheasann c&uacute;rsa&iacute; faoin mBille Gaeltachta faoi l&aacute;thair agus uireasa toghch&aacute;n poibl&iacute; ann do chomhalta&iacute; Bhord an &Uacute;dar&aacute;is.

        <P FLI="0">C&eacute;im siar is ea &eacute; seo.  N&rsquo;fheadar c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it agus an Rialtas ag dul s&iacute;os an b&oacute;thar seo.  N&iacute; ghlacaim leis, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, gur costas at&aacute; i gceist mar n&iacute; f&eacute;idir praghas a chur ar an daonlathas.

Is cinnte go gcaithfear an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s a athr&uacute; chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os fearr agus n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute;, ach ba cheart an daonlathas a choime&aacute;d ag an am c&eacute;anna.</P>
        <P>Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta chun todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a phl&eacute;.  M&aacute; leanann an g&eacute;arch&eacute;im seo ar aghaidh ar feadh na blianta fada, tiocfaidh dl&uacute;s n&iacute;os m&oacute; f&oacute;s ar an mbr&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; chur ar an nGaeltacht i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  T&aacute; an-d&aacute;ins&eacute;ar ag baint leis an ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta agus ag teacht as na polasaithe d&eacute;ine agus ciorraithe at&aacute; &aacute; gcur i gcr&iacute;ch ag an Rialtas seo, d&iacute;reach mar an Rialtas deireanach.  T&aacute; na daoine &oacute;ga &aacute; thiom&aacute;int amach as na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Beidh an fadhb n&iacute;os measa f&oacute;s m&aacute; leanann an c&uacute;l&uacute; ar aghaidh.  Bh&iacute; smaoint&iacute; radacacha agus s&oacute;isiala&iacute; an-l&aacute;idir sna Gaeltachta&iacute; ag amanna difri&uacute;la.  Sna seascaid&iacute; agus ag t&uacute;s na seacht&oacute;id&iacute;, mar shampla, bh&iacute; an-taca&iacute;ocht i measc cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge do smaoint&iacute; &oacute;n eite chl&eacute;, an s&oacute;isialachas agus a leith&eacute;id.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag teast&aacute;il ar&iacute;s.</P>
        <P>Caithfear c&uacute;rsa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta a athr&uacute; bun os cionn agus deireadh a chur leis an gc&oacute;ras lofa at&aacute; ag tabhairt an oiread sin g&eacute;arch&eacute;ime do ghn&aacute;thdhaoine agus ag b&aacute;n&uacute; pobail m&oacute;rthimpeall na t&iacute;re, na Gaeltachta&iacute; ina measc.

Sa ch&aacute;s sin, bheadh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; geallagair agus eacnama&iacute;ochta faoi bhl&aacute;th agus d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh an ghl&uacute;in &oacute;g a bh&iacute; orthu imeacht teacht ar ais go dt&iacute; a n-&aacute;iteanna d&uacute;chais.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir labhairt faoi todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta gan labhairt faoin gcomhth&eacute;acs eacnama&iacute;ochta agus - m&oacute;r an trua - faoin ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta agus na polasaithe d&eacute;ine at&aacute; ag cur isteach chomh m&oacute;r agus ag d&eacute;anamh an oiread sin dam&aacute;iste don t&iacute;r agus do mhuintir na t&iacute;re agus muintir na Gaeltachta, an ghl&uacute;in &oacute;g go coitianta.</P>

        <P>Ba mhaith liom an obair at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an Aire St&aacute;it a mholadh.  Gu&iacute;m gach r&aacute;th air leis an mBille seo.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn ar fad go gcabhr&oacute;idh s&eacute; len&aacute;r dteanga a chaomhn&uacute; agus a neart&uacute; amach anseo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an Bille seo ar &uacute;rl&aacute;r na D&aacute;la.  Is oth liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil an Ghaeilge, cos&uacute;il le formh&oacute;r teangacha d&uacute;chasacha an domhain, i mbaol a b&aacute;is.  Is mar sin a bh&iacute; s&eacute; &oacute; th&uacute;s an 20&uacute; aois.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le &eacute;inne praghas a chur ar th&aacute;bhacht agus fi&uacute;ntas &aacute;r dteanga.  T&aacute; focail agus nathanna cainte speisialta ag baint le haon teanga.  T&aacute; litr&iacute;ocht aonarach ag baint leis na seanfhocail, na modhanna smaointe, na logainmneacha agus a leith&eacute;id.  T&aacute;imid i mbaol iad a chailli&uacute;nt go deo.  Is c&uacute;is bhr&oacute;in &eacute; sin dom agus don domhan ar fad.  M&aacute; chailleann muid an Ghaeilge, cailli&uacute;nt a bheidh ann don t&iacute;r ar fad.

M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun &aacute;r n-oidhreacht a choime&aacute;d beo, caithfimid s&aacute;r-obair a dh&eacute;anamh ar son na Gaeilge.  Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n achoimre ar an mBille seo go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar leaba a b&aacute;is fi&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart do gach l&aacute;mh den St&aacute;t i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun seans a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge nuair at&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, le docht&uacute;ir&iacute; n&oacute; na garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta le halt 11 na Bille seo, a bhaineann le l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun an Ghaeilge a choime&aacute;d beo, caithfimid gach spreagadh a thabhairt di sa Ghalltacht, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r sna cathracha agus sna bailte.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil alt 11 chomh t&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute; obair den scoth d&eacute;anta ag daoine agus gr&uacute;pa&iacute; ar son an teanga i roinnt &aacute;iteanna ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Bhuna&iacute;odar bunscoileanna agus meanscoileanna as a stuaim f&eacute;in.  Buna&iacute;odh eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; chun an Ghaeilge agus gach gn&eacute; de chult&uacute;r na h&Eacute;ireann a chur chun cinn.  T&aacute; m&eacute; i mo ch&oacute;na&iacute; i gceann de na ceantair sin, Cluain Dolc&aacute;in i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  T&aacute; gr&uacute;pa Muintir Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in ag cur an Ghaeilge chun cinn le nach m&oacute;r 40 bliain.  T&aacute; nach m&oacute;r deich scoileanna bunaithe timpeall an cheantair agus, mar aschur as sin, t&aacute; an Ghaeilge curtha ar f&aacute;il do na m&iacute;lte p&aacute;ist&iacute;, roinnt de mo fhoireann ina measc.  B&iacute;onn caint, ceol agus rince Gaelach ar si&uacute;l sa l&aacute;rionad th&iacute;os in &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, th&aacute;inig s&eacute; seo ar fad as an obair iontach a rinne gr&uacute;pa beag de ghn&aacute;thdhaoine a raibh suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Ba cheart st&aacute;das speisialta a thabhairt d&rsquo;&aacute;iteanna mar seo mar at&aacute; i gceist faoi alt 11.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfu&iacute;l bailte &eacute;ags&uacute;la eile - Ceatharlach agus Inis, mar shampla - cos&uacute;il le Cluain Dolc&aacute;in.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ceart go bhfuil s&eacute; scr&iacute;ofa sa Bhille go mbeidh ar &aacute;iteanna cos&uacute;il le Cluain Dolc&aacute;in pleananna a dh&eacute;anamh chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.</P>
        <P>C&eacute; go bhfuil t&uacute;s maith d&eacute;anta againn, caithfear misni&uacute; agus br&uacute; a chur ar dhaoine an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.</P>

Ba ch&oacute;ir don Rialtas spreagadh a thabhairt do aon ghr&uacute;pa a bhfuil suim aige sa Ghaeilge.  I mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, mar shampla, t&aacute; club &uacute;rnua de chuid Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael ina labhrann na baill lena ch&eacute;ile i nGaeilge amh&aacute;in.

        <P>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt ar an mBille seo.  Is Bille t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; don Ghaeltacht agus dos na m&iacute;lte cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as an obair a rinne s&eacute; ar an mBille agus as freastal ar na cruinnithe go l&eacute;ir inar deineadh an Bille a phl&eacute;.  N&iacute;l dabht ar bith faoin tiom&aacute;ntas at&aacute; aige don Ghaeilge, don Ghaeltacht agus don phost th&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; aige.</P>
        <P>Is on&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r dom bheith i mo ionada&iacute; don Ghaeltacht is m&oacute; sa t&iacute;r, ina bhfuil na Forbacha, Indreabh&aacute;n, Ceantar na n-Oile&aacute;n agus Ros a&rsquo; Mhich&iacute;l, agus l&aacute;r na cathrach i nGaillimh chomh maith.  Is &iacute; an teanga a chuireann leis an gculr&uacute;r saibhir at&aacute; le feice&aacute;il i nGaillimh agus is cathair dh&aacute;-theangach &iacute;, rud a bhfuilimid an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as.  N&aacute;rbh iontach an rud cult&uacute;r na Gaeltachta a fheice&aacute;il ar fud na cathrach i rith an Volvo Ocean Race an tseachtain seo caite, leis na curacha agus b&aacute;id tradisi&uacute;nta in &eacute;ineacht leis na luaimh m&oacute;ra &oacute; gach aird den domhan?</P>
        <P>T&aacute; an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in do thodhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta, ach do thodhcha&iacute; na teanga fresin.  Cuireann s&eacute; pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga le ch&eacute;ile a leanann &oacute;n strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Beidh plean teanga &eacute;ags&uacute;il ag gach comhluadar agus t&aacute; 19 gcomhluadar ina n-ioml&aacute;n.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; cheann i nGaillimh, na Forbacha-Ros a&rsquo; Mhich&iacute;l agus An Cheathr&uacute; Rua-Ceantar na n-Oile&aacute;n.  Beidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus na comhluchta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la Gaeilge i ngach ceantar freagrach as an strat&eacute;is a chur infeidhm.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an bpr&oacute;iseas sin.</P>
        <P>There has been consternation in some circles over the change in the authority and composition of the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Sometimes an attempt is made to isolate the Gaeltacht rather than to view Irish as a phenomenon that is part of the entire country.  If one creates an authority that looks after the Gaeltacht alone and separates it from the language, one creates pockets of Irishness and of the Irish language as opposed to regarding the language as a part of everybody&rsquo;s culture throughout the country.</P>
        <P>To have the newly composed board looking after the development of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht with the plans and to have Foras na Gaeilge working outside the Gaeltacht with a similar objective creates a much more broad strategy for the Irish language than the strategy simply saying a certain pocket must survive.  It is a question of saying we must protect what we have and also develop and expand.  The new structure of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which entails working with Foras na Gaeilge as the North-South body, is very much to be welcomed and endorsed.</P>
        <P>I am glad the enterprise function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is being maintained to the extent that it will work and share resources with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  The latter bodies are experts in this regard.  It has been shown that they can work very well together.  It was announced that Mylan is to create hundreds of new jobs in the Gaeltacht.  This project was worked on by the IDA in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  This represents very good and efficient use of resources.</P>
        <P>The Irish language is a beautiful cultural asset and makes Ireland different from the rest of the world.  The language, in itself, is an expression of difference.  This is evident in the Gaeltacht, where there are different traditions and sayings and different ways of doing things and thinking.  The language is a verbal expression of a difference in culture and it is extremely important that we maintain it.</P>
        <P>Sometimes the institutional way in which we deal with the Irish language, as in the education system, is such that the language is just seen as one of words.  This approach to teaching the language to young people in the education system and bodies of State turns people off.  It is just a different way of saying the same thing.  We should be saying Irish is a different language with a different culture and that it is associated with a different sense of Irishness that one can access and participate in, thus making oneself and society richer.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  It presents a great opportunity to develop the Irish language and maintain it in the Gaeltacht areas.  It should be maintained, given space to develop and expand.  We must look beyond the Gaeltacht to create Irish language strategies in every community.  The Gaeltacht movement, from the Gaeltacht schools to those who have developed an interest in the language, is going from strength to strength.  There is a great future for the language and this legislation is one step along the way.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree there is definitely space for a broader debate on Str&aacute;it&eacute;is 20 Bliain and other measures we can take to encourage and protect Irish and look after the communities for whom it is the first language.  The unique pockets of culture and identity should be protected.</P>

        <P>N&iacute;l aon recipes agam ach leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh ar aon n&oacute;s.  T&aacute; an &aacute;thas orm seans chun labhairt ar an mBille.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; nach bhfuil m&eacute; chomh l&iacute;ofa is a bh&iacute; m&eacute; nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag freastal ar an mhe&aacute;nscoil.  Throughout the debate, it has been said that when people leave school, they no longer feel the same onus is on them to speak the language.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag freastal ar ollscoil na Gaillimhe agus bh&iacute; seans agam an d&iacute;opl&oacute;ma sa Ghaeilge a dh&eacute;anamh.  It stopped there I am afraid.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute;, ach leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh ar aon n&oacute;s.</P>
        <P>We need to look back and remember where we were.  Under the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration, there was prolonged speculation as to what would happen with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  There was talk of abolition or, if not abolition, serious, if not radical, dilution.  The McCarthy report recommended the transfer of the agency&rsquo;s enterprise development remit within the Gaeltacht to Enterprise Ireland.  In any event, the former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, had overseen an 80% reduction in the capital budget of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta by comparison with the 14% reduction in the case of Enterprise Ireland.  It is worth remembering the position we were in.</P>
        <P>The remit of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, as it was to become under Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s interpretation of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, was to cover the whole country, a proposal that did not bode well for small Gaeltacht communities, such as An Rinn agus An Sean Phobal i bPort L&aacute;irge.  The election of a new board for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, due in 2010, was postponed indefinitely and the filling of the agency&rsquo;s CEO position was also put on hold.  The current Government acted decisively to secure the agency&rsquo;s role as an economic and social development agency in the Gaeltacht areas of seven counties, including An Rinn and An Sean Phobal.  The Minister of State is to be commended on his work.</P>
        <P>Beginning with the Government&rsquo;s decision on 31 May 2011 and supplemented by recent developments, the Minister of State has been able to confirm that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will, in addition to its important and enhanced cultural and social roles, continue as a business support and enterprise promotion agency in An Rinn, An Seana Phobal and designated parts of six other counties.  It is right that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will do this in co-operation with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  That a new CEO has been appointed at &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is welcome and arrangements are proceeding to constitute a new, reduced board.</P>
        <P>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Foras na Gaeilge will co-ordinate the promotion of the language in non-Gaeltacht areas, allowing for the possibility of service towns near Gaeltacht areas, for example, Dungarvan, to acquire special designation and support.  This should be broadly welcomed.  For a town like Dungarvan, which is both close and apart from the Gaeltacht, the proposed reforms will do much to encourage the language and the beautiful tapestry presented by Gaeilge na Mumhan and Gaeltacht na nDeise.  It is an important move for all of the citizens of Port L&aacute;irge.</P>
        <P>The definition of Gaeltacht areas will be based on local language planning, a relevant practice that is already ongoing in many communities like An Rinn agus An Seana Phobal.  Opportunities will exist for areas or language networks outside of the Gaeltacht so that the language can broaden.  As Deputy Nolan mentioned, there are pockets of enriched areas where Gaeilge is the first language, but we need to do more to broaden it.  Many of those who have been following the debate told me of their reluctance to speak the language because of the embarrassment of getting it wrong.  Everyone needs to try and to use the c&uacute;pla focal and everyday terminology, which is something I try to do with my daughter at home.  She is a great advocate for the language, long may it continue.  Her mother stopped after her leaving certificate oral examination.</P>
        <P>Small Gaeltacht areas like An Rinn agus An Seana Phobal have been important in the stimulation of employment.  Compared with other areas, we have boxed above our weight.  This is no more so than in the case of Nemeton Teo, a television production company that is going from strength to strength.  It brings the old and the new together, namely, our Irish language and digital communication.  The Setanta Sports channel is produced and broadcasted from our Gaeltacht.  The company is a major source of employment and has been able to work in partnership with Waterford Institute of Technology in delivering an educational diploma in television and radio communications, thereby bringing a new generation of people to the language in their everyday work.  This is commendable.  I hope that the Minister of State will remember this example, as small Gaeltacht areas have a large role to play.  In light of the David and Goliath position in which such areas find themselves, they often do more than others through the use of creative approaches towards promoting the language, creating employment opportunities, etc.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will visit our area this summer to open Col&aacute;iste na Mumhan, which has a long tradition of being the Gaeltacht for adults.  Perhaps I should check into it to improve my language skills during the coming months.  When the Minister of State visited An Rinn a few months ago, he saw the level of interest in the language, in job creation and in bringing together the new and the old.</P>

        <P>T&aacute; an Bille seo iontach tabhachtach.  T&aacute;imid ag labhairt faoi todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus todhcha&iacute; na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it go bhfuil an todhcha&iacute; sin i gcont&uacute;irt.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt sa t&iacute;r le n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 2,000 bliain.  Nuair a buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t, bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt ag 250,000 duine sa Ghaeltacht.  Is figi&uacute;r an-mh&oacute;r &eacute; sin.  Sna fichid&iacute; agus sna triochaid&iacute;, bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt mar teanga d&uacute;chais i gcontaetha Aontroma, Doire, an Chabh&aacute;in, Ard Mhacha, an L&uacute;, Liatroma, Shligigh, Ros Com&aacute;in, an Chl&aacute;ir, Tiobraid &Aacute;rainn agus Cill Chainnigh.  Di&uacute;ltaigh Rialtas na linne sin na molta&iacute; a rinne Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeltachta i 1926 a th&oacute;gaint san &aacute;ireamh.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn smaoineamh ar sin.  Ag an am sin, d&uacute;irt an coimisi&uacute;n gur cheart go mbeadh teagmh&aacute;il idir an St&aacute;t agus an Ghaeltacht tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  N&iacute;or t&oacute;gadh an comhairle sin.  Os rud &eacute; gur theip ar gach Rialtas &oacute; shin an taca&iacute;ocht cu&iacute; a thabhairt don Ghaeltacht, n&iacute; raibh an teagmh&aacute;il idir an St&aacute;t agus an Ghaeltacht tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>D&uacute;irt tuarasc&aacute;il a d&rsquo;fhoilsigh Bord na Gaeilge i 1987 go raibh gn&iacute;omhaireachta&iacute; riarach&aacute;in an St&aacute;it i measc na f&oacute;rsa&iacute; is cumhachta&iacute; i gceantair Gaeltachta.

B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur seo an ghl&uacute;in deireanach ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge &aacute; labhairt mar teanga d&uacute;chasach na t&iacute;re.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil 2,000 bliain ag teacht chun deiridh leis an ghl&uacute;in seo.  Mar sin, t&aacute; an-dhualgas agus an-fhreagra&iacute;ocht ar an ghl&uacute;in seo.  T&aacute; an Ghaeltacht ag meath agus ag c&uacute;ng&uacute; bliain i ndiaidh bliain.  T&aacute; daoine ag sn&aacute;mh in aghaidh an tsrutha in &aacute;iteanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  T&aacute; bac curtha ar an meath sin i gceantair difri&uacute;la.  T&aacute; borradh ag teacht ar an nGaeilge anseo is ansi&uacute;d.  Is eisceachta&iacute; iad na h&aacute;iteanna sin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; a fhios ag gach &eacute;inne go bhfuil an t-al&aacute;ram ag bualadh don Ghaeltacht.  D&rsquo;fhoilsigh an Rialtas Bille na Gaeltachta 2012 mar fhreagra ar an gceist pr&aacute;inneach seo.  Bh&iacute;omar ag feitheamh le fada.  T&aacute; 60 bliain imithe &oacute;n iarracht deireanach.  Le bliain anuas, gach uair a chuir m&eacute; ceisteanna ar an Aire St&aacute;it d&uacute;irt s&eacute; liom go raibh an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ag teacht agus thug s&eacute; go leor geall&uacute;int&iacute; faoi cad a bheadh inti.  T&aacute; an-d&iacute;oma orainn mar ph&aacute;irt&iacute; faoin mBille seo.  Os rud &eacute; go bhfuil an cheist seo chomh t&aacute;bhachtach, ba cheart go mbeadh an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ceart.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh na fadhbanna go l&eacute;ir iarn&aacute;ilte amach as an reachta&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ceart san Oireachtas riachtanach chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh an Bille seo a bhrost&uacute; roimh deireadh t&eacute;arma seo na D&aacute;la.  T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in ag iarraidh 78 leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille seo.  Is l&eacute;ir go mbeidh leasuithe breise le moladh ag na p&aacute;irtithe eile.  T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte go mbeidh orainn d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na leasuithe sin i gceann seachtain amh&aacute;in.  T&aacute; an Rialtas chun Ch&eacute;im an Choiste agus an Tuarasc&aacute;il a eagr&uacute; ar an l&aacute; c&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; sin dochreidte.  N&iacute; bheimid in an d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le ceathr&uacute; na leasuithe at&aacute; ann.  N&iacute; gear&aacute;n polaiti&uacute;il &eacute; seo, t&aacute; na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge uile ar buille go bhfuil an Rialtas ag br&uacute; na reachta&iacute;ochta seo tr&iacute;d an Oireachtas.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil br&uacute; ar an Rialtas mar t&aacute; an toghch&aacute;n do bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is ag teacht agus ba mhaith leis gach rud a r&eacute;iteach roimh an toghch&aacute;n sin.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it, &aacute;fach, gur f&eacute;idir linn an toghch&aacute;n sin a chur ar athl&oacute; go ceann bliana agus t&aacute;imid ar an taobh seo s&aacute;sta cabhr&uacute; leis an Aire St&aacute;it chun sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute; g&aacute; ach l&iacute;ne amh&aacute;in a athr&uacute; sa reachta&iacute;ocht chun sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>Beidh an Bille seo mar oidhreacht don Aire St&aacute;it.  Nach mbeadh s&eacute; go hiontach d&aacute; mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta in ann a r&aacute; go raibh an Teachta McGinley freagrach as an mborradh m&oacute;r at&aacute; ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht. Ba cheart go mbeadh daoine in ann a r&aacute; go mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it oscailte do smaointe maithe agus r&eacute;idh ruda&iacute; a athr&uacute;?  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh seo mar an seans deireanach an Ghaeltacht a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart mar sin.  M&aacute; chuireann an tAire St&aacute;it an Bille ar atr&aacute;th, n&iacute; aont&oacute;imid le gach rud ach is f&eacute;idir na fadhbanna ollmh&oacute;ra sa Bhille a r&eacute;iteach gan costas ar bith ar an St&aacute;t.  T&aacute; togra&iacute; maithe sa Bhille, n&iacute;l aon dabht faoi sin.  Aonta&iacute;m le c&uacute;pla rud at&aacute; ann sa Bhille.  N&iacute;lim ag r&aacute; go bhfuil an Bille loite ar fad. T&aacute; togra&iacute; maithe ann.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh agus an Teachta &Oacute; Dochartaigh faoi inn&eacute;, an fhadhb is m&oacute; at&aacute; ag daoine n&aacute; an easpa daonlathais.  Beidh strucht&uacute;r an &uacute;dar&aacute;is athruithe agus beidh bearna &oacute; thaobh an daonlathais ann.  N&iacute; bheidh baill an &uacute;dar&aacute;is freagrach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, beidh an nasc idir an Ghaeltacht agus an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s briste.  I gContae na M&iacute;, t&aacute; dh&aacute; Ghaeltacht ann - R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib.  As seo amach, is f&eacute;idir duine as D&uacute;n Seachlainn n&oacute; Baile Shl&aacute;ine ainmnithe mar bhall an &uacute;dar&aacute;is, duine nach mbeidh air v&oacute;ta&iacute; a lorg i R&aacute;th Chairn n&oacute; Baile Ghib agus nach mbeidh freagrach ar na daoine sin. Beidh tionchar mhuintir R&aacute;th Chairn agus Bhile Ghib laghdaithe ar fad.</P>
        <P>Bot&uacute;n eile, t&aacute; an Bille ag tabhairt neamhairde ar na blianta taighde luachmhar at&aacute; d&eacute;anta.  Caitheadh suas le &euro;0.5 milli&uacute;n ar staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach teangeola&iacute;ocht ag saineolaithe &oacute; Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge le comhghleaca&iacute;ocht &oacute; Ollscoil Mh&aacute; Nuad, inar rinneadh pl&eacute; ioml&aacute;n cuimsitheach le daoine at&aacute; ag baint le hearn&aacute;il na Gaeilge agus na nGaeltachta&iacute;.  N&iacute;l an Bille ag glacadh leis na crit&eacute;ir a bh&iacute; ann sa staid&eacute;ar.  Dar leis an staid&eacute;ar sin, t&aacute; tr&iacute; chine&aacute;l pobal teanga faoi leith laistigh de limist&eacute;ar reacht&uacute;il na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; limist&eacute;ar catag&oacute;ire A ann, na h&aacute;iteanna ina mb&iacute;onn n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 67% de na daoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il.  T&aacute; limist&eacute;ar catag&oacute;ire B ann, a chuims&iacute;onn na ceantair ina mb&iacute;onn idir 44% agus 67% faoin gc&eacute;ad de na daoine ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il agus catag&oacute;ir C, ceantair ina &uacute;s&aacute;idtear n&iacute;os l&uacute; n&aacute; 44% faoin gc&eacute;ad de na cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge an teanga ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il.  T&aacute; an Bille seo dall don eolas sin.  N&iacute;l baint strait&eacute;iseach &aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id ar an eolas sin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; an Rialtas ag iarraidh an Ghaeltacht a bhriseadh suas in 19 ceantar.  N&iacute;l cuid de na ceantair feili&uacute;nach le ch&eacute;ile.  N&iacute; ceart ceantar at&aacute; l&aacute;idir &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de a chur isteach le ceantar at&aacute; lag.  Leagann an cur chuige maidir le plean&aacute;il teanga ualach na hoibre ar eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; beaga &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  T&aacute; an sc&eacute;al n&iacute;os measa f&oacute;s.  Beidh ceantair le leibh&eacute;il dhifri&uacute;la measctha le ch&eacute;ile, a chruth&oacute;idh deacrachta&iacute; praitici&uacute;la i dtaobh plean&aacute;il teanga.  Beidh deacrachta&iacute; ann do cheantair l&aacute;idre agus do cheantair laga.  M&aacute; t&aacute; plean le hullmh&uacute; do cheantar le Gaeilge, ba cheart go mbeadh caighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge thart ar an chaighde&aacute;n c&eacute;anna sa cheantar.  N&iacute; mar sin a tharla&iacute;onn sa Bhille seo.</P>
        <P>Mar a d&uacute;irt an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, n&iacute; bheidh feidhm mar cheart le baile n&aacute; le Gaeltacht mura gcuirfear dualgas reacht&uacute;il ar eagras St&aacute;it a ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  I rith na seachtaine, chuir m&eacute; glaoch ar an ESB chun gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Roghnaigh m&eacute; chun an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  De na tr&iacute; uair a ghlaoigh m&eacute; ar an ESB, n&iacute; raibh an duine s&aacute;sta an gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agus bh&iacute; orm fanacht.  N&iacute; bheidh an gn&aacute;thdhuine &oacute;n Ghaeltacht s&aacute;sta fanacht tr&iacute; huaire chun gn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>San Oireachtas seo fi&uacute;, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh f&eacute;achaint inniu ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a tharla sa Seanad an tseachtain seo caite agus nuair a d&rsquo;amharc m&eacute; ar an Idirl&iacute;on, bh&iacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar shl&aacute;inte na n-ainmhithe le f&aacute;il, mar bh&iacute; s&eacute; i mB&eacute;arla, ach n&iacute; raibh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht faoin mBille seo thuas i nGaeilge mar bh&iacute; s&eacute; i nGaeilge.  Chuir m&eacute; glaoch ar na hoifig&iacute; agus d&uacute;radh liom nach bhfuil an fhoireann acu an m&eacute;id sin a chur suas ar an Idirl&iacute;on toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; i nGaeilge.</P>
        <P>Chuir m&eacute; ceist isteach an tseachtain seo faoi cheisteanna a cuireadh an tseachtain seo chugainn.  Th&aacute;inig duine amh&aacute;in as oifig na gceist ar ais chugam agus n&iacute; raibh s&iacute; in ann an cheist a thuiscint agus n&iacute; raibh s&iacute; in ann &eacute; a l&eacute;amh mar bh&iacute; an cheist i nGaeilge agus n&iacute; raibh Gaeilge aici.  Mura bhfuilimid in ann c&oacute;ras d&aacute;theangach a chur i bhfeidhm sa Teach seo, n&iacute; bheimid in ann c&oacute;ras d&aacute;theangach a chur i bhfeidhm i R&aacute;th Chairn, n&oacute; Gort an Choirce n&oacute; p&eacute; &aacute;it eile sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Mar a d&uacute;irt an coimisin&eacute;ir, bheadh l&uacute;b url&aacute;ir an-suntasach i bhfeidhmi&uacute; an Bhille nua Gaeltachta mura gcinnt&iacute;tear treoracha leis go gcuirf&iacute; na leasuithe at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la dualgais reacht&uacute;la ar eagrais St&aacute;it a gcuid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute; i 1926, agus 1986, d&uacute;irt na tuarasc&aacute;lacha ansin go raibh an St&aacute;t mar fh&oacute;rsa galldaithe sa Ghaeltacht. F&oacute;s n&iacute;lim in ann an teagmh&aacute;il idir an St&aacute;t agus an Ghaeltacht a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Go dt&iacute; go mbeimid in ann sin a r&eacute;iteach, laghd&oacute;far an Ghaeilge. N&iacute; bh&iacute;onn Gaeilge le f&aacute;il sna h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  N&iacute;l aon Ghaeilge le f&aacute;il &oacute; Chomhairle Bhaile na hUaimhe n&oacute; &oacute; Chomhairle Contae na M&iacute; le haghaidh mhuintir R&aacute;th Chairn n&oacute; mhuintir Bhaile Ghib.  Theip ar an Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isialta a dhualgas dleathach a l&iacute;onadh, rud a luaigh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ina thuarasc&aacute;il bhliant&uacute;il.  Is iad an Roinn Talmha&iacute;ochta, Bia agus Mara agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna na heagra&iacute;ochta poibl&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an Ghaeltacht agus n&iacute;l siad in ann a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba ch&oacute;ir an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oibre i ngach c&uacute;irt sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh daoine in ann an hGaeilge a roghn&uacute; mar theanga oibre.  D&eacute; r&eacute;ir Acht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 2005. t&aacute; ar an choimisin&eacute;ir garda&iacute; le Gaeilge a lonn&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar is eol, n&iacute;or cuireadh sin i bhfeidhm i gceantar an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in, nuair a lonna&iacute;odh garda&iacute; gan Gaeilge ann i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta.  Caithfimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na ruda&iacute; sin.</P>
        <P>Rud eile at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach anseo n&aacute; maoini&uacute; agus na hacmhainn&iacute; a bheidh ar f&aacute;il chun na ruda&iacute; seo a chur i bhfeidhm i gceart.  Nuair a bh&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ar an dtaobh seo den Teach c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, d&uacute;irt s&eacute;:</P>
        <P LI="1">Aonta&iacute;mid go l&eacute;ir go bhfuil an strait&eacute;is t&aacute;bhachtach, ach t&aacute; cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; f&oacute;s.  T&aacute; ceisteanna bun&uacute;sacha, t&aacute;bhachtacha le freagairt ag an Aire.  M&aacute; amharcann daoine ar chaiteachas na Roinne don bhliain seo agus don bhliain seo chugainn agus na blianta amach romhainn, t&aacute; titim thubaisteach ann.  In 2007, bh&iacute; &euro;112 milli&uacute;n ag an Roinn agus an bhliain seo chugainn, t&aacute; &euro;40 milli&uacute;n, beagnach an rud ad&uacute;irt an Bord Snip Nua.</P>
        <P FLI="0">An aonta&iacute;onn an tAire St&aacute;it go mbeidh s&eacute; an-deacair ar fad freagracht a ghlacadh as strait&eacute;is na Gaeilge agus as ruda&iacute; eile a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht nuair at&aacute; titim chomh tubaisteach sin ar an chaiteachas at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don Roinn don bhliain seo chugainn agus na blianta le teacht?  N&iacute;l seo dodh&eacute;anta.  T&aacute; an Rialtas ag cleasa&iacute;ocht, mar n&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist aige ach an strait&eacute;is a chur amach, ach gan &iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm.  Is iad na focail at&aacute; l&eacute;ite amach agam, focail an Aire St&aacute;it &eacute; f&eacute;in.  Ach n&aacute;ire air, t&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna ag titim amach inniu.  Mar ad&uacute;irt mo chomhleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh, sa Seanad an tseachtain seo caite, t&aacute; an cleasa&iacute;ocht c&eacute;anna ar bun ag an Aire St&aacute;it sa Bhille seo.</P>
        <P>Is l&eacute;ir gur colceathar bocht &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; fheidhmeoidh an plean gan acmhainn&iacute;, ach n&iacute;l an Rialtas in ann iad a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Ba cheart go mbeadh r&oacute;l pr&iacute;omha ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s maidir le forbairt na bpleananna seo.  Ba cheart go mbeadh teorainn ama leagtha amach chomh maith, ar eagla go leanfaidh an pr&oacute;iseas ar aghaidh gan stad.  T&aacute; fait&iacute;os orm go mbeidh an pr&oacute;iseas &aacute; reacht&aacute;il ar bhonn ad hoc, gan t&uacute;s n&aacute; deireadh.  Rud eile, cad a tharl&oacute;idh ag deireadh an phr&oacute;isis, ag am na cinni&uacute;na, maidir leis na pleananna teanga?  N&iacute;l eagra&iacute;ocht neamhsple&aacute;ch ar bith luaite sa reachta&iacute;ocht chun breithi&uacute;nas a thabhairt ar ch&eacute; chomh rath&uacute;il a bhfuil cur i bhfeidhm an phlean.  Tabharfaidh an tAire St&aacute;it a bhreithi&uacute;nas.  T&aacute; seisean ag cur an ch&oacute;rais polaiti&uacute;il i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r an phr&oacute;isis.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la ar thaobh an Rialtais agus gan amhras, beidh Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; agus comhairleoir&iacute; contae ag stocaireacht ar son a gceantar.  Beidh Air&iacute;, sa todhca&iacute;, ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il v&oacute;ta&iacute; san &aacute;ireamh agus iad ag tabhairt bhreithi&uacute;nais ar phleananna teanga.  C&oacute;ras claonta a bheidh i gceist.  Cad iad na crit&eacute;ir a &uacute;s&aacute;idfear amach anseo.  N&iacute; fios d&uacute;inne, mar n&iacute;l na crit&eacute;ir leagtha amach sa Bhille.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte nach bhfuil aon phr&oacute;iseas achomhairc l&eacute;irithe sa Bhille.  M&aacute; theipeann ar cheantar le plean, sin &eacute; - m&iacute;-&aacute;dh, sl&aacute;n abhaile.  T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; le strucht&uacute;r l&aacute;idir, tr&eacute;dhearcach a shol&aacute;thar chun na pleananna Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm i gceart.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an pr&oacute;iseas sin oscailte don phobal.  Ba cheart go mbeadh strucht&uacute;r le haghaidh monat&oacute;ireacht neamhsple&aacute;ch ann, ach n&iacute;l sin ann.  Mar sin, n&iacute; bheidh muin&iacute;n ag an bpobal as na pleananna.  T&aacute; muin&iacute;n iontach ag muintir na Gaeilge as an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus ba cheart go mbeadh seisean i gceannas ar an mhonat&oacute;ireacht sin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; an Bille seo lochtach.  N&iacute; mo thuairim amh&aacute;in &iacute; seo, ach tuairim gach ceann de na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a raibh muid ag pl&eacute; leo faoi seo.  Is f&eacute;idir linn stop a chur leis an bpr&oacute;iseas agus sos a ghlacadh.  Is f&eacute;idir dul ar aghaidh le bac a chur ar na toghch&aacute;in don &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus an rud seo a phl&eacute; i gceart.  Is f&eacute;idir linn an-chuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh i dtaobh na Gaeltachta, obair nach gcosn&oacute;dh m&oacute;r&aacute;n.  N&iacute; bheidh costas n&iacute;os m&oacute; ar an Rialtas as seo amach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte nach bhfuil aigne n&oacute; intinn n&oacute; cro&iacute; an Aire St&aacute;it oscailte i dtaobh na hathruithe seo.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil an doras greamaithe aige in aghaidh na Gaeltachta&iacute;?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil cluas an Rialtais ar oscailt ar chor ar bith?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag tabhairt seans na ruda&iacute; seo a phl&eacute; i gceart.  Mar ad&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, t&aacute;imid ag fanacht leis an mBille seo le 60 bliain.  T&aacute; deis iontach againn anois.  Iarraim agus imp&iacute;m ar an Aire St&aacute;it athr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar seo anois.</P>

        <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on this Bill and to keep key an eye on my constituency colleague from Meath West opposite and monitor the telephone calls he has received.  I must take a note of the number he received.  I was lucky in that I grew up beside a Gaeltacht near Baile Ghib and I live quite close to R&aacute;th Cairn but I was not lucky enough to be part of a Gaeltacht.  That is probably my fault; it is the way life worked out.  I did not have a chance to live in a Gaeltacht and engage with the language and culture of one.  That is something one regrets as one gets older.  I was taught Irish at all levels in school but I did not learn to speak it well.  I could write Irish till the cows come home and I had no problem writing essays in Irish but I missed out on speaking it.  I was one of those who did not love the language when I was at school and felt it was almost a burden to have to study it.  Although I did not have a problem learning it, I missed out on the opportunity to speak it more.</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach sought to have a debate on the amount of spoken Irish in which we engage, I was disappointed that was seen as an attack on the language, which it was not.  The opposite was the case.  I understood where he was coming from on that.  I am glad the Minister of State likewise understands that there is a necessity to develop the spoken language and not to take for granted what happens to Gaeltacht areas.  Other stories will back that up.  That was a missed opportunity to have a good debate on how we could have more people speaking Irish, rather than only writing it or letting it slip on leaving school.  When I was in school - which is a number of years ago now; I must be getting old - learning Irish was a burden, but a few years after I left school, I regretted that I had not spoken and learned more Irish.  When I was first elected to the D&aacute;il, I and a number of Members attended an Irish class in the Houses to pick up the language again.</P>
        <P>The future of the Irish language is an issue and the subject of an ongoing debate we must have.  It is worrying to note from reports that there is a danger of the Irish language declining in Gaeltacht areas and that English is taking over in some areas.  I compliment the Minister of State on getting this Bill through Government and the fact that we are debating it today.  It will ensure that the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is retained and refocused in its intentions and that it will home in on what it should be doing, which is to safeguard and develop the Irish language mainly in Gaeltacht areas, which is where it is spoken at its best, although in other areas the use of the language is improving.  I always say in regard to business that one must protect the domestic market as best one can before developing outside markets.  The focus may have been taken off the Gaeltacht over the years and it was assumed the development of the language there was becoming stronger.  These reports show that the decline of the language there is an issue and I am glad we have a Minister who can react to and understand that and who is doing the right job in that respect.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill and the changes it will bring with it.  I might not agree with every aspect of it but that is what the debate on it is all about.  I support the focus of the Bill, which is on securing and developing the language mainly in Gaeltacht areas, and the process that it will go through.  There are a couple of main areas.  The Bill has two main aims, namely, to provide for a statutory language planning process to support the Irish language both within the Gaeltacht and nationwide, and to provide for changes to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I will speak briefly on those points.</P>
        <P>I welcome the local involvement in terms of the overall planning and that the various organisations will have to work with the local organisations to develop their plans.  It is essential to have such community involvement and that it is not a top-down approach.  I also welcome the introduction of the concept of Gaeltacht service towns, of which Athboy is one.  Such towns deserve a focus and plan in order to increase the use of the Irish language.  Athboy serves the Gaeltacht areas of R&aacute;th Cairn and Baile Ghib.  Much work is done which we cannot take for granted.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the elections to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the composition of the board.  My second election campaign was the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s election in 1999 to 2000.  It was an interesting campaign which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The Fine Gael candidate at the time was a girl called Mags Mulroe.  She was aged 19 or 20 and she had a love of the Irish language.  She did not live in a Gaeltacht but she lived in an area to which people from the west had moved and there was a love for the Irish language.  She got involved in the campaign and had a great election.  It was an eye-opener for me.  This will be my first return to such a subject, on which I missed out due to not having Irish and not being able to use as much of it as I would have liked.  I understand the importance of those elections but I also understand that one does not have to hold elections to get the right board and to get the board that will make the right decisions to protect the language and develop Gaeltacht areas as well.  At a time of scarce resources and when the money available to the Minister has been reduced to such an extent I can understand the logic in not holding elections, using the money elsewhere and spending it more wisely.  I am in agreement with that.  The local county councils will still provide a democratic system.</P>
        <P>I spoke at length to the Minister about the right to an automatic nominee to the board for smaller Gaeltacht areas, which covers Meath County Council, Cork and Waterford.  I am disappointed with the change but I know the Minister is examining the matter and I hope we can find a way to proceed.  I understand the logic of having a smaller board to save resources and because it is proving to be more effective.  The issue is not the number of members on the board; what is important is the quality of the membership.  I hope we can find a solution but it is important that all Gaeltacht areas are represented through their county councils.  I accept that is the case but my concern relates to the automatic right to a permanent nominee.  We must build on the process to ensure we get it right and that all Gaeltacht areas are represented.  It is important that people in all the areas can have an influence.  That is a key issue.  There are problems of language decline in Gaeltacht areas and I hope we can stem the tide following the introduction of the legislation and with the help of the resources the Minister of State has secured to develop the language.  We will work together on it.  I look forward to the debate in the coming week.</P>

        <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall labhairt as Gaeilge.  Nuair a thosaigh m&eacute; i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta deich mbliana &oacute; shin, n&iacute; raibh a l&aacute;n Gaeilge agam.  Bh&iacute; dearmad d&eacute;anta agam ar an m&eacute;id Gaeilge a d&rsquo;fhoglaim m&eacute; ar scoil.  Cos&uacute;il leis an Teachta English, n&iacute;or thug m&eacute; go leor aird don teanga nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar scoil.  Bh&iacute; br&oacute;n orm nuair a d&rsquo;fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an scoil.  Thar na blianta, d&rsquo;oibrigh m&eacute; ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeltacht agus th&aacute;inig mo chuid Gaeilge ar ais.  Bh&iacute; seans agam &iacute; a chleachtadh agus a fheabhs&uacute; ag clinic&iacute;, srl.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall inniu.  Gabhaim leithsc&eacute;al m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil mo chuid gramada&iacute; bocht.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte mh&oacute;r roimh an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis ina dtaobh sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach do mhuintir na h&aacute;ite go dt&eacute;ann an Aire St&aacute;it ann go minic.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; oscailte chun buaileadh le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; agus daoine &eacute;ags&uacute;la.

        <P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Cos&uacute;il leis an Teachta Griffin, t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm a r&aacute; nach bhfuil go leor cleachtadh d&eacute;anta agam ar mo chuid Gaeilge.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh fhoilsi&uacute; an Bhille seo, at&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, don teanga agus don chomhphobal.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn rath an fheachtais gaelscola&iacute;ochta d&uacute;inn go bhf&aacute;sfaidh agus go bhforbr&oacute;idh an teanga m&aacute; chuirimid plean ceart agus cu&iacute; i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute; mo neachtanna ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus iad ag freastal ar ghaelscoil.  T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as an gaelscoil i Wilton i gcathair Chorca&iacute;.  Cuireann an scoil &uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga chun cinn agus s&iacute;olra&iacute;onn gr&aacute; don teanga as a gcuid iarrachta&iacute;.  Mar sin, is maith an rud &eacute; go mbeidh bailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta againn.  Is beag an difr&iacute;ocht idir an teanga agus oidhreacht na bailte fearainn agus na bailte m&oacute;ra.  Chuala m&eacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ar an raidi&oacute; le Pat Kenny D&eacute; Ch&eacute;adaoin seo caite.  Labhair s&eacute; faoi chuairt a thug s&eacute; ar scoil at&aacute; lonnaithe &iacute; gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, &aacute;it ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar rogha na dtuismitheoir&iacute; agus rogha na ndalta&iacute;.  T&aacute; an paisean, an d&iacute;ograis agus an fuinneamh ag an Aire St&aacute;it chun sl&aacute;n&uacute; na Gaeltachta a chinnti&uacute; ionas go dtiocfaidh &aacute;r dteanga faoi bhl&aacute;th.  T&aacute; daoine i gCorcaigh buartha faoin gc&oacute;ras toghch&aacute;in agus an f&eacute;&iacute;direacht go gcaillf&iacute; toscaireacht, &aacute;fach.  Glacaim leis nach mb&iacute;onn na h&aacute;bhair seo furasta riamh.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister of State as he presents this Bill to the House.  Although I have a great interest in the language, I have allowed my use of it to slip.  As somebody with a sister who teaches tr&iacute; Ghaeilge in Col&aacute;iste Choilm and who has two nieces who love the language attending a gaelscoil, and as a lover of the language myself, I must agree with Deputy Creed, who using a great phrase, referred to the &ldquo;linguistic imperialism&rdquo; of many associated with the Irish language.  Those of us who should not have let the language slip, but who have made and make an effort, sometimes felt we were on a different planet and that our voices were not heard.  In light of this legislation, it is important that, based on the 20-year strategy outlined by the Government on coming into office, we consider how we can improve the Gaeltacht regions, the teaching of Irish and the use of the language.  As one, perhaps in a minority, who was happy to study and loved studying <i>Peig</i>,<i> Bulla&iacute; Mh&aacute;rtain</i> and<i> Fios Feasa, </i>I believe linguistic imperialism has caused our language not to flourish and created a barrier.</P>
        <P>We have noted the growth of the gaelscoil movement and how we have changed the curriculum in primary schools.  As the Minister of State said on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; some days ago, there are now gaelscoileanna in the middle of the capital city and the city of Cork.  Consequently, young people who do not have the cultural ethos of many of us are speaking Gaeilge and ag s&uacute;gradh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge gach l&aacute;.  This is to be welcomed.  It is a matter of changing the mindset regarding the creation of the Gaeltacht and the definition of the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath spoke about twinning and the Minister of State concurred with him.  I would love to see an extension in respect of the Gaeltacht regions and service towns.  Perhaps we should consider urban areas such as Baile an Easpaig, where there is a gaelscoil in Wilton, or parts of Dublin such as Ballymun with a view to creating linkages so they, too, can become Gaeltacht service towns.</P>
        <P>In my c&uacute;pla focal as Gaeilge, I expressed concerns raised in Cork regarding the Gaeltacht regions in the county.  Mr. Mick Scannell, a very strong, proud advocate of the Gaeltacht, is the type of ambassador we should allow to continue on the board.  I do not have a hang-up about the elections.  If one examines the excellent publication we received on the Bill from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, one will note a very strong piece therein regarding analysis carried out carried out as a consequence of the publication of the Str&aacute;it&eacute;is 20 Bliain.  People were unhappy with the board and were concerned about parochialism.  They alleged the board was controlled by political parties and said it might not have been representative of community organisations.  They spoke of the weakness of the board, its failure to consult and its constitution.</P>
        <P>We received an e-mail this morning from Conradh na Gaeilge asking us to speak about various matters.  Let us consider the family language support programme introduced this year.  Members and others should be aware-----</P>

        <P>If I were using empty platitudes, I would not be in this House speaking today; I would be at home in Cork.  I love my language and want to see it flourish, as do my colleagues.</P>
        <P>I know of teachers who are visiting Irish summer camps this week in Cork city and various other parts of the country.  They involve young people ag s&uacute;gradh agus ag caint tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus ag foghlaim Gaeilge in the middle of urban areas.  This did not happen when I was in school, nor did it happen ten years ago.</P>
        <P>The parents and those who educate and lead must be brought with us.  We cannot divide and conquer.  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n may sigh all he wants but his platitudes do not work and have not worked.</P>

        <P>I am in favour not of the traditional Sinn F&eacute;in divide-and-conquer approach but of what the Minister of State is doing.  I want to bring people together, le ch&eacute;ile, so we can have a language that is spoken and lived and in respect of which there is no differentiation.  Nobody would scorn me today, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has done, for entering the House to speak in support of Irish.</P>

        <P>I wish I could come in here and speak tr&iacute; Ghaeilge for my whole ten minutes but I cannot do so.  However, I hope I will be able to do so in time.  It is incumbent on all of us to allow the language to flourish and develop.  The gaelscoil movement has shown that the kinds of people who did not traditionally have Irish could take it on and learn it.  We must inculcate a love of the language.  This starts with us, not with the devolution of power to a chosen few.  It must begin with all of us, and that is why this Bill is important.  Perhaps on Committee Stage or other Stages, the Minister of State will consult again and listen.  He has listened already, however; he has travelled the country to do so.  He has no vested interest.  I have known him only for the past few years.  When I was in the Seanad, he asked me to try to speak as Gaeilge.  He did not dismiss me and that is why I want to see our language thrive.</P>
        <P>As a former m&uacute;inteoir scoile, I believe there is something fundamentally wrong if Irish students, on leaving school at 18 or 19, can speak better French and German than Irish.  We must change that.</P>

        <P>Ar dt&uacute;is, tugaim bu&iacute;ochas dos na Teachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir a th&aacute;inig isteach anseo inn&eacute; agus inniu agus a labhair maidir leis an mBille.  Aithn&iacute;m an d&uacute;thracht agus an d&aacute;ir&iacute;reacht a bh&iacute; ins an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt siad.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh difir idir thaobh amh&aacute;in den Teach agus an taobh eile de n&oacute; idir ph&aacute;irtithe.  Th&aacute;inig Teachta&iacute; isteach agus d&uacute;irt siad amach ona gcro&iacute;the, chomh soil&eacute;ir agus chomh hionraic agus is f&eacute;idir leo, an rud a sh&iacute;leann siad f&eacute;in ba ch&oacute;ir a dh&eacute;anamh.  C&eacute; acu a labhair siad i nGaeilge n&oacute; i mB&eacute;arla n&iacute; chuireann s&eacute; isteach ormsa ar chor ar bith.  Tuigim go bhfuil daoine nach bhfuil cumas Gaeilge acu.  Chuir an Teachta Buttimer a mh&eacute;ar ar rud &eacute;igin an-th&aacute;bhachtach, agus is fear &eacute; a bhfuil oideachas air agus Gaeilge aige ach, mar a d&uacute;irt s&eacute; f&eacute;in, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; a bheith n&iacute;os fearr.  T&aacute; daoine eile a chuaigh tr&iacute;d an ch&oacute;ras oideachais agus nach f&eacute;idir leo Gaeilge a labhairt.  Is comhartha &eacute; sin ar an teip at&aacute; ins an choras athbheochana &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t.  D&aacute; n-&eacute;ireofa&iacute; leis an ch&oacute;ras athbheochana &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t n&iacute; bheinnse istigh anseo inniu mar Aire St&aacute;it ag iarraidh Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm f&aacute; choinne an bheag&aacute;n cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais at&aacute; ins an Ghaeltacht a choinne&aacute;il ansin agus cur leo.  Ach cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh gach duine a labhair.  Th&aacute;inig 20 Teachta ar fad, idir inn&eacute; agus inniu, chun labhartha.  T&aacute; Teachta&iacute; anseo a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh a bheith sa bhaile i gContae na M&iacute;, i gContae Chiarra&iacute;, i gContae Chorca&iacute; ag amharc i ndiaidh a nd&aacute;ilcheantair ach t&aacute; siad s&aacute;sta fanacht anseo mar go bhfuil suim acu ins an &aacute;bhar seo agus ins an Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil rud &eacute;igin le r&aacute; acu.  Mar sin, tugaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas d&oacute;ibh.  Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; siosmaideach agus n&iacute; raibh &eacute;inne ag iarraidh an cluiche polait&iacute;ochta a imirt.  Bh&iacute; gach duine ag imirt an chluiche teanga. </P>
        <P>Since I was appointed Minister of State I have travelled the country.  Chuaigh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; na ceantair Gaeltachta ar fad agus chuaigh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; na ceantair nach bhfuil ins an Ghaeltacht.  An rud a chuaigh ina lu&iacute; orm n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; aon rud eile, and I am not talking about the Gaeltacht as such, is the great sense of goodwill, support, sympathy and understanding that is in these areas for the Irish language.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Moreover, I have been around here for long enough to realise this was not the case 20 or 30 years ago but that things have changed.  Perhaps it is because we now are members of the European Union, in which people hear other languages.  I believe there now exists a recognition that we have something special that we wish to maintain and hand on to the next generation.  Were I to introduce a Bill in this Chamber to abolish Irish altogether, I am unsure what would be the response.  It might be more positive than the response I will receive on foot of this strategy.  As I mentioned previously, I visited Clondalkin last Tuesday week, to name but one area.  Similarly, I visited County Clare some weeks ago and Bantry some weeks before that.  These are places which lie outside the Gaeltacht and I was really encouraged to see what is going on in such areas.  There is a community in Clondalkin, encompassing &Aacute;ras Chron&aacute;in, to which hundreds come every day and in which everything is done through the medium of Irish.  No one ordered them to do it and no Government edict asked them to do it but it simply has come from the people themselves.  In addition, there are a number of schools there, both primary and post-primary, in which the medium is Irish.  It is highly encouraging for someone like me, who comes from a Gaeltacht area, to see 1,200 pupils in an area outside the Gaeltacht pursuing their primary and post-primary education through the medium of Irish.  I met one such person today who works for a newspaper and who conducted an interview through the medium of Irish although he was not from the Gaeltacht.  This is what one wishes for and that is the kind of enthusiasm and support I wish to harness when implementing this 20-year strategy.  It is not directed towards the Gaeltacht alone but also towards the non-Gaeltacht areas.  As I stated earlier, I visited Bantry a number of weeks ago, where I had the honour and privilege of gaelscoil a oscailt go hoifigi&uacute;il.  N&iacute; baile Gaeltachta &eacute; Bantry ach t&aacute; scoil an-deas ann.  It is a state-of-the-art school with approximately 200 pupils from the age of four up to 12 and the Irish language is natural to them.  Although they do not live in the Gaeltacht, their parents decided this was the way their children should be taught, namely, through the medium of Irish.  Moreover, having gone through that educational system, which only encompasses the primary sector, they will be fluent in Irish.  This is going on in many parts of the country.  I mentioned one school in Bantry but there is not a city or county in Ireland that has not one gaelscoil or more.  I see great signs of encouragement outside Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>An pr&iacute;omh rud a bh&iacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge n&aacute; go gcaithfimid plean&aacute;il teanga a chur i bhfeidhm.  We can talk about ruda&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht isteach ach is &eacute; an pr&iacute;omh rud at&aacute; sa strait&eacute;is, chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an Ghaeltacht, n&aacute; ceantair plean&aacute;la teanga a chur ar bun.  Is &eacute; an pr&iacute;omh rud at&aacute; sa Bhille go mbeidh 19 gceantar plean&aacute;la teanga ar fud na Gaeltachta agus go mbeidh s&eacute; de fhreagracht ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta cuidi&uacute; leis na pobail ansin plean teanga a ullmh&uacute; agus spriocanna, cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; agus aidhmeanna a leagan s&iacute;os.  Caithfidh siad a bheith inghlactha ag an Roinn.  Beidh comhairle agus cuidi&uacute; agus taca&iacute;ocht le f&aacute;il &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil eolas 30 bliain aige ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta.  Beidh cuidi&uacute; agus taca&iacute;ocht le f&aacute;il &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute; oifigigh na Roinne, at&aacute; ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta le 57 bliana.  Beimid ag iarraidh ar an phobal ceannaireacht agus &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht a ghlacadh ar na pleananna.</P>
        <P>The plans will be theirs, and the Government will give them every assistance and help.  I acknowledge the situation is critical, in that between 96,000 and 97,000 people live in Gaeltacht areas, of whom 23,000 or one in four speak Irish every day.  If this is allowed to continue, we will be in serious trouble, as the suirbh&eacute; teanga or linguistic survey has indicated, within 15 to 20 years.  When I came into office, I told myself this problem must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work of the officials in my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and of everyone else who has been of assistance in bringing this Bill before the House.  The Bill is crucial and will have serious implications for the language in the Gaeltacht areas and the country in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Mention has been made of acmhainn&iacute;, or resources.  T&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; teoranta againn.  Luaigh Teachta&iacute; James Healy, Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan, Clare Daly, Dara Calleary, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Joe Higgins, Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n agus eile na hacmhainn&iacute;.  T&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; an-th&aacute;bhachtach.  D&uacute;irt mise an rud c&eacute;anna nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar an taobh eile den Teach.  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta ins an t&iacute;r agus caithfimid gn&iacute;omh&uacute; taobh istigh des na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; againn.  I mbliana, t&aacute; &euro;60 milli&uacute;n curtha ar f&aacute;il ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  I reiterate that &euro;60 million has been made available this year for the promotion of Irish, both within and outside the Gaeltacht.  Moreover, this excludes &euro;500 million I understand is provided by the Department of Education and Skills to promote Irish in the education system.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; TG4, teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, agus na tr&eacute;imhseach&aacute;n againn.  Sin an-chuid airgid.

        <P>The &uacute;dar&aacute;s is delighted it now has a challenge to go out among the people and communities of the Gaeltacht.  It considers that with the limited resources available, it will be able to make a significant impact with these schemes.  I have been assured and reassured that with the limited resources available, as long as they are spent in the right way, there will be a return on these resources that will be of benefit to the language in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

        <P>N&iacute;or thuig m&eacute; &eacute; sin.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. N&aacute; b&iacute;m&iacute;s ag cuimhni&uacute; ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s at&aacute; imithe.  We are in a different country.  T&aacute; an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s &uacute;r ag teacht isteach.  Is &eacute; an rud at&aacute; mise ag iarraidh ins an &uacute;dar&aacute;s &uacute;r, saineolas agus raon don daonlathas.  I seek saineolas or expertise in language planning and in both language and industrial promotion, as the authority has an industrial remit.  I assure Deputy Creed, who spoke in this regard, that an industrial remit will be retained.  Moreover, there will be a democratic input, as five representatives will come from the different Gaeltacht areas.  Hopefully, when a fully formed board of 12 members has been put in place, no Gaeltacht will be left without some form of representation.  However, those who are appointed to the board will not be appointed to look after their own little patch or parish.  I seek people with wider horizons and a wider outlook on the issue, whose purpose is to save the language in the Gaeltacht.  The new priority of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be an teanga a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; fiontra&iacute;ochta go maith ach an teanga a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil fonn ormsa go mbeidh na scileanna seo ag na daoine a bheidh ar an bhord.</P>
        <P>Public advertisements will be placed in <i>publicjobs.ie</i> asking people with qualifications in language planning and linguistics, as well as academics and industrialists, to send in their <i>curricula vitae</i> if they think they can meet the requirements for these positions.  The process will be open and transparent and this is the kind of &uacute;dar&aacute;s to which I look forward over the next five years.  Incidentally, the new chairman, who will be appointed by the Government, will appear before the committee and will explain to the people and the members of that committee what his or her aims will be and the reason he or she should be qualified to be the Chairman.  This is a new departure.  People assert it will be political because the Government will make these appointments.  However, it could not be more political than the outgoing &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I have nothing against politics, as all Members are politicians after all.  Similarly, many county councillors are on the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and while there is nothing wrong with county councillors, I seek the kind of mix to which I referred earlier.  Incidentally, for the first 20 years of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, people were elected.  What happened at the last election?  There was a political tag put on every candidate.  Some were for Sinn F&eacute;in, some for Fianna F&aacute;il, some for the Labour Party, some for Fine Gael and some were non-party but they were well and truly tagged and now people want to take politics out of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  All I can say is that I hope the next &uacute;dar&aacute;s will not be as political as the outgoing &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I hope that satisfies the Deputy.</P>

County councils elect people to the Seanad.  I was never going to say the Seanad is not democratic, and I do not think any Senator would say it.</P>

        <P>Does Sinn F&eacute;in have anyone in the Seanad?  It does of course, how could I forget Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and all the difficulties he caused me last week?  He was democratically elected.  Is Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n telling me if we elect members to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta they are not democratically elected?  Hopefully they will be from the Gaeltacht and, if they are not, it is specifically stated in the Bill that they must be able to carry out the work of the new &uacute;dar&aacute;s i nGaeilge.</P>
        <P>I do not want to be confrontational: I do not want to be critical.  I have been here for more than 30 years and I have been given this opportunity to do something to save the Irish language.  That is my remit now.</P>

        <P>I have no bone to pick with any Deputy, I appreciate all they have said.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.  They have all been positive and we all want to achieve the same objective.  I do not want to leave this House or this world without any Gaeltachta&iacute;.  I want to turn the tide and this is the way we can do it.  I am implementing the most important aspect of the survey of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht - the language planning areas.  Outside the Gaeltachta&iacute;, I want to look after those communities that have decided of their own free will that they want to have their children educated through Irish: we want to offer them every support.  We will have the &uacute;dar&aacute;s on the one hand, the foras on the other and all of us working together.  It is a new departure.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo le beagnach 30 bliain, over 30 years.  For most of the Gaeltacht or language legislation that went through this House, I was on the Opposition benches.  I have spent 90% of my time over there and we never divided on the language.  We always supported the Government of the day.  Thug m&eacute; taca&iacute;ocht don Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v le Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la agus leis an Ghaeilge mar theanga oibre ag leibh&eacute;al na hEorpa.  There were two areas where the House never divided: the Irish language and the national question.  We always thought the Irish language was above politics and we do not divide on it.  I hope the Opposition will come with me on this expedition to try to save the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>
