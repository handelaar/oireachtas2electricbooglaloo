	<P>As the House will be aware, the Government decided last week that the new Irish water utility is to be an independent State-owned subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  The new water utility is not and will not be included in the Government&rsquo;s programme of State asset disposals.  The Government is committed to keeping it under State control. </P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann is an excellent example of a strong, vibrant and dynamic State company, which has demonstrated its capacity to invest and develop new, efficient and competitive business for the benefit of Irish consumers.  In taking last week&rsquo;s decision, the Government&rsquo;s intention was that a number of key synergies would be achieved between the gas and the water utilities core network functions, such as operating in a regulated environment, network management, metering and utility operation systems.  It is also important to note that these core functions will not be impacted by the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, the energy generation and supply business of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, which I previously announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s State asset disposal programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister did not get the gist of the purpose of my question.  Earlier this year, on 22 February, the Minister announced the Government had decided to sell Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy business.  Be that as it may, we will not discuss whether it is a good idea in this debate.  Subsequently, last week the Government decided in light of the experience and knowledge of Bord G&aacute;is about metering, billing and dealing with hundreds and thousands of consumers throughout the country it should be given the job of dealing with the provision of water meters.  In his opening comment the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to frame a question please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>In his opening comment the Minister spoke about an independent subsidiary.  These two words are mutually contradictory; a subsidiary is under something else and not independent by definition.  Will the Minister accept that regardless of whether the Minister, Deputy Hogan, made a hames of his role in the proposed metering of water, he will be held responsible for the possible privatisation of water meters throughout Ireland because he, as Minister, has opted to give that business to a company, part of which Government has already decided to privatise?  The Government has decided to sell-off part of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, and, because of its expertise in metering and billing households, to give it responsibility for the new water utility.  Will the Minister accept that the public will find it hard not to view this as a key step along the road to privatisation, which I accept is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention at this stage?  However, in light of this, I ask that the Government remove to Bord G&aacute;is from its list of companies to be privatised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Let me be crystal clear, the new State company, Irish Water, will, as far as the Government and I are concerned, be a wholly State owned company<i> per omnia saecula saeculorum</i>.  This will be enshrined in specific legislation to be introduced.  Irish Water will be a State company providing water in an integrated manner across the State.  It is wholly different from the sale of the energy generating component of BGE.  We want to keep the expertise that set up and developed BGE and to use it in setting up the next fine State company.  Things are not set in aspic.  The next major State company, the biggest since the ESB was founded, will be Irish Water.  Bord G&aacute;is Eireann, in terms of its level of expertise in managing a publicly owned company with a distribution, billing and metering system, has the management structure which the Government wants to roll out over time &mdash; it will be years before all of this is put in place properly &mdash; the new Irish Water company.  That is the logic behind it.</P>
        <P>The parallel issue of setting up competition within the energy sector, which the energy generating component of BGE will provide as competition for the wholly State owned ESB, will also be good for the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept that the more he speaks the more he confuses the issue in the public mind?  The Minister stated in his initial reply that Irish Water would be an independent subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.  In his subsequent reply he said it would be a wholly owned State company.  It cannot be both.  It must be one or the other.  It will be owned by Bord G&aacute;is, not the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The State owns Bord G&aacute;is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not own the shares in its subsidiary companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not, Bord G&aacute;is owns them.  The Minister should check company law.  One does not own the assets of a company just because one owns a share in it.  That is a fact.  I again plead with the Minister to remove Bord G&aacute;is from its list of companies to be part privatised by way of the sale of assets given it is the company to which the Government is giving the water metering and billing service in regard to the provision of water.  The two services should not be combined in one company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought earlier that the Deputy was just being inquisitive.  I know now he is being mischievous.  I will clarify the position again.  Irish Water will be set up as a subsidiary of a wholly owned State company, namely, BGE.  It will be wholly State owned.  It is intended&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>BGE will be the parent company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The State owns BGE and every aspect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It owns a share of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is engaging in tautology.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the new Irish Water entity &mdash; this will be put in statute law and debated in the House &mdash; will be wholly State owned.   Parallel to that, as part of the memorandum of understanding, we have looked at what non-strategic assets we could sell off.  The Government has come to the conclusion that allowing for greater competition in the energy sector through the privatisation of the energy generating element of BGE, and for private competition to the wholly owned public entity, the ESB, which will remain as a vertically integrated wholly State company, will be good for the Irish consumer.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has brought to Cabinet the findings of his Department&rsquo;s review of allowances and premium payments paid to public sector workers; and if he intends to make public these findings.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20540/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware from my previous replies, on 5 December last, during my address on the 2012 Expenditure Estimates, I announced that a review of allowances and premium payments would be carried out by my Department.  This announcement was made on foot of a Government decision which requires the public service to take additional measures to deliver further efficiencies in 2012 and thereby ensure the pay bill targets which have been set are met, with a view to delivering additional pay savings in 2013 and subsequent years.  The measures include a reduction of 10%, or approximately &euro;40 million, in overtime payments in 2012.  This is being achieved by means of a reduction in allocations for overtime by that amount.  To date, my Department has received well over 800 business cases in respect of allowances and premium payments.  As a result of resource constraints, the volume of submissions to be evaluated and the complexity and variance of allowances across all sectors, it has not been possible to complete the review in a short timeframe.  Indeed, agencies and Departments are continuing to propose business cases and seek further explanations in advance of the completion of the review.  I will bring proposals to the Government in relation to the findings of the review as soon as it has been completed.  In the interim, urgent business case requests are being processed, in so far as possible, to ensure the work of the public service is not unduly disrupted by the review.  The outcome of the review of particular allowances will be communicated to Departments and subsequently made public.  I have indicated my expectation that further discussions with the relevant staff representative bodies will be required before we reach that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the Minister does not believe allowances and premium payments fall under the definition of &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for the purposes of the Croke Park agreement.  He will be aware that the public service unions take a different view.  The teachers&rsquo; unions &mdash; the TUI and the ASTI &mdash; and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation have been quite trenchant in their defence of these payments as part and parcel of what is understood as &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for the purposes of the Croke Park agreement.  I ask the Minister to clarify his view on that matter.  Can he say whether any changes or cuts that might emerge from the review will apply solely to new entrants?  Does he envisage that they would also apply to workers who are currently in employment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The allowances cover an extraordinary range of entities across the public service and relate to many different issues.  Some of them could quite reasonably be acknowledged as being part of core payments even though they are called &ldquo;allowances&rdquo;.  The Deputy will recall that last week, we debated a so-called allowance that is payable to a Minister of State.  I regard that as a wage.  There are analogies to that across the public service.  Some of the allowances in question are historic.  When the Deputy reads all 800 cases in due course, she will raise an eyebrow when she comes across some cases and she will wonder whether there is a place for them.  The Deputy asked whether I regard these allowances and premiums as being part of core pay.  In some instances, they are.  In many instances, they are not.  She also asked whether any changes will apply to new entrants only.  By and large, they will apply to new entrants only.  There might not be a sustainable business case in some instances.  When I answered that question in exactly that fashion last week, a great deal of news print was devoted to what I had to say.  It is clear that there is no longer a justification for some historic allowances.  I will seek to address those in the current framework.  The changes to most allowances will affect new entrants only.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not forget the teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the additional payment of &euro;17,000 that is made to &ldquo;super-juniors&rdquo;.  We have debated that matter.  I repeat that I find it extraordinary that the Minister is standing over that payment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at a time when he is reviewing premium payments for other workers who are on far lower wages than the Ministers of State concerned.</P>
        <P>I find the Minister&rsquo;s answer unsatisfactory.  On the question of whether the allowances and premia are part of core pay, he stated &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  On the question of whether new entrants alone will be affected, he stated &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Minister undertook the review exercise not having consulted a broad range of people, including the unions.  Perhaps the Department is still a little at sea in terms of processing.  The Minister referred to tight resources and receiving business cases.  Is this not a very messy response that he has given?  Is it not a very messy process?  Workers and their representative bodies would prefer a much more clear-cut answer in respect of whether and allowances constitute core pay.  &ldquo;Yes but no&rdquo; is not a satisfactory answer.  On the fundamental question of whether new entrants or workers across the board will be affected, I would have expected the Minister to have been in a position to answer in a much more straightforward way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a propensity for reducing both complicated and simple issues to black-and-white responses of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;; it suits the narrative.  I could give the Deputy 800 answers because this is the number of individual allowances, some of which fall into the category of core pay and others of which patently do not.  When we have finished the review of over 800 individual allowances, we will be able to answer all the questions.  It is taking some time to do that.  That it is messy to review all the allowances because it has not been done before does not mean the review should not be undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be undertaken in a coherent way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should tell us about the teachers&rsquo; allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point I am trying to make.  This is the first review of all the allowances in God knows how many years, if ever.  We are reviewing every sector of expenditure for the first time in my Department so we can determine objectively whether shoe allowances or others are proper and fit for purpose in 2012 and in the current economic climate.  I will be making a discernment on that and will present it to the House for its views thereon in due course.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Clare Daly</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on whether an emergency programme of necessary public works could put 100,000 persons to work on necessary infrastructure development within 2012.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[11608/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Before this question can be considered, it is necessary to point out that the sort of capital works programme required to create 100,000 new construction jobs in a given year would require a minimum of &euro;10 billion in expenditure on top of existing allocations, and such funding is just not available.  While some of this may be recoverable in the form of tax receipts and reduced welfare costs, very significant costs to the Exchequer would remain.  This would require us to reduce dramatically expenditure on the current side and institute additional taxes on a scale significantly above those already imposed.</P>
        <P>The quantum of pain to ordinary people that this would involve would be extreme.  Moreover, this approach ignores the significant improvements in our infrastructure that have been made to date, as attested to by the OECD.  It is worth noting that, over the past decade, some &euro;70 billion was invested in infrastructure and the productive sector.  Judged by a range of measures, the quality and quantity of the country&rsquo;s stock of infrastructure has been considerably augmented in recent years.</P>
        <P>Even were additional funding available, it is questionable whether such an approach would be feasible or the most effective means of creating new employment.  Capital planning must be undertaken with meticulous attention to detail to ensure that the infrastructure being proposed meets a genuine social or economic demand that cannot be adequately met by the private sector and that, if the infrastructure is necessary, the project approach that provides the best outcomes, value for money and optimum return to the State is undertaken.</P>
        <P>In regard to job creation, it is important to note that much of the capital programme for the next five years as laid out in the infrastructure and capital investment programme will be geared towards smaller, more labour-intensive projects.  However, it is not necessarily the case that capital works programmes would provide the optimal job-creation approach.  Infrastructure best serves the economy by aiding economic growth and generating sustainable jobs in the medium term, rather than by providing short-term employment in its construction phase.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Capital investment in enterprise supports has the highest direct employment impact.  Accordingly, the capital review undertaken last year made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years and in 2012 delivered through the enterprise development agencies can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery.  While the overall capital envelope for 2012 has been reduced, we have held the level of capital allocation for the enterprise sector relative to the preceding period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has given his answer to his colleagues in SIPTU who, precisely, are looking for a &euro;10 billion investment programme in infrastructure in order to call for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the austerity treaty.  I think the answer to the question is that it is possible.  Such an investment of &euro;10 billion would create&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Deputy is supposed to ask a question rather than answer one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;100,000 jobs in this sphere.  The Minister seems to have mistaken &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; to mean solely construction projects even though the question did not ask that.  It dealt with all aspects of infrastructure that could deal with the programme which is seriously necessary and which the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said will be delivered in terms of child care infrastructure and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will you frame a question please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister to deal with that aspect and why he thought the question just related to construction when it did not and how he sees this fitting in with the treaty discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is quite wrong if she interpreted it as a rejection of the SIPTU line in regard to economic stimulus and not infrastructural spend.  Its demand was for economic stimulus.  I have met the presidents of SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter.</P>
        <P>Can I say very emphatically that Government policy has three strands?  Certainly, we need to have a balanced budget by working towards a 3% deficit by 2015 as laid out in the Stability and Growth Pact.  Equally, we recognise there is a need for a stimulus package and we have been working on ways to do that.  It is important that a third of the proceeds of the sale of State assets will be involved in infrastructure and stimulus.  At the instigation of the trade union movement, we have been engaged with the pension funds because we want to ensure more of the pension funds, which ordinary workers pay into, are expended in this economy.  I have had direct discussions with the European Investment Bank and other international lenders.  I have met with the vice president of the European Investment Bank and I have more meetings coming up.</P>
        <P>I say all of this to give the Deputy the absolute assurance that we regard stimulus as a very important co-strategy to ensure we meet the targets of economic recovery we have laid out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly, the reality is the opposite.  The Minister is presiding over an economy that is in a depression and he has not delivered any stimulus whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not will us to fail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The reality is that circumstances and resources exist in this country and necessary work and materials are in place which could, for example, deal with the archaic water mains infrastructure which could put tens of thousands of people to work repairing that network.  In regard to the septic tank debacle, does the Minister think householders are going to solve that crisis on their own?  It is a civil engineering matter.  I mention areas in my constituency and Wavin pipes.  The materials are there as are the workers but this Government has failed to match the two.  Clearly, it is quite happy to preside over half a million people on the dole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Deputy prefers to make speeches than ask questions even at Question Time.  There are Deputies in this House who wish us to fail, which is shocking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The constant down talking of our economy is not without its own consequence.  We were bequeathed the most disastrous economic hand ever left to a Government.  We have set out a strategy to get us to recovery.  I have said to the Deputy that it cannot be done by balancing the budget alone, although that is an integral part which she has entirely ignored.  We cannot continue to borrow &euro;1.4 billion per month.  There is only one borrower and it set out conditions on the terms of borrowing.  The Deputy knows that because she is fully briefed in regard to these matters, but she wants to pretend life is otherwise.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy is right to the extent that we need stimulation of the economy as well, although not with magic money but with real money and that is why we have identified the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the pension funds which, hopefully, we can persuade or encourage to invest in this economy.  We have established NewERA and the strategic investment fund as a precursor of a State investment bank.  We are very much on the stimulus agenda and we will succeed in getting this economy right.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I announced on 4 April that the Government had decided to hold a competition for the next national lottery licence.  The licence will be for a 20-year period and will involve an upfront payment to the State with part of this payment being used to help fund the building of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  No decision has yet been taken on the terms of the competition for the next licence.  Before a competition can commence, the Government is committed to introducing primary legislation to revise the National Lottery Act 1986.  My Department is carrying out the necessary preparatory work on that legislation.</P>
        <P>The integrity of the process is a high priority and ongoing work is being led by officials in my Department.  I stated in my announcement on 4 April that the ongoing provision of a fixed percentage of annual lottery turnover for good causes will be a legislative condition of the next licence.  This percentage for good causes will be retained at 30.5% of lottery sales, which was the level that was achieved in 2011.</P>
        <P>Regarding prizes, the National Lottery Act contains a provision that at least 40% of sales must be returned to players as prizes.  I do not envisage this provision being changed.</P>
        <P>Regarding retail outlets authorised to sell national lottery tickets, I am cognisant of the essential role retailers play in the operation of the lottery.  I am also aware of the importance to retailers of income from the lottery, particularly in the present economic climate.  The position of retailers will be taken into consideration in the context of the arrangements for the next lottery licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister.  I acknowledge that he addressed the last portion of my question, namely, the percentage for good causes and prizes in the retailers&rsquo; margin, but the essence of my question was different.  When Fine Gael and Labour were last in government, one of their last actions was to issue the second mobile telephone licence.  We all know that substantial issues were raised about the then Government&rsquo;s handling of that process.  What measures will the Minister put in place to ensure something similar does not apply in this instance?  I do not want to revisit the mobile telephone issue, as we all know what was involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that the bidding process will commence in October.  Will he explain which external consultants will be employed to carry it out, how will it be done and will the lobbyist Bill be published prior to a final decision?  In the interests of ensuring the integrity of the process, will the Government ensure that people tendering for it or those working on their behalf will not have access to Ministers through the front door, back door or pub door, whichever the case may be?  Will the Minister reassure the House to this effect?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy makes a valid point of which I am cognisant.  I want to ensure that any process involving my Department or the Government is transparent and has no external pressures or influences placed on it.  I have issued a protocol to myself as well as to every senior official&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister issue it publicly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I would have no difficulty with placing it on a website.  The protocol relates to all of these matters.  For example, I will not meet anyone &mdash; I have received calls from all over the place from people who want to see me or my advisers &mdash; in respect of these matters.  There is one access point at arm&rsquo;s length for people who will advise others on how to go about the process.  This will apply in the case of every sale of State assets, in that I will not be directly lobbied and I will not meet anyone regarding those matters.  If people have something to say, they will talk in an open fashion to the people charged with handling their communications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear that and I would welcome the protocol&rsquo;s publication, which was news to me.  Will the Minister consider the lobbyist Bill?  During this process, which will last for 12 months or so, people who know people who know people will inevitably contact Ministers through various mechanisms, as occurred previously.  We want to ensure that the scoring card by which the ultimate decision is made will be public and transparent so that there can be no allegations or suggestions that the card can be changed at the last moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  He is right and it is good to have this discussion at an early stage.  It is my firm intention to achieve that.  Regarding the register of lobbyists Bill, I am anxious that it proceed.   There are a number of linked Bills.  For example and as the Deputy knows, the detailed heads of the whistleblowers legislation are before the committee.  I hope I will receive a response before the summer, but I do not know whether the committee has decided to hold hearings on it.  The Freedom of Information Act amendment is proceeding and I hope to have it published by the end of the year.  A great deal is happening on this front.</P>
        <P>The registering of lobbyists is a difficult matter.  Everybody lobbies to some extent and a considerable amount of legitimate lobbying is done by, for example, child care groups on child care and farmers on agricultural policy.  As long as this is done in an upfront and transparent manner and there is no inducement of any description, it will be very good.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he will consider taking responsibility for the collation of cross-departmental data on increments paid across the public sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20541/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has access to detailed data on increments only in the Civil Service sector, for which I have direct responsibility.  Detailed pay roll data for other public servants, including that for increments, are held and managed by individual public service employers.  The availability of specific data on increments varies across those bodies.  For example, detailed data on the cost of increments in the local authority sector is not currently available to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as it covers 34 individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>I have no plans for my Department to assume responsibility on an operational basis for the collation of pay roll data across the public service.  Detailed data on increments are not currently available or readily accessible within the sectors.  No specific financial provision is made to public service bodies in respect of increments because they are required to meet the cost within their overall pay allocations.  As it is a matter for public service bodies to manage the cost of increments on an individual basis within their individual pay allocations, details are not sought for expenditure planning purposes and the information does not form part of the estimates process.  However, the public service reform plan provides for a move to shared services across the public service and this will ensure greater accuracy of data and provide access to improved management information in real time.  This is one of the many strategic benefits of shared services.</P>
        <P>On increments generally, based on more detailed information recently requested by my Department on the total cost of increments in a full year in the various sectors, the estimated full year cost of increments in the public service excluding the local authority sector is estimated at no more than &euro;180 million per annum and less than half that sum in 2012.  Significantly reduced recruitment, the ongoing substantial fall in numbers of public servants and higher numbers reaching the maxima of scales have reduced the cost of increments.  This cost will continue to fall over the coming years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question because the issue of increments has given rise to considerable public comment.  In previous exchanges we established that cuts to or stoppage of increments would disproportionately affect people on lower incomes.  I raise the issue not because I want the Minister to cut increments, but due to my astonishment at discovering that his Department does not possess the kind of data which I would have expected it to gather and which the chairperson of the Croke Park implementation body, P.J. Fitzpatrick, assumed it already possessed.  It is important not only that the Department gather the data in question, but also that it become a repository for them.</P>
        <P>The Minister should be able to take a bird&rsquo;s eye view.  He cited the figures of &euro;180 million globally and &euro;90 million this year but he should have a more in-depth sense of what is going on.  He recently announced his plans to establish a Government economic evaluation service with a staff of 20 to 30.  If he is not going to be in the business of acquiring and storing detailed data and analysis on public sector pay, why does he want this unit?  I asked him a direct question regarding whether he will assume responsibility for that kind of information.  He appears to be saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; but I do not think that makes sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  I am anxious to amass as much data on all public expenditure as possible.  Bluntly, however, I was more than surprised &mdash; let me put it in a kind way &mdash; at the lack of overview of all public expenditure that resided in the former Department of Finance.  Some of the detailed questions the Deputy raised over the past 12 months have helped to expose this issue.  We are pulling all of that together but there is always a conflict between the total cost of implementing certain initiatives and the value one gets from them.  As we move towards our objective of an integrated public service we have discovered all the various arrangements.  For example the Deputy will have seen that arrangements for leave and sick pay vary across agencies and Departments.  We will have a commonality about that and we are working might and main to do that.  In the context of doing all that we will have a much more integrated overview of every issue including increments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned the issue of data on expenditure on local authority pay.  It is astonishing that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government does not have that information.  It is mind boggling particularly given that the Government has correctly placed such an emphasis on scrutinising expenditure.  However, the Government cannot do that if there are big gaps in the information provided to it.  Given that the Minister has been in his new Department for more than a year, I would have thought he would have insisted that the Department for the Environment, Community and Local Government would have access to that information and more to the point that he would have it.  How can we have any rational debate on these matters when much of the time, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working on guess work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very unfair to say we are working on guess work &mdash; we understand the full quantum of pay in the total sums.  However, we do not have it disaggregated to the degree the Deputy feels we ought to have at a central level.  There is always a divergence of view about devolution.  We call it local government and not national government in a local setting.  The local authorities have autonomy in a number of the functions they perform and they decide the specific skills they need in their own functional areas.  Not every local authority is identical in the skill set required because obviously a predominantly rural local authority has a different skillset requirement than an urban one has.  Consistent with proper oversight and ensuring proper value for money, I believe the Deputy is correct.  However, we also need to balance that with ensuring a degree of autonomy at local level if we are to have local government worthy of that title.</P>

        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he is satisfied with the management of retirements from the public sector that took place up to the end of February 2012; the number of retirements he expects between now and the end of 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20261/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to report to the House that the management of retirements from the public sector at the ending of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; on 29 February last was broadly successful.  This is not to say that there were not problems in some locations in the public service, rather that any problems that arose were resolved locally as is right and proper.</P>
        <P>Returns from the various sectors indicate that approximately 8,500 public servants will retire this year.  Latest reports from the various sectors within the public service indicate that some 8,000 retired in the first two months of the year.  The staffing number returns for the end of the first quarter in 2012 are being received by my Department at present from across all the sectors.  These will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website in the usual manner and will show the updated and confirmed position at that point.</P>
        <P>There was a degree of hype in the run-up to the end of February.  One broadcaster asked me to be on stand-by to meet the Y2K level of catastrophe that was supposed to happen but did not.  I am glad that there were no significant issues.  I pay tribute to local managers and workers across the public service who managed that significant downsizing, which would normally represent a year&rsquo;s out-take, in two months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the information where he indicated that 8,000 have retired up to the end of February and he expects possibly another 500 to leave over the subsequent ten months up to the end of the year.  Does that meet his original target as I thought there was a figure of closer to 9,000?  How many new people will be recruited to fill the vacancies created by the 8,500 who have retired or will be retiring?  The obvious area is teaching.  A number of those retiring are teachers and many of them must be replaced &mdash; there is no question about that.  In how many cases has the Minister given approval for the recruitment embargo to be lifted?  I know the HSE got a budget to recruit additional staff in the primary care and mental health areas.  It was given a budget to do so and once it does not exceed that budget it does not need to go back to the Minister for supplementary approval on a post-by-post basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy to give a detailed briefing to the Deputy in that regard.  We will have to move on in a few minutes, so I probably will not be able to give the Deputy a comprehensive answer.  However, I will give the specifics.  The announcement I made with regard to public sector numbers was that by 2015 numbers would have reduced to 282,500.  The outturn figure for the end of last year was 296,872, and this year&rsquo;s figure under the employment control framework is 294,401.  That is, in ballpark figures, where we started, where we are going and where we are now.  It is conservative to suggest an outflow figure of 8,500 for this year; that is the figure I have been given.  The current estimated figure for the first two months, which might change by one or two, is 8,168, so we will exceed the figure of 8,500.  However, it is my intention, as I have indicated, to allow some staff back in key pressure areas.  As the Deputy has seen, for example, the Army is currently recruiting in an attempt to get back to its complement of 9,500, and there are other sectors under pressure in which we need to bring specific skills back.  Most teachers, because of the pupil-teacher ratio, are being replaced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned some time ago that the next set of retirements would be targeted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>He might explain what he means by that.  Will retirement be made available for specific grades while other grades are excluded, or will it apply to a certain coterie of employees with X number of years&rsquo; service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good question.  Many people did not understand &mdash; although obviously those in the House did &mdash; the nature of the exit at the end of February.  Put simply, those who were coming up to retirement did a calculation in which they compared their expected retirement pensions and lump sums with the amount that would be available at the end of the grace period and decided, based on this, whether it was in their interest to leave.  Many people left, but they were mostly people who were on the edge of retirement &mdash; within a year or two or within a few months of retirement.</P>
        <P>We had no control over who left in February, and we lost some people a year or two early whom we would have preferred to hold on to for a couple more years.  If there is to be more downsizing it will be on a targeted basis, applying to areas in which we clearly have too many people whom we cannot redeploy within the terms of the Croke Park agreement.  We have made no decisions on that, but I will keep the Deputy informed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not let what the Minister said go.  He struck almost a smug note when he said there were concerns about the large exodus from the public sector and its consequences.  He has acknowledged the good work of public servants, which is correct, but could he also acknowledge the fact that public services are under significant pressure?  It would be entirely misleading for us to have a false debate in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;implying that the exodus had no consequences in terms of service provision.  I ask the Minister at least to acknowledge that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I readily acknowledge it.  If there was any smugness about my statement it certainly was not intended.  I was anxious that things would go smoothly during that period, and I pay public tribute to those who ensured it did, that is, local managers across every sector and local workers who increased productivity and flexibility to ensure the impact on front line services was minimised.  Of course there were pressure points, but they were addressed locally, and I commend people on doing so.</P>
        <P>We are in the process of downsizing the public service, of doing more with less.  We have had enormous gains in flexibility.  The Deputy might join with me in congratulating those who have embraced the Croke Park process and who have proven that we can achieve an awful lot more with co-operation than with coercion.  I am proud of the increases in flexibility that have been achieved across virtually every sector of the public service through the Croke Park agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is making good progress on achieving all its targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government programme.  We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s approach has been set out in the comprehensive expenditure report 2012-14, published on 5 December last; the capital infrastructure plan published on 10 November 2011; the implementation body publication of the public service agreement progress report on 17 November 2011; and the public service reform plan also published on 17 November 2011.</P>
        <P>The public service reform plan published last November outlines the priority actions and timeframes for reform.  Implementation of the reform plan is being overseen by the reform and delivery office established within my Department, which is co-ordinating the various reform initiatives.  Good progress is being made in the implementation of the reform plan.  For example, we are rolling out the public service card for government services, expanding e<i>-</i>government through the recently published e-government strategy, increasing the use of shared services and aggregated procurement under the supervision of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is sitting beside me, and we are rationalising the number of Government bodies to achieve efficiency savings.</P>
        <P>Ireland is living up to its end of the bargain by delivering on all the conditions and targets set out in the EU-IMF programme by the required deadlines.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the sixth quarterly review is currently taking place.  It would be premature at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of these discussions but I am satisfied that Ireland is meeting all the conditions and targets of our programme, including all reform and expenditure targets.  The Government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to meeting the targets agreed with our European and IMF partners.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is responsible for the conservation, care and maintenance of approximately 780 national monuments, which are in State ownership or guardianship.  The conservation and presentation of these monuments involves a mixture of activities including major and minor conservation projects, works to facilitate or improve the presentation and interpretation of sites and ongoing maintenance.</P>
        <P>Twenty-one major projects, each one estimated to cost in excess of &euro;100,000, involving conservation works in regard to the preservation of national monuments, will be undertaken in 2012.  Examples of these projects include work at Ennis Friary, Nenagh Castle, Askeaton Castle and Ormonde Castle.  A full list of major projects, including the programmed expenditure, can be provided to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>OPW-managed sites attract 3.5 million visitors per annum.  In order to enhance the visitor experience, a range of services are provided including interpretative centres, parking facilities, improved universal access, flood-lighting and interpretive panels.  Minor works and ongoing routine maintenance will continue during 2012.  These are part and parcel of the ongoing annual programme.  The budget allocation for the maintenance of national monuments in 2012 is &euro;14.73 million.  The visitor services budget, which covers the cost of providing guide services at 69 individual national monuments, is approximately &euro;7.4 million this year.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the information provided to date.  I would welcome the full list he stated could be provided.  He noted there were guides at 69 sites throughout the country.  At how many of these do people have to pay to enter?  The Minister of State might give the House that information.  I agree with him there is great tourism value and that is why I highlighted this issue.  I encourage him to continue in this area with whatever expenditure is possible.  I draw his attention specifically to the Rock of Dunamaise in County Laois.  I saw in my local paper that the Minister of State may have visited this site last year.  He might speak about the structures-at-risk fund which concerns protected structures that may not be national monuments.  I am not sure which Department disburses that fund, the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department or the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  There are also grants through the Heritage Council.  Between what the Minister of State is spending, the structures-at-risk fund that is given out through local authorities from whichever of the two Departments, and the Heritage Council grant, can the Minister of State return with a figure for the global spend?  He may not have that information today.  There are sums going here and there and it would be very useful to ensure there is full rationalisation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the famous cross of Durrow, a fantastic artefact in his constituency, will again be on full public view from next Monday.  It has been transferred from the graveyard into the wonderful church in Durrow.  That is an example of the ongoing conservation work carried out by the Office of Public Works.  At 50 of the 69 sites, we pay in.  One of the initiatives I launched is the free first Wednesday every month.  It has been an enormous success and has increased the number of people attending these sites all over the country by 50% on the Wednesdays in question.  We will look at how we can extend the initiative this year.</P>
        <P>Grants to the Heritage Council and others are provided by other Departments.  Our responsibility is for the 7,500 monuments, of which 69 are guided, and all historic properties, such as Kilmainham, Farmleigh and Dublin Castle.  In a tight budgetary environment, we are attempting to maximise our spend.  Later this month and over the summer we will launch an important voluntary participation programme, whereby we encourage new partnerships between local communities and the Office of Public Works to help us run and present these fantastic sites.  It will be similar to the model used by English Heritage.  There is great potential in asking local volunteers to help us in the preservation of these sites.</P>

	<P>In June, 2011 the Government took two significant steps on the payment arrangements of CEOs in commercial State bodies.  First, we introduced a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum in the case of newly appointed CEOs in commercial State companies, along with reductions to similar appointees in such companies with lesser pay ceiling levels.  Second, we sought voluntary reductions in the remuneration levels of serving CEOs with salaries in excess of &euro;250,000 per annum.  The sole exception is in respect of the newly appointed CEOs is in the ESB, for whom a salary was approved which is proportionate to the reductions imposed generally. </P>
        <P>The position in respect of already serving CEOs is that for contractual reasons the imposition of reduced salary rates could not be unilaterally proceeded with by Government.  However, incumbent CEOs in the commercial State companies with a salary in excess of the general salary ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum were requested to make a voluntary waiver of salary of 15%, or to waive a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would have brought their salary below the &euro;250,000 salary ceiling.  All of the relevant incumbent CEOs whose salaries were in excess of &euro;250,000 per annum agreed to the application of the waivers.</P>
        <P>The current system of performance-related award schemes for the CEOs of commercial State companies is being reviewed in conjunction with the relevant overseeing Departments in order to consider whether it would be appropriate to amend the operation of these schemes and to provide for more direct input and oversight by Ministers.</P>
        <P>With regard to CEOs of non-commercial State agencies, in June 2011 the Government introduced a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 per annum for future appointments in the public service.  This ceiling continues to apply.  The policy could not, for contractual reasons, be applied to incumbents.  A voluntary waiver of salary of 15%, or the ceiling of &euro;200,000, was requested.  Only a small number of such bodies continue, as they are legally entitled to do, to operate performance-related award schemes for their CEOs.  The remuneration of CEOs in both the commercial and non-commercial State sectors has undergone significant reductions.  Future policy developments on the determination of remuneration at the level of CEO will require ongoing consideration in the light of the changes that have already been introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>The question was specifically related to State agencies, not commercial ones.  I am working on the supposition that premium payments and allowances made to State agencies&rsquo; CEOs are under review.  Can the Minister tell us the total bill to the Exchequer in respect of payments to CEOs of State agencies?  I am not referring to commercial bodies.</P>
        <P>Will the pay ceiling apply to the CEO of the new water utility?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reviewing premium pay and performance-related pay and I do not have a closed mind.  For some, the idea of performance-related pay or bonuses is entirely acceptable in the private sphere but unacceptable in the public sphere.  I do not subscribe to that idea.  It is not appropriate in the Civil Service but there may be some commercial companies where performance-related pay is worth examining.  In that context, I am reviewing performance-related pay generally.</P>
        <P>I can provide the Deputy with the pay rates that currently apply to every State agency in written form.  The pay rate for the new chief executive of Irish Water has not been determined but, as of now, it will sit under the stewardship of the infrastructure in place of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>Under Paragraph 1.16 of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, the implementation body is required to carry out an annual review of the sustainable savings generated from the implementation of the agreement and of the agreements in each sector.  The body carried out its first such review last year and published a detailed first annual report last June.  The period under review related on that occasion to the first year of operation of the agreement &mdash; 1 April 2010 to the end of March 2011.  </P>
        <P>The body&rsquo;s report was comprehensive and robust, providing a detailed account of the sustainable savings that had been achieved under the agreement to date.  It is worth recalling that the report estimated sustainable pay bill savings in the order of &euro;289 million were achieved in the first year.  In addition, examples were provided of administrative efficiency or non-pay related savings of some &euro;308 million.  Furthermore, the report outlined in some detail the progress being achieved on implementing the change and reform agendas as set out in the action plans in place in each sector.  The body also provided a frank assessment of the progress made in the first year, concluding that &ldquo;solid and measurable&rdquo; progress was being made during the implementation year plan.</P>
        <P>The second annual review of the agreement by the body is currently under way and, as before, this review will examine the extent of savings and reform that have been achieved under the framework of the agreement in its second year.  The relevant review period is 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012.  The exact structure and content of the implementation body&rsquo;s report arising from this review is a matter for the body itself under its independent chair.  I look forward to receiving the report and I expect it will be published in June 2012.  I take a very close interest in the implementation of the public service agreement.  I meet with members of the implementation body, including meeting them with the Taoiseach, and am due to do so again shortly.  It is also worth emphasising that officials in my Department are integrally involved in overseeing implementation of the agreement in their capacity as members of the implementation body.  The secretariat to the body is also provided by my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to take up the issue of the Croke Park agreement in subsequent meetings.  I am being kind when I described the format and content of the original annual report as unsatisfactory.  We let it go but only two sentences mentioned the saving of &euro;300 million.  At the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, we told Mr. Fitzpatrick that we want to see savings broken down by Department.  We want to see the detail because it is not good enough in the public interest to give an overall figure.  Perhaps the Minister can give us the method by which he will assess the report.  It is possible that the report will be a good one.  However, can the Minister envisage a situation where he says it is unsatisfactory if it is so?</P>
        <P>Many of the savings have nothing to do with the Croke Park agreement.  The reduction in public service numbers was changed by the incoming Government, of which Deputy Howlin is a member, when it took office last year.  I would say the savings were as a result of a Government decision rather than as a result of the implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to explain which savings come under the Croke Park deal and which savings were achieved in the public service outside of the Croke Park deal.  Somehow or other, these are always aggregated as being part of the Croke Park deal.  Will the Minister tell us which category of savings did not come under the deal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Deputy&rsquo;s criticism of the format of the first annual report last year and I take note of it.  I know that Mr. Fitzpatrick met the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and I suppose that point was made to him there.  We look forward to seeing the nature and content of the next report and I note what Deputy Fleming has said.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the point that some of the savings that are not encompassed by the Croke Park agreement are calculated within it.  Although as an incoming Government we have revised the numbers reduction targets upwards, all of that had to be done within the existing public service.  It was the capacity of the Croke Park deal to allow redeployment to deal with stress points that made the additional downsizing possible.  Therefore, I would not say that was a Government decision that had nothing to do with the Croke Park agreement.  The entirety of the framework that gives us flexibilities to operate public services in a new and imaginative way, to move people, to have shared services and to do all of the things in our reform agenda are attributable to the Croke Park deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>We had the implementation body for the Croke Park agreement before the Committee of Public Accounts recently and I found it interesting that there were no members of the private sector on that body.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on that?  Does he think it necessary to have someone from the private sector or someone not directly affected by the outcomes and the work of the implementation body appointed to it?  Otherwise, we cannot avoid the potential risk of bias, objective or subjective, in reviewing the work and outcomes of the body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The normal way of implementation within the workforce is to involve employers and the workers.  An external person who has nothing to do with the process has nothing to do with it normally.  The employers &mdash; my Department &mdash; are represented and the workers are represented through their unions and an objective outcome is demonstrable.  If any of their presentation is not robust, that can be checked.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if recent discussions with the troika have impacted on the timetable for the proposed sale of State assets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[20280/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government remains committed under the EU-ECB-IMF funding programme to outlining in detail for the troika, by the end of the second quarter, end of June 2012, the specific regulatory, legislative, corporate governance and financial reforms which need to be taken in 2012, ensuring consistency with relevant EU legislation where necessary, to allow for the asset sale programme to proceed in 2013, and a calendar with indicative timelines for sales will be set out.  The issues requiring resolution having already been identified by the end of the first quarter, work is ongoing in the relevant Departments and agencies on considering how they should be addressed in order to facilitate the launch of sale transactions in 2013. </P>
        <P>Nothing has arisen during the troika&rsquo;s current mission that affects this timetable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>We mentioned the national lottery licence earlier and I would consider that to be a State asset.  Does it come under the remit of these discussions and if not, why not?  Is the troika happy the sale of the licence should proceed?  I would consider it as much a State asset as some of the other assets being sold.  On several occasions Ministers have said there will be no fire sale of State assets.  However, twice in his response the Minister mentioned sales will commence next year.  There is no guarantee that we will not remain in a fire sale situation next year.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s position with regard to the timetable for sales if global economic conditions are not suitable for a sale of assets next year?  Has the troika a problem with moving the sale out for a further 12 months?  If State assets are to be sold, everybody here wants them to be sold at the best possible price in the interest of the taxpayer, rather than a quick sale in the interest of the European Central Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raises two points.  I would welcome his support for not including the national lottery licence in the asset sales being discussed.  The troika has not discussed this with me.  I announced this in the context of the capital programme last year because I want to use the bulk of the up-front payment to pay for the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I do not want that dislodged and would welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s support for maintaining that income stream to build the hospital.</P>
        <P>With regard to beginning sales of assets next year, that will not constitute a fire sale.  The first reason for this is that we have done our due diligence.  The main asset to be sold is the energy generating division of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  We know, because we have done our due diligence, that there is significant interest in the market for that.  I have indicated twice to the House, and I do so again now, that we will sell nothing that does not present fair value to the taxpayer in terms of market price.  If market conditions change remarkably between now and next year &mdash; I do not envisage they will &mdash; we will have to think again, because we will not sell any asset that does not accrue fair value to the State.  I assure the Deputy of that.  Judging by the due diligence we have already conducted, there is significant interest.  I agree, however, that until one tests the market with a product, one is not certain of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s concern about the fixed timing of the sale and the potential of it being a fire sale.  The majority of people do not want to see a selling off of the family silver.  I understand that the Labour Party had its party conference in the past week or so and that the party took a fairly trenchant view with regard to the sale of State assets and was against that.  Has that influenced the Minister&rsquo;s thinking and is there any chance that the position of the delegates to the Labour Party conference will prevail in Government policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will be no question of selling off the family silver.  From the beginning, we have said that we negotiated a programme for Government with Fine Gael.  I am responding to questions here as a member of the Government, not as a Labour Party Member.  The Labour Party makes up one third of the Government and we negotiated a programme for Government which includes a sale of State assets and that programme was overwhelmingly approved by the Labour Party conference and by Fine Gael through its validation process.  That is the agreement we will work towards.</P>
        <P>The view of members of my party comes as no surprise to me.  I have a firm attachment to State assets and a firm appreciation of the role State companies have played in the generating of our economy.  We will continue to ensure that the State sector plays a vital part in the generation of new jobs.  It is for that reason the biggest State company of recent times was announced last week by the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>I met with the troika delegation on 17 April together with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and a number of senior officials from our Departments.  The purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on how the programme is progressing in terms of meeting our targets since the previous quarterly review.</P>
        <P>This is the troika&rsquo;s sixth quarterly review and the primary focus is to evaluate our performance against the targets set for the end of the first quarter of 2012 and to assess progress on targets due in the coming quarter.  There has been a series of meetings held with the troika to appraise all the elements of the programme covering fiscal developments, the macro-economic outlook, progress on commitments regarding restructuring the financial sector and structural reform.  These meetings will conclude on Thursday, 26 April with a further meeting between the principals, Minister Noonan and myself.</P>
        <P>Verification of the relevant quarterly targets forms a key part of the mission and the Government has repeatedly stated that meeting these conditions on time and on target is the best way to ensure we emerge successfully from this programme, which is our primary focus.  It is important to build confidence in the State&rsquo;s ability to manage its debt and deficit to enable us to return with confidence to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible.  This is one of the principal objectives of the programme.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the programme does not stop us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme.  We have already done this successfully and the Government will continue to do so at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>Following each review mission, and arising from detailed and lengthy discussions with the troika team during it, revised versions of the programme documents, including the memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality, are prepared by officials of my Department and the Department of Finance along with officials from the Central Bank in conjunction with the external partners.  It would be premature at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of these discussions, but I am satisfied there will be a positive outcome to the review.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that the relevant programme documents are made publicly available at the end of the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he discussed the macroeconomic outlook with the troika.  The discussions are continuing until Thursday.  Is there any recognition on the part of the troika, given the deteriorating economic situation in Europe, the fact that this is the third quarter in a row with economic contraction across Europe and there has been a return of the debt crisis, that its austerity agenda is not working, either here or in Europe, and that alternative strategies need to be considered?  It was reported prior to the meeting that they would discuss in detail so-called labour activation measures.  In his discussions with the troika either at this meeting or at previous meetings, was the decision to cut the lone parent payment once a child reached the age of seven years considered a labour activation measure?  Lone parents maintain that the plan to cut off payments after the child has reached the age of seven years will, in fact, drive lone parents out of the workplace and into full dependency on social welfare.  Was this matter discussed with the troika?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the macroeconomic situation was discussed with the troika.  We discussed the specific details of our own economy and also the position of this economy within the European context and in the global context, which is very important.  The objective of this programme is to get us back to normal funding.  The Government&rsquo;s yardstick is always the question of whether it is working.  Deputy Boyd Barrett was not here when I replied to the first questions today and described the disciplines we are required to impose upon ourselves because we cannot continue to borrow at our current rate of borrowing.  Even Deputy Boyd Barrett understands this.  However, this is not the complete strategy because it requires other elements.  We need to work towards a balanced budget and a deficit target of 3% by 2015 and a deficit target this year of 8.6%, as a stepping stone towards that target, with a target of 7.5% next year and so on.  Of itself this is important but it is not the only strategy; stimulus is also necessary.  The Government has worked on looking at the areas of stimulus, such as the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the establishment of the NewERA entity and the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund.  We have concluded negotiations with the troika for the use of one third of the proceeds of State assets sales for productive job-creation purposes.  We have also engaged with the pension funds to see if more can be invested here.  A range of initiatives has been devised to stimulate the economy as well as working on the balanced budget approach which we need to do at the same time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only comment that as the austerity agenda is rolled out across the rest of Europe, it is becoming increasingly clear that the damage done to the peripheral countries is now spreading to the core and is completely depressing the European economy in all parts.  It is disappointing if there is not some discussion about the implications.</P>
        <P>I specifically asked the Minister whether cuts directed at lone parents were discussed as so-called labour activation measures.  I refer to the cut in the lone parent allowance once a child has reached seven years.  Was this proposal conceived as a so-called labour activation measure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The troika did not raise that issue with us and we did not raise it during the current round.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government announced over a year ago that it planned to review the domiciliary care allowance in order to reduce costs.  Since then there has been a relentless assault on children with special needs and the domiciliary care allowance and this is unacceptable and wrong in my view.  As a result of the reviews to date, nearly 50% of children with autism and with serious special needs have lost their payments.  There seems to be a deliberate premeditated pattern of focusing on children with autism and removing their domiciliary care allowance.  I doubt if there is a Deputy in this House who has not encountered parents of children with special needs, and, in particular, parents of children with autism, who have lost the domiciliary care allowance.  I refer to a most insulting comment contained in the letter which has been received by parents which states: &ldquo;The needs of your child are no greater than the need of any average six year-old.&rdquo;  Parents of children with autism and with special needs generally regard this statement, which emanates from the Minister for Social Protection and the Department, as incomprehensible.  It betrays a lack of any idea of what issues and challenges are faced by a child with autism in his or her life.  These challenges are multiple.  For some reason, these children have been targeted in this review of the domiciliary care allowance.  When this cut is combined with the cut in the family income supplement and in the carer&rsquo;s allowance, I assure the Taoiseach this is having a devastating impact on the families concerned.  Will the Taoiseach initiate a root and branch change to the manner in which the domiciliary care allowances are being reviewed throughout the length and breadth of the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Martin that I can empathise with every parent in the country who has a challenge and a changed set of priorities once it becomes obvious to them that a child born to them or under their care has a particular set of problems.  As Deputy Martin is well aware, the vocabulary changes entirely and also the entire emphasis of a family changes in respect of what might be the best possible support base for each individual child.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Social Protection has commissioned a report into the domiciliary care allowance.  In light of that report, the Minister, no more than anyone else, is always anxious to have the best possible support put in place for every child.  It would be wonderful to be able to assume we had unlimited funds to deal exclusively&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is on the wrong issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the range of problems that affect children.  I know from my own experience that parents of children who are deemed to be on the autistic spectrum can face a range of difficulties, some of which create significant challenges.  However, some children progress very well and I refer to young people who have been categorised as autistic and who have graduated from third level colleges.  It is therefore a case of continuously looking at what is in the best interests of each child.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about having a root and branch analysis of the domiciliary care allowance, which has grown over the years to broad proportions.  I will certainly communicate what the Deputy has said to the Minister for Social Protection who is anxious to have allowances that are most effective in the interests of those they serve, as well as for their parents.  I do not disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the need for an ongoing assessment of the nature, scale and effective quality of these kind of allowances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has missed the point completely.  The issue is not about the review of payments at the age of 16 that the Minister has initiated.  I am talking about children as young as four to eight years of age whose domiciliary allowances are being taken from them because of desk-top reviews.  I met the parents concerned outside the gates of Leinster House this morning and I have also met them in my constituency.  They say there have been no face-to-face meetings with medical personnel or other specialists.  I have seen reports of individual children with consultants and specialists on autism which identify the range of challenges they face.  The Taoiseach is out of touch with these issues.  The Minister has refused to meet with the parents concerned.  They said again this morning that they have met no Government Ministers despite requests.</P>

	<P>They were due to meet the Minister for Social Protection but 20 minutes beforehand they were advised that the meeting would not go ahead.  I am not talking about a review, I want a change of policy.  Since this system moved from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection it is clear there is a deliberate policy afoot to target children with autism by removing their domiciliary care allowance entitlement.</P>

	<P>The chorus is very strong today.  I reject that charge.  As the Deputy is well aware, there is an evaluation process for every entitlement.  If he is talking about a review of the evaluation process, that is always taken into account.</P>

	<P>That is fine.  I meet others around the country regularly but I did not meet that group today.  I have no objection to receiving that material from the Deputy and we will respond to it.  I want the Deputy to understand, however, that I do not at all accept the question of deliberately targeting autistic children.  Over many years, there has been an evaluation process for every entitlement or allowance given.  I would be happy to ask the Minister for Social Protection to respond to the correspondence the Deputy has been given.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the straightest answer I ever got.  I also understand that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s birthday wish is to be the Taoiseach who regains Irish sovereignty.  Yet the austerity treaty he is supporting means handing away more and more sovereignty to unelected officials in Europe.  T&aacute; an conradh seo lochtach, t&aacute; a fhios ag an Taoiseach sin.  Baineann s&eacute; go hioml&aacute;n le austerity agus is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil maitheas ar bith sa chonradh do na daoine.  As the Taoiseach will know, that is the view of more and more opinion makers in this State and across the European Union.  There is nothing in the treaty to stimulate growth or job creation.  When the current bailout programme ends, and if the treaty goes through, it will mean a further &euro;6 billion worth of austerity for Irish citizens.  It will mean more cuts to front line education and community services, as well as more stealth taxes like the household charge, septic tank charges and water charges.</P>
        <P>Today is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s birthday and I understand that it is also the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s birthday.</P>

	<P>The leaders of that Republic proclaimed &ldquo;the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies&rdquo;.  So how does the Taoiseach square the principles of the Proclamation with the treaty, which will put control of Irish destinies into the hands of unelected officials in the European Court of Justice and the European Commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First of all, I am grateful to Deputy Adams for his generosity in recognising that we all have birthdays.  In this Government, there are two such occasions on this date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Two for the price of one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that my emergence into the world occurred on the same April date when, in 1916, those who emerged from the ruins of the GPO declared the Proclamation as the country took its first fledgling steps towards economic and political independence.  I remind Deputy Adams that the first article of this treaty says its purpose is to bring about stability and growth.  I do not share Deputy Adams&rsquo;s view on this at all.</P>
        <P>On many occasions in the coming weeks, Deputy Adams and I will be in close proximity to each other in terms of arguing for and against this treaty.  I will be asking Deputy Adams about the consequences of the vote he is proposing.  He has not spelled out for anybody where this country will get its investment from or how public services will be paid for.  Deputy Adams&rsquo;s proposition would be a slap in the face for Irish workers.</P>
        <P>Week after week, I see strong lines of investment coming into this country.  They are coming here because the companies and plants that decide to invest in Ireland have confidence in our country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They also have confidence in our workforce and people generally.  They recognise that, even with the underlying Eurostat figures, this country is heading in the right direction.  I am happy that Europe has responded to, amongst others, this Government&rsquo;s promptings for an agenda of growth, jobs, investment and career opportunities.  That is where we want to be.</P>
        <P>On 31 May, the electorate must be fully informed about what this treaty actually does and what it is not about.  When they make their decision, they will be voting on the future of our country.  It is our decision alone; it has nothing to do with the elections in the Netherlands, regional elections in Germany, Serbia or Greece, or the outcome of the second round of the French presidential election.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s decision alone.  We cannot prevent this fiscal treaty from moving forward.  Some 25 EU countries have signed on for it and will all ratify it.  We choose to do so by referendum.  The Government and others who support the referendum, will see to it that the people are given the fullest information about the critical decision they must make.</P>

	<P>I cannot let the Taoiseach&rsquo;s birthday pass without paying credit to his greatest achievement, which is to get the Labour Party leadership to agree to this agenda.  In Brussels, Labour Party MEPs voted against measures that are now part of the austerity treaty.  One described austerity as a recipe for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.  Another, Mr. Proinsias De Rossa&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the T&aacute;naiste of Deputy Adams&rsquo;s good wishes to him also.  For a long time I have been a proponent of the argument that the agenda of Europe needs to focus on investment, growth, jobs and career opportunities.  As I stated, I am very glad Europe has responded to my promptings on behalf of the Government and the people and the promptings of other Prime Ministers to do the same.  The next meeting will deal with youth unemployment and the June meeting will deal with small and medium enterprises.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They will all be gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact of the matter is that we are borrowing &euro;16,000 million and there is only one source for it which has set down conditions for the money.  We cannot continue not dealing with this problem.  Deputy Adams seems to ignore this.  Whether one has troika analysis or not we must deal with the problem here, and this is about good housekeeping and putting in place rules, conditions and regulations that will not allow in future the type of activity we had the past.  We are not going back there.  We want to see, and I am sure Deputy Adams does also even from his political perspective, that we run our affairs properly and in order like any household in the country and where we are spending much more than we are taking in we have a problem.  In this sense the treaty is not an end to prosperity in itself; it is but one mechanism on the path to dealing with a return to growth of the European economies and the capacity of other economies to purchase.  We export 80% of what we produce.  In that sense the condition is that we must sort out our own problems ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Taoiseach not vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  Let us sort out our problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Long before this referendum became a reality the Government set out its view that we should legislate for good rules, proper housekeeping and good discipline here that would not allow this to happen again.</P>
        <P>I meet companies such as PayPal, Eli Lilly, Baxter and Microsoft who invest here week after week.  Last week, Mylan Corporation had &euro;500 million on the line for jobs in Baldoyle and Galway.  They invest because they have confidence in our country and people and we want to keep this confidence very strong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>As was mentioned earlier, today outside the D&aacute;il the parents of special needs children who have had domiciliary care allowances cut were protesting as were lone parents who are threatened with a cut in the one parent family payment when their children reach the age of seven and who believe it will drive them out of work.  More generally, these protests are part of a growing revolt throughout Europe against the failed policies of austerity and cuts.  In recent weeks we have seen massive demonstrations and strikes against austerity in Spain, Italy and Portugal.  Now in France, Austria and the Netherlands governments are being rejected by the people because of their attempts to impose the failed and disastrous policy of austerity.</P>
        <P>The latest EUROSTAT purchasing managers index figures show bond yields increasing in Spain and Italy with stock markets panicking.  All of this indicates the agenda of austerity is not working and is strangling the European economy with debt.  Against this background why, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, is the Government promoting a treaty that will demand, in order to meet its targets, even more cuts and austerity being imposed on the people of the country?  If the Dutch economy, which is one of the strongest economies in Europe, is unwilling and unable to impose EU austerity targets and cuts, how on earth can our traumatised and damaged economy sustain the level of cuts and austerity that would be required to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House and the public how much precisely in terms of cuts will be required to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty if we exit the troika programme in 2015?  Estimates suggest it will require &euro;6 billion at least to meet the deficit targets and in the region of &euro;4.5 billion annually for a decade or more to reach the debt to GDP ratio targets.  This level of cuts will destroy our economy and society.  If the Taoiseach disagrees with this, will he tell us how much in cuts will be necessary to meet the targets if we endorse the treaty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Boyd Barrett is fixated by austerity and cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am traumatised by them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He seems to assume the only role and responsibility of government is to involve itself in this.  We have made the point on many occasions that the big difference here will be growth and economic development.  This is why the Government set out to retain the structure of the business models we have put in place with no increase in income tax and no increased taxes on jobs and work and an action plan that is now being implemented with 270 proposals to open the gates for business and small business to get on the road for employment, retention of employees and increasing productivity and exports.</P>
        <P>On my recent visit to China almost 100 companies were in the business of signing contracts for exports which will mean jobs in this country.  As I said to Deputy Adams, while there are difficulties in every country in Europe, since last April I have been pointing out that the road to the future is a balance between good housekeeping which we must do here ourselves and having the single market grow to its potential.  This means being more competitive, cutting costs and shaving excess where it exists.  This is evident in the decisions of the Government to increase research, innovation and development funds so opportunities for careers and jobs can take place.  I invite Deputy Boyd Barrett to listen to the voices of workers throughout the country who are in the position now, who can see their companies and firms beginning to grow and who can see these opportunities.  Every country will always have political difficulties and Prime Minister Rutte explained at Council meetings on a number of occasions the difficulty he has had in holding together a coalition government of a number of parties.  This is our decision here, where there is a stable Government focused on the priority of its people of dealing with our public financial problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Be careful, Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and making jobs and opportunities a real priority.  The minority parties in the Netherlands may well decide to form another Government.  The Queen has asked the Prime Minister to look at that.  If not, and it has to hold an election, that is its decision.  Regardless of what the French, German regional or Greek voters do, our people have to make their decision on 31 May.  I must ask &mdash; it is my privilege to do so &mdash; for their authorisation to ratify this treaty, which sends out a message around the world of continued confidence in this country and our people, which is something on which Deputy Boyd Barrett should reflect in his constituency where there are many people employed in good jobs who do not want to see anything damage the level of confidence there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.  Is there no recognition on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s part, as there is across Europe, that the austerity agenda is not working?  It is crippling growth.  The latest EUROSTAT figures indicate that the debt crisis has returned with a vengeance.  I specifically asked the Taoiseach if he could clarify for the House and the public what cuts will be necessary from 2015 onwards when we have exited the troika programme in order to meet the targets and requirements of the fiscal treaty, which requires us to cut our debt in half which, in turn, will require &euro;4.5 billion in cuts annually for approximately 20 years and approximately &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion in cuts to meet the deficit targets after 2015.  If those figures are not correct, can the Taoiseach give us the correct ones?  Surely, the Taoiseach is not going to tell us that more brutal cuts and austerity will not be needed from 2015 onwards, which agenda is destroying the European economy.</P>

	<P>Answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is perfectly obvious to everyone that 440,000 people on the live register, of which approximately 130,000 may be working part time, is far too many.  The Government has set out its programme and plan to deal with that.  Last week, we published the firstly quarterly report of the Government&rsquo;s action plan to improve the atmosphere in the environment in which jobs and opportunities can take place.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s figures project a view that Government is only about austerity and cutting back.  As I stated earlier to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we must deal with our problems because no one else will deal with them for us.  The economic growth and agenda set by Government is based on creating jobs and job opportunities.  If the Deputy cannot acknowledge that Paypal, Eli Lilly, Microsoft, HP, Baxter, Allergan and many other companies are making serious investments in this country, resulting in the creation of a serious number of jobs, then he is living on a different planet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I advised the House last May of my intention to continue with the process of dialogue between Government and churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations that was inaugurated in February 2007.  Last summer, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of many of the partners in this dialogue to convey directly this interest.  I also arranged in late July for a suggested framework to be sent to dialogue partners for consideration.</P>
        <P>Contacts and dialogue with the various churches and bodies have continued at official level.  I am aware that several invitations have been received in relation to community meetings, for which I am most appreciative and I hope to be in a position to accept at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the amount of time, necessarily devoted to the current economic situation in the country, has unfortunately limited my capacity to engage in other matters.  I can however, assure the House, Ceann Comhairle, that I am deeply committed to this process and I hope to arrange meetings soon with dialogue partners.</P>
        <P>The structure for dialogue will include meetings at official and ministerial level.  The agendas for these meetings will be agreed in advance with each dialogue partner.  The process of structured dialogue was envisaged from the outset as a channel of consultation and communication on matters of mutual concern, but not to displace or override the normal arrangements for the conduct of policy and administration by Government Departments and agencies in their functional responsibility.</P>
        <P>Meetings may be sought by either side on the basis of a proposed agenda and arrangements in this regard will be made by my Department, which will provide the administrative support for the process.  My intention remains that the process of dialogue will develop in the years to come to be a very valuable support in dealing with issues of change in society and I am confident that the opportunity to exchange perspectives and address issues of mutual concern in this way will be of great benefit to all the participants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have two questions for the Taoiseach, the first of which relates to reports that the religious orders have only handed over a fraction of the agreed amount of compensation in respect of abuse committed by their members.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag lorg eolais faoi sin.  An bhf&eacute;adfadh an Taoiseach a r&aacute; leis an Teach an st&aacute;das a bhaineann leis seo ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad?</P>
        <P>Second, has the Taoiseach discussed with the representatives of the Church of Ireland the demands for an investigation into the Bethany House scandal?  The Taoiseach will be aware that former residents have criticised the Government &mdash; I agree with them &mdash; for excluding them from investigation.  These people have a right to be treated as any other survivors or victims of institutional abuse.  I ask that the Taoiseach seize the opportunity to right a huge wrong and that he reconsider the Government&rsquo;s decision and ensure that former residents of Bethany House are given the inquiry they deserve and that he deal with the representatives of the Church of Ireland on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked two specific questions.  On the institutions and the extent of the amount paid over by the religious organisations, that matter is being dealt with by the Minister for Education and Skills.  I have previously answered questions on Bethany House and see no reason to change the view stated.  I am of course open to discussing a full range of issues when the meetings with the individual church organisations and groups take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach know if the press reports that only a fraction of the agreed amount of compensation has been handed over are true?  How are the victims of Bethany House treated differently from any other victims of institutionalised abuse?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is under discussion in the Department of Education and Skills.  If the Deputy puts a specific question to the Minister for Education and Skills, I am quite sure he will give the Deputy the most up-to-date details on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply very carefully.  I do not get the sense of any substantial engagement with the churches.  The reply seemed to focus on the process and the framework.  Not long after he took up office, the Taoiseach assured me in this House that he would engage actively with the various churches.  In particular, he assured me that he understood the needs of smaller religious communities and their schools, which are so central to their faith.  I met a number of people from the Protestant churches recently.  I heard at first hand from them about the devastating impact that the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting cuts on smaller schools will have in September.  The policy will have a disproportionately hard impact on minority faith schools.  It is a huge issue not just in the Border counties, but also right across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I met a Church of Ireland bishop in Cork over the weekend.  It is a very serious issue for that church as well.  Can the Taoiseach explain how the Government can reconcile its stated commitment to supporting religious diversity in our society with its attack on the very lifeblood of minority communities?  Can he explain what he has done on foot of the many complaints he has received from minority religions about the targeted impact of these cuts on their schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for dealing with the schools issue and he will do so.  I have received invitations or expressions of interest to meet a number of organisations, including the Islamic community.  I was invited during the Eid visit some time ago to contact the community, at a time that would be appropriate and convenient, to arrange to attend a community evening that it would like to host.  Some of the issues that are likely to be discussed at a bilateral meeting, including education, migration and the recognition of professional qualifications, have been identified in anticipation of such a meeting.  Contacts arising from that visit have continued at an official level.  An invitation to meet the Jewish community arose in the context of a community visit by the newly elected President Higgins and in the margins of the visit by the Speaker of the Knesset.  Obviously, the Jewish community would like to meet the Taoiseach at an appropriate time.  It expects that it might take place in the context of a visit to the Jewish museum.  Contact has continued with the Humanist Association of Ireland from time to time.  The Church of Latter-Day Saints has been in contact with the Department.  It is hoped that we will have a meeting at official level shortly.  The Church of Ireland has been in contact with the Department.  It has suggested that a meeting be arranged in due course to discuss a number of issues.  It might be more relevant for it to have meetings with individual Departments, depending on the issue to be raised.</P>
        <P>The agreed arrangements are that officials will engage with the churches on the basis that the secretariat for the State, as a partner in dialogue, will be provided by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The dialogue will be arranged in a way that does not displace any existing or ongoing consultation or dialogue.  Departments and agencies will continue to recognise and include the churches and the non-confessional bodies as part of consultation practices for policy preparation in relevant areas.  The dialogue will be open, inclusive, transparent and fully in accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution.  The dialogue will be capable in principle of addressing any matter of individual or mutual concern.  The inaugural meeting took place in Dublin Castle when all of this started in 2007.  The Deputy is aware that four meetings &mdash; with the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Jewish community and the Islamic community &mdash; took place prior to the election and the summer recess.  The resumed process involved the Humanist Association of Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends &mdash; Quakers, the Baha&rsquo;i faith, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Orthodox churches.  When I get an opportunity to do so, I will be happy to have meetings with the groups and with the group collectively as I did before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not really addressed the question I asked, which related to his activities on interfaith dialogue.  I asked him to make a statement on the question of any meetings he has had with religious orders.  The bottom line is that it is incomprehensible that the education situation, in so far as it applies to minority religions, would not be a core part of that dialogue.  Has the Taoiseach met the Church of Ireland?  Has he discussed the impact of the changing of the pupil-teacher ratio on small Church of Ireland and Presbyterian schools across the country?  I refer particularly to the impact of such changes on their faith, which is the major issue in many communities across the country.  I respectfully put it to the Taoiseach that if he continues to ignore those who are pleading with him to intervene to stop these targeted cuts, his credibility and that of the Government on the protection of religious diversity will be seriously undermined.  It is a serious issue.  Since the foundation of the State and the enactment of the Constitution, we have always sought to promote diversity and pluralism and to create space and opportunities for minority faiths to prosper and develop.  There is no doubt that the attack on small rural schools and the policy as enunciated will have a detrimental impact on minority faith schools.  That needs to be addressed by the Government.  Has it formed part of the Government&rsquo;s discussions with the churches to date?  Has the Government had a specific meeting with the Church of Ireland or other churches on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>After I met representatives of the churches, the faith communities and the non-confessional bodies, I asked officials in the Department to prepare a structured dialogue process.  The aims of the process, which was plenary and bilateral, ministerial and official, and generic and specific, were set out for each of the individual organisations and faith groups.  One of the aims is to achieve mutual respect and understanding between the civil authorities and those who lead our churches, faith communities and non-confessional bodies.  Deputy Martin pointed out that the groups in question have played a significant role in shaping the ideas, values and identity of our own people.  Another one of the aims of the process is to respect the voice of the major institutions of civil society as a key part of our democratic process.  That was reflected most forcefully in the constitutional treaty for the EU, which recognised the identity and specific contribution of the churches and philosophical and non-confessional bodies.  As the Deputy is aware, that provision complemented the terms of the preamble to the treaty, which acknowledged the inspiration drawn from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe and engaged with the principle of open, transparent and regular dialogue with the churches and non-confessional bodies, which operates under the European treaties.</P>
        <P>There was an acceptance of the need to acknowledge the multicultural reality of a much diverse range of churches and faith communities, compared to that which existed in the past, in order to build better understanding across a more diverse society.  It was agreed that there was a need to give recognition to the fact that embracing difference and diversity can intensify and deepen self-understanding.  There was a focus on ensuring the structural dialogue did not in any sense compromise the principle of democratic accountability for policy.  Finally, it was agreed that there was a need to be alive to the rights and positions of those who do not subscribe to religious faith and have contributed to the development of Irish society from a philosophical basis that does not derive from religious belief or practice.  I set out the principles and aims of the structured dialogue process when I met the groups last year.  The principles in question, which were followed through after they were outlined, are always borne in mind when discussions take place at official level and with the individual organisations, church groups, faith groups and non-confessional groups.  I am very much aware of how sensitive this can be for people and how important it is to them.  The issues with regard to individual school areas, etc., have been dealt with by the Minister for Education and Skills.  When I next meet all the bodies or meet them bilaterally for structured dialogue, these principles will be clearly borne in mind.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point and its importance.  As I stated, it is outlined in the principles we have put in place for structured dialogue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not talking about structured dialogue.  I got very little from this exchange because the Taoiseach has not answered my questions.  This is a very serious issue for those concerned.  Has the Taoiseach discussed the matter with any of the churches and will he agree to meet representatives of the minority religions on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I met representatives of all the churches and bodies together and had that discussion with them.  I met the Archbishop of Dublin and representatives of the Church of Ireland.  I have had occasion to meet others but not in formal session.  I pointed out to the Deputy in my reply that the vast majority of my time, and that of the Government as a whole, is taken up dealing with the economic crisis.  The discussions have continued at official level.  When I get an opportunity &mdash; by June, I hope &mdash; we can resume formally the discussions with the churches, faith organisations and non-confessional bodies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The questions pertain to my recent visit to China and the visit to Ireland by Vice President Xi Jinping in February.  Ireland and China have a strong bilateral relationship.  More than 30 years of diplomatic relations have seen ever-increasing levels of trade, cultural exchanges and growing numbers of students travelling between our countries.  Nevertheless, I believe the additional opportunities available to us from this relationship are enormous.  One of my priorities since taking office has been to highlight these opportunities and to work to deepen further and cement our relationship.</P>
        <P>High-level visits in both directions are an important sign of this developing relationship.  In September 2011, I was pleased to welcome Mr. Zhang Gaoli, a senior member of the Communist Party of China, to Dublin.  As the House is aware, Vice President Xi Jinping and his large accompanying delegation visited Ireland from 18 to 20 February.  Ireland was the only EU member state in his itinerary, which also covered the United States of America and Turkey.  Vice President Xi Jinping confirmed an invitation to me from Premier Wen Jiabao to visit China at the end of March, which I was happy to accept.</P>
        <P>My visit to China on behalf of the Government, coming so soon after the visit to Ireland by Vice President Xi Jinping, which received widespread and positive media coverage in China, was an excellent opportunity to take the relationship to a new level.  The key objective, therefore, of my visit to China from 26 to 29 March was to further develop strong government-level relations between Ireland and China and build upon the successful visit to Ireland by Vice President Xi Jinping.  In particular, I sought to further promote bilateral economic relations and trade with a view to securing greater penetration of Irish exports and investment in China in a range of key areas, including technology, education services, agri-food and financial services, in addition to ensuring that China sees Ireland as an attractive location for investment.  My programme also reflected the Government&rsquo;s efforts to promote Ireland as a location of choice for Chinese students and as a destination for Chinese tourists.</P>
        <P>During my visit, I had a number of high-level political engagements, including with Premier Wen Jiabao, Vice President Xi Jinping and Mr. Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress.  I was also delighted to meet the Mayor of Shanghai.  During these meetings, as in my discussions with Vice President Xi Jinping in Dublin in February, my central message was my desire to develop stronger relations with China at the highest political level, and to promote Ireland both as a source of world-class products and services and as a location for Chinese investment.  I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s potential as a gateway to the European market of over 500 million people and our many strengths such as our young, well-educated workforce and strong capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation.</P>
        <P>I also stressed the potential for increased investment and economic co-operation in key sectors such as education, financial services, culture, tourism, life sciences, cleantech and agri-food.  I stressed the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food produce and raised the issue of accessing the market for Irish beef.  I agreed with the Chinese leaders that our respective administrations would work on accelerating a resolution of this matter.  The culmination of my visit was the conclusion of a strategic partnership agreement that sets out a framework to ensure mutually beneficial co-operation between Ireland and China in a number of important trade and investment areas.  I raised the issue of human rights with Vice President Xi Jinping both during our meeting in Dublin and again in our follow-up meeting in China.  I also discussed human rights during my meetings with Premier Wen Jiabao and Chairman Wu.  I expressed the hope that as China develops, it will be possible for further progress to be made in ensuring that individual rights are enjoyed by all China&rsquo;s citizens, and also emphasised the need for continued dialogue including through EU human rights dialogue.</P>
        <P>The Chinese leaders acknowledged that there is room for improvement in the area of human rights in China, while referencing recent reforms that have been made including measures to lift people in China out of poverty.  During my visit to Beijing, I delivered a keynote speech at Tsinghua University as part of the Tsinghua Global Vision Lecture Series and was honoured to meet the president of the university.  On the trade and investment front, I had a very intensive programme while in Shanghai and Beijing reflecting my objectives to promote bilateral economic and trade relations. I attended business events in both cities organised by Enterprise Ireland and attended by more than 900 Irish company representatives and their Chinese customers and partners.</P>
        <P>I witnessed the signing of more than &euro;35 million worth of contracts and commitments in Shanghai and Beijing during these events.  In addition, a number of significant memoranda of understanding were signed both during Vice President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s visit to Dublin and again during my visit to China.</P>
        <P>Our intensified engagement with China, including high-level visits, with the strategic partnership agreement and the sectoral memoranda of understanding, have put Ireland-China relations on a new level.  The strategic agreement provides a clear and important framework for closer engagement and co-operation in all of the key areas of interest to Ireland.  It is a new and highly significant development in Ireland-China relations.  I am determined to build on the momentum that has been established.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has just returned from a very successful visit to China, during which further important trade and business contracts were concluded.  Further ministerial visits are encouraged for the coming months and we will continue to ensure that we maximise the opportunities for greater trade and investment in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>When it suits the Taoiseach, for rhetorical or political purposes, he talks about his commitment to democracy and his abhorrence of violence.  However, when money and business are at stake, his concern for them goes out the window.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Question Time.  Could the Deputy ask questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said but one sentence on human rights in China.  What did he discuss with the Chinese dictatorship?  Did he raise, for example, the fact that 500,000 Chinese people are in detention without trial?  Did he raise the fact that the Falun Gong, Christians, Tibetans, Uighurs and anybody dissenting politically against the Chinese regime, including poets and writers who criticise it, are ruthlessly dealt with and imprisoned?  China has one of the highest rates of execution and abuse of the death penalty.  Its trials are a joke for people who oppose the regime.  There is a brutal dictatorship in place.  Do morality, the commitment to democracy and concern for human rights go out the window when it comes to business, commerce and profit?  In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s entire speech, he devoted but one sentence to human rights.  What did he discuss?  Where is the morality in developing close relationships with the Chinese regime when it is a brutal dictatorship?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not discuss the question of human rights with the Chinese leaders when Deputy Boyd Barrett and his apparatchiks decided to waylay ordinary people going about their democratic business in Galway, the city of the tribes.  He should be ashamed of himself regarding that kind of conduct.</P>
        <P>My speech contained a number of sentences on human rights.  I stated I raised the issue of human rights with Vice President Xi Jinping during a meeting in Dublin and at our follow-up meeting in China.</P>
        <P>That is one sentence.  I said I also discussed human rights during my meeting with Premier Wen Jiaboa and Chairman Wu.  That is two sentences.  I expressed the hope that as China develops, it will be possible for further progress to be made to ensure individual rights are enjoyed by all China&rsquo;s citizens and I emphasised the need for continued dialogue through the EU-China dialogue on human rights.  That is three sentences.</P>
        <P>The Chinese leaders acknowledged there is room for improvement in the area of human rights in China while referencing recent reforms which have been made, including measures to lift people in China out of poverty.  I referred to this on a number of other occasions.  The Premier himself made the point that dealing with human rights has been central to his ten years as Premier and he pointed out the improvements that have been made to lift Chinese people out of poverty.  The fact there are 800 million people are on the Internet and 400 million bloggers speaks for itself in terms of the scale of the numbers.  However, his central position was that, of course, there are opportunities to improve the human rights position in China.</P>
        <P>As I said, I raised the issue with the leaders here and in China.  The new strategic partnership between Ireland and China, which was signed, reaffirms the commitment of both countries to respect and safeguard human rights and, as indicated in that joint statement, Ireland and China will conduct exchanges of expertise in governance and the rule of law on the basis of equality and mutual respect.  Human rights are a constant and important issue of dialogue and discussion with the Chinese authorities at a European level and at a national level.  We hope that as China develops it will continue to be more open and will ensure individual rights are enjoyed by all of China&rsquo;s citizens.  The Premier was very forthright in his response to my question on this.  Clearly, there is room for improvement in China and it will continue to work in that area.  As far as we are concerned, nationally, we will continue to do that in a bilateral sense at an official level and a formal level and as part of the EU-China dialogue on human rights.  That was part of the discussion which took place.</P>
        <P>In so far as Falun Gong and the individual human rights cases are concerned, as the Deputy is aware, the EU-China dialogue on human rights was established in 1995 and through that, the EU continues to discuss with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion and it continuously urges China to improve its human rights situation.  This broad-ranging discussion has allowed for interaction and engagement on issues like freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, prison conditions, freedom of religion and minority rights.  It is within that framework the EU raises individual cases with China, a process in which Ireland is involved.</P>
        <P>I hope that having raised the matters here and in China with each of the three leaders, the most influential people at the head of the Chinese Government acting on behalf of the Chinese people, that our concern was expressed very clearly.  I noted the very direct response from the Premier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked two questions on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to China, which I welcome.  As he said, a relationship has been developing over 30 years.  He would have to acknowledge also that the Asia strategy of 1999 represented a very significant expansion and upscaling of the nature of the relationship between this country and China.  I recall that back in 1999, two-way trade was worth approximately &euro;500 million.  By 2007-208, I understand it was worth &euro;5 billion.  That is true of many other countries and it reflects what is one of the great stories &mdash; whatever way one wants to put it &mdash; of the late 20th century and the early 21st century, that is, the fundamental change in the nature of the way the globe operates.  The rise of China and India has had a fundamental impact on the world economy and we have yet to fully take on board the full consequence of that.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach raised a number of issues, including the life sciences.  It is important we do not lose sight of our strategic need to continue to invest in research and life sciences.  In the current financial climate, there is a danger that we are not paying the same attention to that as we did over the past decade and that researchers are being lost to the country.</P>
        <P>The intellectual knowledge based approach with China is central.  In that context, did the Taoiseach raise the issue of intellectual property rights, which has always been a very serious one and a bone of contention between Europe and China in terms of the development of products, services, patents and so on, in particular in the area of software and technology?  China has always been interested in a strong relationship with Ireland in regard to software but it would seem the issue of intellectual property has retarded the development of that relationship with people having a certain sense of security around intellectual property rights.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach raise the visa situation or did the Chinese authorities raise it with him in terms of ease of access of Chinese students or educationalists to Ireland?  The whole concept of a tourist visa has been mooted for some time by the last Government and by this one.  Will the Taoiseach outline the up-to-date position in that regard as an important catalyst for the attraction of a greater number of Chinese tourist traffic?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach mentioned the EU-China dialogue on human rights, which is a very important framework and perhaps represents a substantive framework where proper weight can be attached to the issue of human rights as Ireland has a very strong international reputation for its commitment to human rights.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that we have to insist on our right to raise these issues at high level bilateral meetings.  Equally, we must acknowledge that if one was to compare the China of today with that of 30 years ago, there is a marked difference and significant improvement.  We would have to acknowledge progress.  More than half a billion people have been taken out of poverty as a result of the economic growth and progress but much more needs to be done and many questions need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he is committed to retaining Ireland&rsquo;s policy of voting in favour of an assertive human rights platform at the United Nations, in policy and elsewhere, irrespective of trade links or the impact of an assertive human rights policy on trade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1999 Asia strategy was an important development and a recognition of the enormous potential and scope that exists in south east Asia in general with two of the planet&rsquo;s largest populations &mdash; India and China &mdash; which have enormous potential in terms of their economic development in the times ahead and in respect of opportunities for development here.  It puts in context the scale of both populations and the size of the countries.</P>
        <P>In regard to the memorandum of understanding, we did not discuss the detail of the intellectual property rights issue which is conducted on a European scale with China.  However, for the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the strategic partnership agreement set out greater levels of two-way trade and investment between Irish companies and Chinese investors and vice versa and attracting inward investment from China to Ireland which can, in turn, facilitate access to the European Union.  The Chinese were very interested in that in much the same way as the United States availed of Ireland&rsquo;s launching pad status into Europe.  It set out increased co-operation in the areas of science, technology and innovation.  As I pointed out to the Deputy, the budget in respect of these areas was increased despite the economic constraints we are under.  It set out closer collaboration in the agri-sector, including food and agribusiness, and greater levels of cultural and people to people exchanges, including in the areas of education and research.  It set out the opportunity for far closer engagement in that area.</P>
        <P>During the visit of the Vice President here in February and again when we visited China along with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who accompanied me for a portion of that visit, a memorandum of understanding was signed on the promotion of international trade and services, the establishment of a joint investment promotion working group through the China-Ireland Joint Economic and Scientific Commission meeting, scientific and innovation co-operation and international education.  There was also a series of memorandums of understanding in the financial services area between IDA Ireland and China&rsquo;s ICBC Financial Leasing, between the NTMA and the Chinese Investment Corporation and between Enterprise Ireland and CCPIT.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also point out to Deputy Martin that we now have three Confucius institutes here &mdash; in the University of Ulster, where I was last week, in UCD and in UCC.  All of these are working very intensely with their counterparts and one another in respect of what can happen here.  A number of education institutes here also signed memorandums of understanding and agreements with counterparts in China for students in China to do the leaving certificate and for students to come over here and do semesters in our universities.  I might point out that a major Dublin legal firm signed a major agreement with most of the legal firms in China to deal with the question of common law philosophy and how that obtains in Western countries so that, as China expands outside its own shores, these personnel and young lawyers will be well versed in what that actually means.</P>
        <P>From speaking to the people who were there from Ireland and involved in the education business, they were very excited about the opportunities that existed.  I note that, for instance, UCD has a very strong programme of dealing with China, as has UCC.  Students do a semester or a year there as the case might be.  In the context of China and its potential, these links are all there to be developed.</P>
        <P>I might point out that, while we have 30 years of diplomatic relations with China, it was of interest to the premier that, for instance, Michael Davitt, as the leader of the great agrarian movement here in the late 1800s, actually asked questions as an MP in the House of Commons about Sun Yat-sen, who was then one of the political forces able to bind the different groups together.  Following that in 1914, for instance, when the Columban fathers were sat up in Dalgan by Fr. John Blowick from the west of Ireland, they actually baptised their first Chinese child as part of their congregation in 1920.  So, there were other interactions between Ireland and China long before formal diplomatic relations began 30 years ago.</P>
        <P>I have to say that I found it of interest that something that is of real connection with the Chinese people is that sort of culture and tradition that Ireland has had, not just in China but in many other countries.  That is another reason we are one of the few countries to have a strategic partnership agreement with the second largest economy in the world.  Given the challenges that the Chinese people face and given the staggering numbers and potential that exist there clearly for Ireland, there are opportunities both ways and we will do all that we can to foster these developments in the very best way possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree there is great potential to develop our trading links with China and the rest of Asia.  For example, Vietnam is emerging from a difficult time.  We must also be mindful of human rights abuses and there is an onus on the Government and everyone else to raise these issues in a way that can assist their being resolved.  I also have concerns about the plight of the people of Tibet.</P>
        <P>Having said that, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed Vice President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s visit and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s subsequent visit to China.  They were good initiatives.  The First Minister and Deputy First Minister have been part of this engagement and Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness are to travel to China in the autumn.  The maximum amount of co-operation across this island in developing our links and opening up markets would be good for everyone across Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have two questions.  First, Ireland has a global reputation for the production of high-quality food, one aspect of which is its agrifood sector.  I am advised by a number of producers of Irish-processed pork that they are having difficulties getting access to the Chinese market.  I wondered whether this matter arose during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit.</P>
        <P>Second, as the Taoiseach may know, the Chinese firm SATIR is based in Dundalk and plans to invest &euro;30 million and create as many as 200 jobs.  This would represent the largest Chinese investment in our economy to date.  Given the fact that Dundalk has suffered badly from job losses at Diageo and Vodafone, this is good news.  Did the Taoiseach meet representatives of SATIR when he was in China?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a final point.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence.  I understand that there are plans for a trade delegation later this year.  Will the Taoiseach give us some details of that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The trade delegation has not been finalised as yet.  Obviously, there is a great deal of preparation to go into them, but what I am anxious to encourage is a series of ministerial visits.  This is important in the sense of having real programmes to which both weight and respect are attached in terms of being able to do business.</P>
        <P>I actually mentioned on a number occasions that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister from the Northern part of the country would be travelling to China later on in the year.  I referred to that when speaking with the Deputy First Minister recently.</P>
        <P>When I raised the issue of the possibility of Irish beef getting into China with Vice President Xi Jinping, on the following day the premier, Mr. Wen Jiabao, was happy to acknowledge that he had instructed that the process by which this could become a reality would be set in train.  As Deputy Adams is aware, this is a matter that has to be dealt with by scientific analysis and the examination of lesions under laboratory conditions.  It is not just an issue of politics where one can say, &ldquo;Release Irish beef into China&rdquo;, but that process is in train and was endorsed by the interactions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he was there quite recently.  Obviously, UCD has signed a very important strategic agreement arising from the most recent visit of the Minister to China.</P>
        <P>In so far as the global reputation is concerned, we are anxious to have an understanding on the basis of trust with the Chinese people.  They like to think that the Government and Irish people are serious.  They know from their reflections on the kind of country that we are now, those who are working here and those who continue to invest here how important this is.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin raised a question with me about visas.  He is aware that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, changed the rules to be more flexible here.  I have to say that the figures are mind-blowing in the sense that the Chinese have to create 27 million new jobs per year and there are 8 million graduates leaving university each year.  By 2020, they expect that 100 million Chinese people will be travelling on holidays abroad.  The visa waiver function is of great interest to them.</P>
        <P>I also met a number of companies that are interested in and talking about the possibility &mdash; I stress &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; &mdash; of direct flights to Ireland.  Clearly, for Chinese visitors a long layover in Abu Dhabi or Frankfurt for seven or eight hours is a deterrent to a direct flight.  They have got the capacity for that now.</P>
        <P>I am also to meet a number of interested Chinese investors over the period ahead.</P>
        <P>As the trade delegations and ministerial visits harden up, we will be happy to let people know about them so that there may be opportunities for Deputies to suggest one company or another could be considered as well.  To be honest with the Deputy, I am not sure whether I met individual representatives of the companies that he mentioned.  I attended a number of these business organisation meetings and breakfasts at which there were 300 to 400 people.  It was important that they could make contact with the leader while he or she was there.  In that sense I was happy to interact with all of them at some stage.  The list of companies was extensive and some of their representatives travelled out long before the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and me.  We were happy to engage with them and their Chinese colleagues and I witnessed the signing of contracts of interest to Irish companies to the value of at least &euro;35 million.</P>
        <P>I can follow up with the company in Dundalk which the Deputy mentioned.  I am sure it is of interest to the company but the Government is anxious to pursue the matter in a realistic way.  A number of working groups will have to be set up with a direct and realistic engagement with our Chinese counterparts in order to make these things become a reality.</P>
        <P>It was memorable to see the tricolour on every lamppost in Tiananmen Square, which was symbolic of China&rsquo;s engagement with the Irish delegation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should withdraw the suggestion that I was involved in anything that could be described as violent activity in Galway.  That is not true, as was confirmed by David McCullagh from RTE, who was present on the occasion.  It is very dishonest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy deny it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to deploying this sort of dishonest tactic, did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictatorship tactics for dealing with protestors?  Does he know that recently the poet-activist, Zhu Yifu, was jailed for seven years for the terrible crime of inciting subversion of state power?  He faces seven years of incarceration because he wrote the following poem:</P>
        <P LI="1">It&rsquo;s time, people of China!  It&rsquo;s time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictatorship the fact that it is imprisoning poets simply for suggesting that the Chinese might come out on Tiananmen Square to demand their rights to freedom and democracy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a propaganda exercise.  Will the Deputy ask a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am the only person the Ceann Comhairle cut across.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Ask a question because others are asking questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a question.  Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictators the fact that they are putting poets in prison for calling for peaceful protests and demanding democracy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a poet in the &Aacute;ras.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not catch what the Deputy said about his activities in Galway.  He will be welcome the next time if he behaves himself in accordance with proper democratic rules and regulations and does not carry on the way he did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I always behave myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said to Deputies Martin and Adams, I discussed the question of human rights with Vice-President Xi Jinping when he was in Ireland, with Mr. Wu, the Chairman of the party, Premier Wen Jiabao and again with Vice-President Xi Jinping in China.  The Premier was forthright in his response.  He recognised that China has more to do in respect of human rights but he pointed out the improvements that have been made to lift Chinese people out of poverty.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of the individual poem which the Deputy cited and I did not specifically refer to any individual poet who might be imprisoned.  The Deputy will be aware that we negotiate and discuss these matters through proper assemblies.  Since 1971, when Ireland voted in favour of the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognising the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China as the sole legitimate Government of China, it is through this process that the issues of trade and education and all these things, including human rights, are raised.  We will continue to do so from a European point of view, from a national point of view and in a bilateral way when the opportunity arises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the key issues for the future is the two-way relationship in education.  We need to provide more opportunities for students in Ireland to study Mandarin, particularly at second level.  The Confucius institutes have been established but have substantive discussions been entered into with the Chinese authorities regarding a joint programme to facilitate student participation in programmes partially located in China?  To be fair to our universities, the number of students completing third level degrees in Chinese studies and language combined with business and enterprise has increased significantly.  Many are spending a year in Shanghai, Beijing or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There is significant potential for an expansive programme of internships with Irish companies located in China.  From my own experience, however, such an initiative requires a proactive approach on the part of the State in terms of resources and support.  Globalisation demands greater presence of Irish people on the ground in more locations than we have historically been able to manage.  From an economic perspective, that is an important policy plank.  I ask the Taoiseach if he agrees.</P>
        <P>On my last trade mission to China as Minister for Foreign Affairs the Chinese authorities officially granted access to pork and declared that China was open to Irish pork products, although not beef.</P>
        <P>Are there signs of significant interest among the major Chinese global companies in regard to using Ireland as a gateway to Europe?  Did the Taoiseach discuss that issue with Chinese companies and the IDA and Enterprise Ireland with a view to identifying the obstacles to a more significant Chinese presence in the form of multinationals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the memorandums of understanding we dealt with pertained to international education.  The representatives from educational institutes, universities and second level institutes who were on the visit are seriously excited about the possibilities that arise.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Cannon, has decided to learn Chinese and is proceeding to demonstrate that Irish people can master the language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our ambassador to China is the greatest example of all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, the ambassador, Mr. Kelleher, has done a wonderful job and he is fluent in Chinese.  The memorandum of understanding dealing with international education will lead to the substantive joint programme to which the Deputy referred.  The reaction of those involved at university level and in the world of academia in China was strong in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the question of pork, the Chinese will require approximately 700 million pigs this year.  This presents an enormous opportunity.  What has already begun will be followed through and a number of the companies involved in food production are very excited about that.</P>
        <P>I have met representatives of the Chinese Investment Corporation regarding a number of bank investment opportunities and this was followed up by officials during the course of the visit.  The chief executive of the IDA met a series of potential investors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As an unaligned country with wonderful connections all over the globe, we can do a lot to help the understanding of Sino-American relationships.  Ireland is a perfect location for advancement of understanding on a number of issues.</P>
        <P>We will work hard to develop this relationship, including investment in Ireland.  There was interest expressed &mdash; I cannot put it beyond that until persons would move and decide whether to sign on the dotted line &mdash; but also serious potential, which will be followed through, for investment from here in China.  One of the bigger companies is CRC, which is doing exceptionally well in north-eastern China, but I was very happy with the export potential of many of our smaller companies, which are in niche areas and which are doing well.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Martin, there are approximately 500 Irish in Shanghai, and a somewhat similar number in Beijing, between the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Le Ch&eacute;ile group and the chamber of commerce.  All of them are there because they want to be there.  I spoke to a number of young teachers who are out there for a year or two years teaching English in international schools, and it is a broadening of experience for them.  In that sense, it adds to the links between China and Ireland from a young person&rsquo;s point of view which, hopefully, can be developed and fostered during the time ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I may drop the Taoiseach or the appropriate Minister a note on the difficulties of the pork producer, who has been in contact with me, in getting his produce into markets in China.</P>
        <P>I put it in a slightly different way from other Deputies who have spoken on this issue.  I appreciate and understand well Ireland&rsquo;s status and reputation internationally given our history and we are in a unique position to raise these issues of human rights abuses and other injustices, and we must do so.  My view is one does it, not merely for the optics or rhetoric, but in a way which engages and seeks to have the problems resolved and mindful also of the integrity of the nation with which one is dealing.  Obviously, imprisonment without due process of anyone, particularly of dissidents who are only guilty of using free speech or poetry, is something which is to be deplored.  We need to continue raising these matters wherever we come across them, either on this island or anywhere else in the world.</P>
        <P>There are unique opportunities, given that we have a functioning Administration in the North, and given that there is a good relationship between the Government and the Executive, and particularly the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, to ensure the fullest co-operation and joined-up position.  We should not be in competition, one part of the island with another, in seeking to develop these links.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach was open in promoting the visit by the OFM-DFM in the autumn.  In terms of the trade delegation, however, it might be useful to advise as to how such trade delegations would be made up in the future.  If there could be a joint, all-island delegation bringing persons from across the island from whatever sector, whether it is software, high-tech, education, agrifood or whatever, that would be very helpful to our own process here and also, obviously, take best advantage of any opportunities in China.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will continue to raise, without fear or favour, the question of human rights as is right and appropriate, both from an Irish point of view given our long history in that area and also as a member of the European Union.</P>
        <P>I had no difficulty at all in explaining to our Chinese counterparts the relationship that exists between the Government here and the Executive in Northern Ireland and to point out that there would be a delegation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister later on.  I also referred to this at the opportunity to speak at the Chancellor&rsquo;s lecture in the University of Ulster last week.  For instance, tourism is a non-contentious issue and visitors coming to the island of Ireland have the opportunity to sample the wonderful golf courses of Northern Ireland, the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway or the other history and cultural facilities that exist there as they do of the rest of Ireland.  Given the changes in the visa waiver scheme here, as Deputy Adams will be aware, those landing in Britain can come here without the requirement for a visa which makes it all the more opportune for them to do so.  In fact, last week I spoke to Commissioner Tajani who has responsibility for tourism in a European sense and while we have moved some way to being able to get visas online by electronic means, there is consideration for greater flexibility from a European perspective to allow Chinese people to visit Europe, even on a pilot basis.  That is an issue that would affect Northern Ireland as well as the Republic.</P>
        <P>These all are opportunities.  I really want to put out the message that in so far as we are concerned, we will work this agreement hard.  We will have our own working groups interact realistically, credibly and vigorously with their Chinese counterparts in the hope that this can provide jobs and opportunities here with exports to China, and also appropriate consideration for investment in Ireland with a view to expansion of our economy, and into Europe.  These all are issues with which we are happy to deal.</P>
        <P>As I stated in response to Deputy Martin, I see a role for Ireland in a fostering of greater understanding between China and the US on a range of issues.  No doubt that would be of interest to both sides.</P>

        <P Just="Left">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 9 p.m. tonight and shall adjourn on the adjournment of Private Members&rsquo; business, which shall be No. 32 &mdash; Motorist Emergency Relief Bill 2012, Second Stage, which shall take place on the conclusion of No. 10, and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes tomorrow night; No. 9 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 16 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. tonight; and the proceedings on No. 10 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, and who may share their time, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case.</P>

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, without debate, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, Second Stage (resumed) of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, agreed to?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the original draft of the Bill issued, the Bill has been very substantially amended and rewritten and what we are now looking at is a different Bill.  It is not the same Bill as was debated in the D&aacute;il last week.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We are getting less than an hour &mdash; 7.54 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. &mdash; to discuss what is effectively a new Bill with considerable changes, such as the spreading out of social welfare benefits to part-time workers over five days rather than six, which will substantially affect people&rsquo;s incomes, as well as a series of other major changes.  It is not acceptable that what is effectively a new Bill should be discussed for less than an hour and that the Technical Group will not have a chance to speak on it at all.  We will not be able to make any comment on what is effectively a new Bill.  We want to protest in the strongest possible terms.  This is not acceptable, and more time must be allowed on Second Stage to discuss the Bill along with the raft of amendments that change it substantially.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Fleming, who is taking this Bill on behalf of our party, has indicated to me that quite a substantial number of amendments have arrived late in the day and adequate time has not been allowed for discussion of these amendments to allow an understanding of their full implications.  More time is required, given the number of amendments and the lateness of their arrival.  This represents a substantive change to the Bill as discussed on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of section 4 of the Bill, pertaining to single parents and the ending of payments when children reach the age of seven, on which I still have not received a response from the Government with regard to conditionality.  The attachment of conditionality to any Bill coming through the House from a member of the Cabinet, making it subject to the response of other Cabinet members to the conditions the Minister has laid down, is unprecedented.  I would appreciate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on that aspect.  Is it his intention to proceed with section 4 as well as these other amendments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must point out that what we are being asked to agree here is the proposal for dealing with Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  The next proposal, on No. 10, deals with the motion to instruct the committee regarding changes to the Bill.  I say this in case there is any misunderstanding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to oppose proposal No. 4, so I am seeking guidance.  I do not think that 15 minutes per party is enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a condition imposed by Standing Orders.  In order to introduce new amendments to a Bill, 60 minutes must be given for this purpose.</P>

	<P>The Government has introduced many amendments to the Bill, but there are conflicting signals.  The Minister is telling us she does not agree to some key elements of the Bill, yet it is being rushed through this evening.  For all the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attempts to put down Deputy Boyd Barrett, it is totally unacceptable that the Technical Group should not have the right to speak on this, if what the Deputy says is true.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This represents a substantive change to the Bill.  The reason the motion is being tabled is because the amendments introduced were not contemplated by the original Bill.  They were outside the scope of the original Bill and that is not good enough in the context of a debate that is being guillotined on Second, Committee, Report and Final Stages.  This is shoddy treatment of Members of the House by the Government on substantive issues.  The motion on the Order Paper concerns &ldquo;an instruction to the Committee on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 that it has power to make provisions to amend and extend the law relating to the Social Insurance Fund, employed contributors and employment contributions, supplementary welfare allowance, offences, miscellaneous control provisions and proceedings, claims and payments, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, appointments and duties of social welfare inspectors, social welfare, miscellaneous provisions on budgeting, and occupational pension schemes&rdquo;.  This is extensive and it calls for a fundamental reappraisal by the Government of how the Bill is being treated in the House.  Greater opportunity should be provided to Members of the House to give adequate time and consideration to the issues that have come before it in the substantive amendments that were not contemplated by the original Bill.  It is not good enough in terms of procedure and it flies in the face of the commitment to D&aacute;il reform and full engagement with all Members on legislation and propositions from the Government concerning serious issues that go to the heart of people on benefits and payments and their entitlements.</P>
        <P>We have had enough stealth attacks on people on social welfare, particularly single parents.  The domiciliary care issue was raised earlier and we need adequate time in the House to tease out these issues so that people can get to the nitty-gritty and the implications of what is being proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it appropriate that our Whip should deal with this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate because I commend the Ceann Comhairle on seeking an explanatory memorandum.  When this matter arose at the Whips meeting last week, a number of us were aware of the major changes being proposed to a Bill to deal with only two subjects &mdash; the disgraceful change to the entitlements of one parent families and pensions.  The proposed changes are far-ranging and cover 12 areas of social welfare code.  The Government Whip acknowledged that and took the opportunity to table a motion.  However, rather than a motion to discuss the 12 points, in light of the Minister&rsquo;s concerns about the Bill in respect of one parent families, the entire Bill should have been withdrawn and resubmitted with the changes made under the title of a social welfare miscellaneous provisions Bill.  We will have an opportunity to discuss this later.  The opportunity is limited to one hour, which means 15 minutes per grouping to deal with 12 areas of the social welfare code.  The chosen option should have been to withdraw the Bill or extend the time available.</P>

	<P>As I said earlier and as others have said, this is effectively a new Bill.

	<P>They include lone parents, part-time workers and others dependent on social welfare.  It is wrong that what is effectively a new Bill should receive less than one hour of discussion.  It raises the question of what the Government and the Minister were doing when an extension of what the Bill is dealing with comes in at the last minute.  It flies in the face of any commitment to serious accountability and democratic discussion on such an important Bill.</P>
        <P>What is unacceptable in that regard is that all of the groups will not even get the 15 minutes referred to because one section of this House, effectively one third of the Opposition parties, will not have the opportunity to speak at all on Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  As the Minister of State is aware, the qualifying age for both the contributory and non-contributory State pension currently stands at 66 years.  However, the qualifying age is due to rise to 67 years in 2021 and 68 years by the year 2028.  These increases are not unexpected nor are they all that surprising, given the longer life expectancy.  In addition, there is expected to be an increase in the number of retired citizens compared with numbers in the workforce over the coming years.  Therefore, it is important that the State has substantial financial policies in place in advance of this shift.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will also be aware that under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, the State transition pension will no longer be paid after 1 January 2014.  The purpose of the State transition pension is to help those people who are being forced into retirement at the age of 65 years, too early to receive the State pension which is available to them at 66 years.  I ask the Minister of State what assistance will be available to those who continue to be forced into retirement at the age of 65 years, particularly as the qualifying age for the State pension begins to rise.  Is consideration being given to outlaw the practice of mandatory retirement?</P>
        <P>The decades-old practice of forcing workers to retire at the age of 65 years needs to come to an end and this is what will happen.  Government social welfare policy mirrors that belief but I am concerned we have fallen short in legislating for this change in other areas.  Countless employees in this country are currently operating under contracts that permit their employers to force them into retirement once they hit the age of 65.  The outlawing of this practice would ease the concerns of the people facing this situation and it would reduce the overall financial burden on the State by increasing the tax intake resulting from extended working lives.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that if a 65 year-old man or woman were to lose his or her job through forced retirement, it would prove very difficult for them to find further employment.  These people are entitled to apply for social welfare payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance but this is not a realistic solution.</P>
        <P>We are not the first country to face this problem as the UK announced last year that the default retirement age of 65 years was to be phased out.  This change means that employers will no longer be allowed to dismiss staff on reaching the age of 65 years.  I understand that exceptions may need to be made for certain occupations, particularly those involving a great deal of physical effort.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this matter.  Members will be aware of the recent and upcoming changes to the State pension provision which have been announced.  I take this opportunity to explain on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection her reasons for making these changes.</P>
        <P>As Irish society has changed, pensions policy has evolved to reflect these changes.  A key focus has been to ensure that the State pension is sustainable in light of demographic changes.  This is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s primary consideration in making these changes has been to ensure that the system is on a financially sound and sustainable footing.  Ireland is not alone in this regard as all ageing societies in the West face a similar challenge.  The OECD put it well when it stated, &ldquo;Policy-makers are facing the challenge of providing a short-term response to the crisis without losing sight of the longer-term structural reforms needed to put pensions on a solid foot in light of population ageing&rdquo;.   In this context, the Government has asked the OECD to examine current pensions policy to ensure that it meets the needs of future generations.</P>
        <P>The actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will be published in June.  The scheme is in deficit to the tune of &euro;1.5 billion so there will be a significant challenge in putting our social insurance system on a sustainable footing.  This will be an important base line for the assessment of the sustainability of all social insurance schemes, including the State pension contributory.</P>
        <P>We cannot overstate the challenges facing the Irish pensions system.  The population share of those aged over 65 years and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050.  People are living longer and healthier lives, with average life expectancy set to rise even higher in the future, at up to 88 years for women and 83.9 years for men.  The number of older people is increasing.  A total of 11% of the population is currently over 65 years and this is expected to increase to 22% to 26% in the period 2050 to 2060.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid currently.</P>
        <P>In contrast, over the same period, the proportion of the population who are of working age is expected to decline from approximately 68% to 58%.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by mid-century.  Therefore, the task of financing an increasing pension expenditure will fall to a diminishing share of the population who are working.  State expenditure on pensions will increase from approximately 8% of GDP in 2010 to almost 12% in 2060.</P>
        <P>The central objective of the Minister for Social Protection is to reform the system so that it is viable in the future.  If we are to deliver on the social contract to those in retirement, we need people to remain in work for as long as possible so that we can provide the necessary retirement supports.  The abolition of State pension transition in 2014 will go some way towards this objective.  Under current rules, the recipients of State pension transition are not permitted to be in full-time employment.  The vast majority apply for the contributory State pension at age 66 years.  There are almost 300,000 State pension contributory recipients compared to 12,000 State pension transition recipients, many of whom have come from other social welfare schemes.  The standardisation of the State pension ages at 66 years may allow more people to remain at work as there is no barrier to work for those in receipt of State pension at 66 years.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  This is an issue that must be dealt with and the Minister of State has outlined the position that the OECD is to examine the current pension policy.  I ask that the needs of many people be taken into consideration in that examination.  I am happy with the details the Minister of State has given.  If we could get those type of detailed answers to many other questions it would make our lives as public representatives a lot easier.

      <sTitle>Nursing Home Repayment Scheme</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The difficulty last year was that funding for the fair deal nursing home scheme ran out.  It was suspended last June or July creating uncertainties.  Admittedly, a further &euro;50 million was put into the scheme by the Exchequer to ensure it would not run out of funding.  A review is currently under way but reviews by extension lead to uncertainty.  I am concerned this review could drag on for a long period and, therefore, I want to get clarity on what the review will entail.  Is it just a value for money review or is it an overall review of the scheme?  Is it an overall review of how we fund care for the elderly in our communities and society generally.</P>
        <P>As a practising politician, the Minister of State knows the anxiety and concern among people about how they will fund long-term residential care for their elderly loved ones.  Filling out application forms for such subventions years ago put huge stress and strain on families while eating into their savings.  In some cases, their basic ability to function as a family was undermined by funding long-term residential care for relatives.</P>
        <P>While there has been some criticism of it, the fair deal scheme has been transformative in removing uncertainty.  People now know a place will be available for their loved ones when they need long-term residential care.  I am concerned, however, that this review will undermine the good work that was done in the context of establishing the nursing home support scheme and all that stemmed from it.</P>
        <P>While this is not a criticism of the Minister of State or her ministerial colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is there an ideological issue concerning private nursing homes?  Such homes can make a contribution in delivering health care and long-term residential places.  The reduction of 630 private nursing home beds will have a huge impact because there has been no increase in home support schemes or home care packages.  People will not be able to move from the acute hospital sector to an intermediary step-down facility and perhaps on to long-term care, if required.</P>
        <P>A large capacity is being taken out of long-term stay beds, but there is no indication from the Department or from the HSE about how they will find long-term residential accommodation for those who require it.  The demographic increase in our elderly population means that in the short to medium term this issue must be addressed once and for all.  Is the fair deal nursing home review fundamentally a value-for-money review or is there a broader remit to the review group in terms of how we fund such facilities and how we will care for the elderly in future?  Ultimately, the fair deal nursing home support legislation is primary legislation which will have to return to the D&aacute;il for discussion if any amendments are made to it.  The legislation must be effective, quick and we must ensure it does not undermine people&rsquo;s confidence or increase anxiety among those considering long-term residential care or nursing home care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kelleher for raising this issue.  The nursing homes support scheme will have been three years in operation in October and is on schedule to be reviewed this year.  The scheme was introduced in 2009 with the commitment to review its operation after three years.  The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available to inform the work.  The review is now on schedule for this year and is in the course of preparation.  Among other issues, the review will examine the ongoing sustainability of the scheme; the relative cost of public <i>versus</i> private provision; the effectiveness of current methods of negotiating price in private, and setting price in public, nursing homes; and the balance of funding between residential and community care. As the Deputy can see, the review is wide-ranging.  The views of relevant stakeholders will be considered as part of the review.  Planning and terms of reference for the review are being finalised at present.</P>
        <P>The nursing homes support scheme provides financial support to people who have been assessed as requiring long-term nursing home care.  Applicants to the scheme undergo a financial assessment to determine how much they will contribute towards the cost of their care each week, and what portion of the cost the HSE will meet.  The scheme is resource capped.  In this regard, the total gross long-term residential care budget in the current year is &euro;994.7 million.  This is effectively funding for the nursing homes support scheme, albeit that transitional arrangements &mdash; that is, subvention, contract beds and people who were in public nursing homes prior to the introduction of the scheme &mdash; must be also facilitated from within the subhead.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;55 million was originally allocated to the scheme for 2012.  However, the Minister for Health subsequently decided to transfer &euro;13 million of the &euro;55 million for a pilot scheme of increased and targeted community care interventions in 2012. The decision on the transfer of funding was taken following analysis of a report into the care needs assessment process which determines whether a person requires long-term residential care.  The report was based on an audit of 1,200 persons in long-term residential care.  It found, among other things, that while in 93% of the cases long-term residential care was recommended, in 40% of the cases the individuals were not considered for interventions such as home care packages.  In a further 40% of the cases it is not clear if they were considered for such packages.</P>
        <P>This report will now also form part of our consideration for the wider review now being planned.  The special delivery unit is working with the HSE to ensure intermediate facilities and options are available to older persons with the overall objective of ensuring that as many people as possible are empowered to remain in their homes for as long as possible in line with their wishes and Government policy.</P>
        <P>It is therefore a wide-ranging review but that is not to take from the success of the scheme itself.  If we find that significant numbers of people are in long-term nursing home when they would prefer to be at home in supported housing with home help, we need to move in that direction.  Given the way the system currently operates, it incentivises the residential aspect of care rather than the community setting, which is most people&rsquo;s first choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I know she does not have direct responsibility for the scheme but she has a broad knowledge of it.  I have no difficulty with a review that seeks savings, efficiencies and competitive tendering between public and private suppliers.  I hope that is carried out speedily and efficiently but I cannot reconcile the fact that the HSE&rsquo;s national health service plan proposes to take 1,000 beds out of long-stay residential care.  On the one hand, we are talking about a review while on the other we have already made a decision that up to 1,000 beds will be taken out of the system.  Could we not have had the review in advance of the HSE making that determination in the context of providing health care?  Population demographics mean we will require further investment in long-term residential care, which everybody accepts, but the opposite is happening.</P>
        <P>We should have an increase in the number of people who are assessed for home care packages to see if they can reside at home with supports.  The problem, however, is that home care packages have not been increased and home-help hours have been reduced.  In addition, out-of-hours GP services are being curtailed but such services are essential for elderly people who wish to reside in their communities.</P>
        <P>This review is examining the fair deal scheme in a narrow and focused manner.  The review is a whitewash to make savings without examining broader issues.  If the review examined broader issues the closure of 1,000 community nursing home beds would be shelved until the review reported its findings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make it clear that this is not about saving money.  It is an important part of the review, however, to ensure we are getting value for money by examining, for example, the relative costs of private versus public nursing home care.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>We do not have hard figures on this so we need to find out why there are differences and what they mean.  We cannot ignore a situation where 40% of people in nursing home care were not offered any alternative and would probably be better off in supported housing in their local community or in their own home with home help and other services.  On a policy level we want to ensure as far as possible people are enabled to live in their own homes for as long as possible and if this is not possible there should be a supported arrangement.  This is one of the reasons the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, will meet to examine the potential for developing supported housing through local authorities.  The fair deal scheme has been successful but there has been too much emphasis on it being the only option available to older people who need support.  It is right from a policy perspective to explore other options which are more in the interests of older people and which would meet their needs as expressed, which is to stay in one&rsquo;s own home for as long as possible and if this is not possible to at least stay in the local community.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of the investigation into the increase in narcolepsy in children and adolescents in 2009 and 2010.  I commend Dr. Darina O&rsquo;Flanagan, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and the expert group on the work they did looking into this problem.  The study found an increased risk of developing narcolepsy in those aged between 15 and 19 who received the Pandemrix swine flu vaccine compared to those who had not received it.  These results are very similar to those seen in Sweden and Finland with a clear increased risk evident from the available data.  However, it is very unlikely the vaccine alone would be sufficient to explain what has been seen and observed by the expert group.  International experts agree a number of factors are likely to have contributed to the increased risk and a number of ongoing international studies will provide additional information.  The report shows the rate of narcolepsy among children in Ireland rose 13-fold since the vaccine was administered.  The overall findings tally with those gathered in Finland on the sharp increase in narcolepsy among those who received the Pandemrix vaccine.  Like Ireland, Finland had a large scale flu vaccination campaign in 2009 and 2010.</P>
        <P>As of 16 December last year 28 cases of narcolepsy with a symptom onset since April 2009 had been identified in children and adolescents in Ireland.  Of these, 22 had received the Pandemrix vaccine before the symptoms onset.  Based on the primary study period between 1 April 2009 and 31 December 2010 and the first health care contact because of narcolepsy symptoms, the group found a significant 13-fold increase in narcolepsy in children and adolescents vaccinated with Pandemrix compared with unvaccinated children and adolescents.  The absolute number of narcolepsy cases attributable to Pandemrix vaccination was five per 100,000 vaccinated children.</P>
        <P>Narcolepsy is a nervous system disorder and its exact cause is not known.  In some patients narcolepsy is linked to a reduced amount of the protein hypocretin, which is made in the brain, but what causes the brain to produce less of this protein is unclear.  There is a possibility that narcolepsy is an auto-immune disorder, which is where the body&rsquo;s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.  Narcolepsy tends to run in families and certain genes are linked to it.  Narcolepsy symptoms usually occur between the ages of 15 and 30.  The symptoms are periods of extreme drowsiness during the day and a strong urge to sleep often followed by a sharp nap or sleep attack often lasting 15 minutes although they can be longer.  They may happen after eating, while driving, while speaking to somebody or other situations.  Most often the person awakes feeling refreshed.  Dreamlike hallucinations between sleep and wakefulness can occur which involve seeing or hearing things and possibly other symptoms.  Sleep paralysis is where a person with narcolepsy cannot move as they begin to fall asleep or wake up.  It may last for 15 minutes.  The person suffers a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake which makes him or her unable to move.  Strong emotions such as laughter or anger can trigger cataplexy whereby one&rsquo;s head will suddenly fall forward, one&rsquo;s jaw will become slack and one&rsquo;s knees will buckle.  Most attacks of cataplexy last for 30 seconds but in severe cases a person may fall and stay paralysed for several minutes.</P>
        <P>There is no known cure for narcolepsy.  The approach is to control the symptoms.  Lifestyle changes and emotional counselling can help a person to work and take part in social activities.  These involve eating lighter vegetarian meals during the day and other issues to do with sleep.  It is a lifelong condition.  It is not deadly but may be dangerous if episodes occur while driving, operating machinery or similar activities.  The complications include difficulty functioning at work and taking part in social activities, injuries or accidents and suffering side-effects of medicines used to treat the disorder.  However, it can be controlled with treatment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House its importance.</P>
        <P>In response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the HSE procured two vaccines, Pandemrix from GlazoSmithKline and Celvapan from Baxter.  The HSE, with the approval of the Departments of Health and Finance, indemnified the suppliers from and against loss and damage in respect of any claim.  This was the arrangement for all European countries.</P>
        <P>Following reports of an increased incidence of narcolepsy in young people who were vaccinated with the Pandemrix vaccine, the Department commissioned a retrospective population-based study to investigate a possible association.  Last week the Minister, Deputy Reilly, published the findings of this study.  The study concluded that the increased incidence of narcolepsy in young people may be associated with Pandemrix vaccine.  The findings are similar to those found in Finland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills to address the needs of those affected by this condition.  A memorandum for Government setting out the full response to this issue is being prepared for submission in the coming weeks.  I assure the House this matter is a priority for the Department and all possible options are being explored to meet the needs of those who developed narcolepsy following receipt of the pandemrix vaccine.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I echo the words of Dr. Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, that vaccination is very safe and it is important the current vaccination programme continues to protect children and adults against the serious consequences of preventable diseases.  This is a very rare thing and people should continue to have a high level of confidence in our vaccination programmes.</P>
        <P>I recognise the work of the campaign group, Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder, SOUND, which represents 40 children it believes have been affected to ensure their needs are taken seriously.</P>
        <P>There is concern in regard to this indemnification by the State in terms of the difficulties that have arisen and the cost to the taxpayer in respect of the services now required.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the decision making process in terms of the Minister&rsquo;s indemnification of the suppliers from damages in respect of any claims, which is now an issue.  While the number of people affected is not high, those affected will suffer severely for the remainder of their lives.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the reason for the State&rsquo;s indemnification of the suppliers and the implications of this as set out in the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision was taken by Government to indemnify the suppliers because that was the only basis on which the vaccine would be available in the country.  As I stated earlier, similar arrangements were put in place in other European countries.  There was an urgency in regard to making the vaccine available and the only basis on which it could be made available was if the State indemnified it.  That is the basis on which the decision was taken.</P>
        <P>As stated by Deputy Neville, the parents of those affected have formed a group called SOUND, which is actively engaged with the HSE and has two representatives on the HSE serious incident alert group, which is managing this issue.  The group is involved in identifying the needs of the children affected and how those needs can best be met from a health and educational point of view.  That work is well under way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, I am disappointed the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is not in the Chamber to take this matter.  He was present in the House for the Order of Business and cannot be too far away.</P>
        <P>Clonmel Garda station is the largest station in the Tipperary division and deals with a large population.  It is possibly one of the largest stations in the south east of the country.  There is no point in beating around the bush; it is not fit for purpose.  I, and previous Members of the House, tabled motions on this matter on many occasions but to no avail.  The reason given was always that no suitable site was available; a committee was examining a number of different sites including the old Chadwicks building, which has since been sold, and the old Barlo building, which is now redundant and, the OPW is currently examining locations and preparing files.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no reason the Government and Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, having closed the prestigious Kickham barracks in Clonmel, the staff of which were treated less than courteously, cannot immediately make at least half of that site of 11 acres available for a decent functioning, fit for purpose, Garda station for Clonmel and the surrounding districts.  This is what is needed if we are to have a proper community policing regime, community alert and neighbourhood watch groups, the capacity to carry out difficult and precarious detective work, a drugs unit and to house state-of-the-art IT facilities.  The current station is nothing short of a hovel, the public interface of which is disgraceful in terms of it not being much bigger than this area where I am sitting.  It provides no dignity for people visiting the station or for garda&iacute; who are doing their best to deal with people.  A woman or man with a buggy fills the tiny space available, leaving other people to wait their turn in the corridor or out on the street.  It is not acceptable that the garda&iacute;, under Superintendent Courtney, who do a wonderful job must work in these conditions.  We need a station that is fit for purpose, a place wherein garda&iacute; can be comfortable and at ease in fulfilling their roles of dealing with the public and codes of practice, which are quite onerous.  We also need a place fit for purpose for restorative justice projects.  It is not a situation of the garda&iacute; and us; the people must buy into the community policing.  We need decent facilities in which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the reserve can carry out their work.  We also need space for the storage of Garda vehicles and equipment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clonmel Garda station is the poor relation, in terms of facilities, in the town, which has state-of-the-art courthouses, civil defence and ambulance services.  The county council also has new machinery and composting facilities.  Many of the community facilities are in better condition than the Garda station, which is Dickensian.  Also, it belongs to South Tipperary County Council which needs it back because it is renting buildings around the town of Clonmel and further afield to house IT and other facilities which cannot be located at its offices.  The reserve force still does not have a training area and will, tonight, be without a home for a fifth week despite promises by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, that they would be housed before the barracks was closed.</P>
        <P>There are 11.5 acres available on the barracks site, which could be used for dual or treble purposes.  Clonmel needs a fit for purpose Garda Station which allows the provision of a justice service in south Tipperary and above all provides accommodation for Garda and the equipment they require to tackle the many issues which they must tackle with dignity and bravery.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must have the tools of the trade to allow it to do its job.  The current facility would not be accepted anywhere else.  There are 11 acres available on the Kickham barracks site, which is a prestigious site adjacent to the town centre.  The Garda Station could co-exist at that location with the reserve Defence Forces and many other community regimes, thus providing free of charge security for this magnificent listed building that will be laid to waste if not utilised soon.  I do not have much faith in the Minister, Deputy Shatter, doing anything with it given the manner in which he treated the soldiers of that barracks and the people of south Tipperary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, who has asked me to convey to the Deputy that owing to a prior engagement he is unable to be here and to thank him for raising this topic.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of new Garda stations and Garda accommodation generally, including all site purchases and new buildings and the examination of potential sites for the location of Garda stations, comes under the remit of the Office of Public Works.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na establishes its own accommodation priorities around the country, these priorities are progressed in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for capital expenditure on Garda accommodation.  The relevant expenditure is met from the Office of Public Works Vote.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, has been advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works previously examined a number of options for Clonmel Garda station, including the provision of a new district headquarters.  This was the subject of an examination by the Office of Public Works with a view to securing a new site but none of the locations examined was deemed suitable for Garda requirements.  However, more recently, a potential site for the location of a new Garda district headquarters has emerged within the former Kickham Army barracks.  As the Deputy will be aware, this barracks is no longer operational and is not being retained for military requirements.  In that context, the Garda authorities, in conjunction with their colleagues in the Office of Public Works, are examining potential proposals on the development of a new district headquarters.  On completion of this process, the relevant parties will work together to explore and develop possible options to further progress this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that the provision of new accommodation in Clonmel is a project to which they attach a high priority.  However, the Deputy will be aware that, arising from the current economic difficulties, the capital budget for the Office of Public Works has been reduced for 2012 and subsequent years.  The Garda authorities have confirmed that this matter will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We can cut to the chase here.  I was involved in trying to identify sites with the previous Administration and the OPW.  I was disappointed when the Taoiseach decided to combine the defence and justice portfolios.  I felt that the Department of Defence was entitled to its own Minister.  Surely there must be some logic to it.  We were promised Government reform.  Clonmel should receive some benefit from the loss of its battalion and the closure of Kickham Barracks.  The fact that the same Minister is in charge should also be of assistance.  The Minister of State should cut out all the speak and all the spiel.  We need to be given the reform that was promised.  This land and property is in the hands of the Department of Defence.  There is no need for the spiel about the OPW looking for sites and speaking to senior officials in the Garda.  I accept that has to be done.  We need security at the ready-made site I have mentioned.  It could be transferred to the Department of Justice and Equality without any cost.  The same Minister is responsible for the two Departments.  There is no need for a vote of the Government.</P>
        <P>If we have to wait for the OPW to come up with a site, we will be waiting for a long time.  I believe that some of the other sites that have been looked at by the OPW are eminently suitable.  The OPW deemed that they were not suitable because the money required was not available.  I accept that a new Garda district headquarters is needed.  We are ready to house it.  The garda&iacute; are ready, willing and able to occupy it.  The building to which I refer is in pristine condition.  I have been in and out of it on Daffodil Day for the past 25 years.  I have attended many other public functions there.  It is a public building.  The people are proud of it.  The national flag flew on it until it was taken down recently.  We need the flag to fly on it again.  If the local garda&iacute; were housed there, they could be proud of their premises.  Community groups, school groups and businesses could visit the new Garda headquarters to learn about community policing.  Young people could be encouraged to be involved in community alert and neighbourhood watch programmes.  A wonderful model could be developed at the site.  As the old adage says, &ldquo;where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come to Clonmel to look at the site in question.  He should instruct the OPW to dedicate five and a half acres of the 11-acre site for the purposes of the new Garda headquarters immediately.  We have been told it would cost &euro;3 million to upgrade the present facility, but I suggest that cannot be done.  One cannot make a silk purse of a sow&rsquo;s ear.  God forgive the terminology.  It cannot be done.  The ready-made building that is available on this site could, with slight adaptation, be used for these purposes.  Above all, it offers plenty of space for a modern functioning Garda station in 2012.</P>

	<P>As a result, there have been significant reductions in capital budgets.  As I said earlier, the OPW and the Garda authorities are examining the proposals in respect of the Kickham Barracks site.  There is no doubt that there is potential at the site.  That possibility is under consideration at the moment, within the constraints of the capital budget.  I will be happy to convey the Deputy&rsquo;s views to the Minister concerned.</P>

	<P>Perhaps there will be some time remaining after Deputy Conway, Deputy Buttimer and I have spoken.  Section 3 of this Bill provides for an increase from 260 to 520 in the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions that are required if one is to become eligible to become a voluntary contributor.  This will bring the number in question into line with the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions that are required to qualify for a contributory State pension.  Legislation that was enacted in 1997 provided for an increase to 520 in the minimum number of paid contributions required for the contributory State pension, in the case of applicants who reach pension age on or after 6 April 2012.  The minimum number of paid contributions to qualify for the contributory State pension has always been mirrored in the voluntary contribution scheme.  The scheme is aimed at ensuring that individuals who have already established future entitlement to contributory State pension upon reaching retirement age can maintain their social insurance record by making voluntary contributions in the intervening period.  This is more evidence of the reform which is badly needed to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s social protection budget is streamlined.  I applaud the Minister for this.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the measures in this legislation that are aimed at tackling fraud prevention.  Some commentators have estimated that social welfare fraud costs the Exchequer over &euro;700 million each year.  It is hard to estimate its real cost.  We know it is happening.  It is right and prudent that new measures like the introduction of the public services card with key security features, including a photograph and signature, will be used to authenticate the identity of individuals.  One of the advantages of the public services card is that it will help to reduce fraud and errors resulting from the incorrect identification of claimants.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal will provide for the introduction of a new condition for any new claim for social welfare payment, to the effect that the claimant must satisfy the Department as to his or her identity, including allowing for electronic capture of photograph and signature.  I believe this significant measure will strengthen our checks and balances.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  Since the publication of this Bill, I have been engaging closely with a number of groups that advocate on behalf of lone parents and families who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  I have first-hand experience of that.  During the time I have been so kindly allotted, I would like to focus on the changes to payments that will be made as a result of this legislation.  The changes in question are an unfortunate legacy of the squandering of money by the previous Administration.  Previous Governments were often very good at manipulating the social welfare system in the run-up to budget time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaraConway"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciara Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The reform of the social welfare system that is being provided for is long overdue and is necessary in the interests of those who find themselves in unfortunate economic circumstances, for example having lost their jobs.  It is right that we are engaging with them in a meaningful way, rather than tossing them on a heap and putting them on a course or giving them some sort of null opportunity that does not allow them to go on and engage in the workforce.  I have seen that happening at first hand over many years.  I commend the Minister on her endeavours in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we all know, the reality is that the Department of Social Protection is one of the highest spending Government Departments.  Some of the changes that are proposed in this Bill could be mitigated if we were to adopt certain measures, particularly with regard to lone parents.  These workable low-cost measures have been suggested to me by the One Family group, with which I have been engaging on a continuous basis in recent weeks and months.  Such measures, which could help lone parents to return to the workplace, require support across Government Departments.  It is worth making the point that the Department of Social Protection is not the only Department that should get involved when people such as lone parents become unemployed and are unable to access work.  I suggest that the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should be involved in a joint approach to helping to solve such problems.  Cross-departmental and interdepartmental efforts are needed to support such women or men as they try to return to work.  A degree of flexibility should be provided for when lone parents transition to jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  If it could be negotiated between the Departments that they would not have to work full-time, but could instead be allowed to work for 15 hours a week during school hours, I believe it would be very workable.</P>
        <P>As highlighted last week, we need to examine issues associated with child care, specifically child care before and after school, and we need to engage with the Department of Education and Skills, if necessary.  The many buildings available throughout the country often lie dormant after 2.30 p.m.  We need to examine the infrastructure in communities and determine whether we can work cross-departmentally and with community groups to allow schools to be used to supply after-school care for children.</P>
        <P>We need to encourage staff in Solas and the social welfare offices to consider carefully the needs of lone parents who want to re-enter the workplace.  They must ensure that when the Pathways to Work programme is implemented fully across the country, the specific needs of lone parents will be taken into account.  The staff should interact on a one-to-one level with lone parents so there will be a good outcome, but not only for the parents.  If a parent is working or completes his or her education, his or her child is 80% or 90% more likely to complete his or her education and engage in employment.  I hope the staff in the social welfare offices and Solas will take this into consideration in this time of transformation and reform.</P>
        <P>We should monitor the circumstances of lone parents engaging with services and getting involved in education.  We should determine where we can make useful low-cost changes.  Lone parents who have engaged particular services may not have had the outcome they desired for themselves and their children.  We need to pay particular attention to this to determine whether we can change and be flexible in order to meet the needs of people who present in our offices, rather than have a one-size-fits-all approach.  We live in very different times from those of 15 or 20 years ago and, therefore, we need to have flexibility built into the system.  We are often criticised for the stringent and inflexible approach applied to those who find themselves in difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>We can work together to change attitudes among employers with regard to their openness to and acceptance of lone parents in the workplace.  I refer once more to social attitudes and flexibility.  It need not cost vast sums of money to address the problem, and an improvement and openness in work culture could certainly benefit parents who are struggling by themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is very important.  I commend Deputy Conway.  The Government is focusing on the protection of all citizens and defending their rights, and it undoubtedly faces considerable challenges.  The  Members opposite were asleep for 13 years.  In the last year of their regime, they had no choice and had to make changes.  One step they took was to examine social welfare.  Former Minister Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v became Minister for Social Protection.  &ldquo;Protection&rdquo; is the key word.  I refer to the protection of all citizens, on which the current Government continues to focus.</P>
        <P>One of the most important things we can do as politicians and legislators is ensure we tackle the issues of poverty and social exclusion.  Throwing money at the problem does not work.  The Bertie Ahern model failed.  Pouring out money before general elections does not work, as Deputy Conway stated.  The fabric of society must be considered in the context of the 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s rule.  While Fianna F&aacute;il can point to sports capital programmes and big edifices across the country, it failed to establish what we are as a people.  We should not use its model as the benchmark.</P>
        <P>Whether Deputy John Browne likes it or not, we must encourage people to remain within the education system.  When I taught at applied leaving certificate level &mdash; I was very proud and privileged to do so &mdash; I  derived great professional pride from seeing young people stay in school and then set out on a career.  Recently I met a past pupil who is now a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the alternative to the leaving certificate were not in place, this person would not have got that job.  I would hate to think of what could have happened to him.  We must encourage people to stay in school and then move to work or further education.</P>
        <P>As somebody who was involved in education, I very much commend many of our citizens on returning to education, formal or informal, and getting a second chance.  I refer to up-skilling and learning anew.  The Government is about offering opportunities; it is not a question of merely throwing money at people.  We have not got the money in any case.  The boom is gone and the bubble has burst.</P>
        <P>Contrary to the rhetoric of some in this House, but not the Members in the Chamber at present, the Government is not making any class distinction between lone parents, their families and children because they comprise a very important part of society.  Every public representative meets people from different strata of society every day and makes no distinction between them.  It ill-behoves people on the other side of the House to do so in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Deputy Conway made reference to the legacy of the previous regime and she is absolutely correct.  We must now reform our social welfare system.  The members opposite would agree it is absolutely necessary.  As policy-makers, we have a duty to consider how we might assist with the social protection of citizens, empower them and offer support.  It requires all of us to be honest.  If we really want to empower people and give them an opportunity, let us engage meaningfully.  Let us move away from headlines and sound bites and debate properly and with integrity.</P>
        <P>The Government must encourage people and facilitate participation in employment.  We must also recognise that there are difficulties in gaining employment.  This is why it is important for us to assist people in not becoming welfare dependent.  They must derive value from having a job and we must ensure this is the case.</P>
        <P>I will happily allow Deputy Browne or Deputy Calleary a minute of my remaining time in the spirit of bipartisanship in the House.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Buttimer.</P>
        <P>The primary difficulty with this legislation is one shared by the Minister for Social Protection.  She came into this House last Wednesday evening and said she agrees entirely that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place.  She promised on that evening that she would talk to her colleagues in Cabinet.  The budget was on 5 December and it is now nearly 5 May.  Has the Minister not spoken to her colleagues since December?  The groups that are campaigning, including those behind the &ldquo;7 is TOO YOUNG&rdquo; campaign, which are doing such wonderful work, have issued a statement this evening implying exactly the same, namely, that the Minister cannot offer what she called the Scandinavian model or pull the support, which she proposes to do by Thursday when this Bill is to be rammed through committee.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for having the courage to stand up to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>She is ramming this Bill through, taking the supports away and implementing legislation she herself disagrees with.  That is why it is so wrong.  The Minister is not convinced about her own policy.  She comes to the House and lands her colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, in it in order to get something out of them.  That is not the way a Minister should act.  Deputy Conway is correct; there are so many ways we can proceed, not just by using schools.  There are so many empty departmental properties nationally that we need to use better.  We have invested so much in child care, including in the early childhood scheme.  We all know of amazing community child care facilities, some of which are open after 3 p.m.  Much of the physical and capital model is in place for what the Minister wants to do.  Let us put the extra bits of the jigsaw in place.  It should not cost much money.  Deputy Conway is right.  Since I came into this House, I have seen the silo effect with Departments not giving a damn what other Departments are doing and it is part of the reason we are where we are.  That has to stop.</P>
        <P>Let us postpone the change.  The Minister agrees with us that the change is wrong so she should postpone it and spend the next year getting all the extra bits of the jigsaw in place in terms of child care.  Much of it is done but what we need are heads to be knocked together in Departments to get the extra bits in place.</P>
        <P>We must have some respect for the organisations  dealing with the situation on a daily basis and for every Member of this House who is also dealing with the situation on a daily basis and knows the impact it will have on people.  If we set a deadline to put the final bits of the jigsaw in place, in terms of child care, then we can actually achieve something out of this.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le gach Teachta a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;ospoireacht seo.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il go h-&aacute;irithe leis na Teachta&iacute; a thug a dtaca&iacute;ocht do na reachtanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la sa Bhille.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and I would especially like to thank those who gave their support to many of the measures contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I listened very carefully to what was said by those who spoke on the provisions contained in the Bill and on other social protection issues.  I appreciate the depth of feeling and sincerity of those who have criticised the measures now being proposed.  However, I would like to make it clear that these measures result from budget 2012 and the need to reduce overall social welfare expenditure and to reform the social welfare system, both of which were given as specific commitments to the IMF when the country entered the EU-IMF programme in late 2010.  The amendments are also driven by the need to make the social welfare system better by encouraging people to move closer to the world of work and away from long-term social welfare dependency.</P>
        <P>I will now respond to some of the points raised in the debate on the Bill and related Committee Stage amendments, to which I also referred during my opening contribution.  Opposition Deputies have argued that the measures contained in this Bill are targeted at specific groups, such as women, self-employed people, home-makers and rural groups.  This is not in any way true.  Equality and fairness are important tenets of our social welfare system and ones which I uphold vigorously.</P>
        <P>The higher rates of consistent poverty experienced by lone parents and their children, in comparison to the population generally, are acknowledged.  The fact that they have remained at these levels, despite more than &euro;1 billion being spent on the one parent family payment annually, indicates that the long-term income support, which the one parent family scheme provided up to last year until children were aged 18, or 22 if in full-time education, to lone parents without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training was not effective in addressing the poverty and social exclusion experienced by some of these families.</P>
        <P>Social welfare is a hand up not a hand out.  A key objective of this Government is the activation of people of working age in receipt of income support, including lone parents.  This is reflected in the development of the national employments and entitlements service with a move from passive income support to active engagement with social welfare customers of working age.  That is from roughly the time people leave school, or complete their education, to the time they come to retire.  This involves the identification of customer needs and the provision of co-ordinated supports to support them into education, training and employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said at the start of the Second Stage debate, the availability and affordability of child care is central to enabling parents move from social welfare dependence to work and financial independence.  While there are services in place in regard to pre-primary school care, more services are required for afters school care.  Child care supports available to lone parents include: the early childhood care and education programme, which is open to all children aged between three years three months and four years six months in September of each year and to all parents.  It provides a free year of part-time care and education; the community child care subvention programme, which funds some 1,000 community-based non-profit child care facilities nationwide to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income families; and the child care education and training scheme, which is implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on behalf of F&Aacute;S and the VECs.  Under the scheme, parents who are F&Aacute;S-VEC trainees and who need assistance with child care costs to access education and training courses in order to enter or return to employment, do not have to pay for child care.</P>
        <P>Reform of the one parent family payment and activation policy in regard to people parenting on their own and of working age poses challenges.  These challenges will require a whole of Government response with regard to the provision of appropriate education, training and employment supports and the child care and especially the provision of after school care that all job-seeking parents will require.  In advance of leaving the one parent family payment, lone parents may apply for the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance and, if they are in employment of more than 19 hours per week, they may claim family income supplement.  The rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s and qualified child increases are exactly the same for one parent families and general jobseekers.</P>
        <P>I have listened to, and been part of, the debate on child care and preschool and after school education for more than 25 years.  We really have to change the system.  To quote Rahm Emanuel, sometimes a crisis is the best time to make changes which the previous Government agreed with as it brought in the early childhood education provision which I supported in opposition because I thought it was a good move.</P>
        <P>I refer to voluntary contributors, to which a number of Deputies referred.  There are some misconceptions about this scheme.  The total number of participants in the scheme is currently 3,200.  Some people who commented seemed to feel that this applied to tens of thousands of people.  It is actually a very small specialist number of people.  The number of new applications in 2011 was 1,720.  It does not primarily affect women &mdash; 62% are male and 38% are female.  I think Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said it affected women but that is not true.    It affects former self-employed and employed people, with 25% being former employed contributors and 75% being former self-employed contributors.  It is estimated that 100 cases would be affected by the change in 2013, with a further 100 cases annually from 2014 onwards, but it will not affect existing cases.  The principal purpose of the change in the scheme is to support the change in the minimum number of paid contributions for the State contributory pension to 520.  Failure to increase the voluntary contributor scheme minimum number to 520 would undermine the savings arising from the change in the pension.</P>
        <P>In respect of fraud and control measures, Deputy Sean Fleming asked how savings were calculated and why the savings figures were high year after year.  Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the Department&rsquo;s schemes.  They represent an estimate of the value of prevented future social welfare expenditure on fraudulent claims that would have been incurred if the control work had not been carried out.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and do not include any case of departmental or clerical error or any case where the customer voluntarily told the Department of a change in his or her means or circumstances resulting in an adjustment to the customer&rsquo;s rate of payment.</P>
        <P>My Department has a process of continuous review of claims.  By the end of 2011, &euro;645 million in control savings were recorded and in excess of 982,000 cases were reviewed.  The control savings target for 2012 is &euro;645 million, with a target of reviewing 945,000 individual welfare claims.</P>
        <P>Ports and airports are the subject of an amendment and have arisen for discussion on Second Stage.  While social welfare inspectors have a range of existing powers of inquiry, this does not include any specific power of inquiry at our ports and airports.  The amendment will allow my Department&rsquo;s inspectors to make inquiries at ports and airports where they believe or are aware a social welfare offence has or is being committed by an individual, that is, where they have reasonable suspicion or evidence that an individual is entering the jurisdiction solely for the purposes of continuing to claim social welfare payments to which he or she is not entitled.  This is an important additional power.  As Deputies are probably aware, there has been considerable commentary on this issue from time to time.</P>
        <P>Regarding rent supplement and landlords, there are almost 95,000 rent supplement recipients, requiring a provisional expenditure outturn of &euro;503 million in 2011.  The Estimate for 2012 is &euro;437 million.  We are paying for approximately 40% of the private sector rented accommodation.  Although there are existing powers that allow for the general investigation of rent supplement claims, these do not include any specific power of inquiry to investigate a landlord of a premises where a rent supplement is being paid to ensure that the supplement is being correctly paid in respect of the person living in that accommodation.</P>
        <P>The measure relating to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit was announced at the time of the budget and will not affect any person whose sole income is from social welfare, for example, the headline rate of &euro;188 per week for a single person.  People who are currently in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are working three days per week receive &euro;94, or 50% of their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, in addition to their income from employment.  The income from employment will vary according to rates of pay and amount of time worked each day.  However, as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is not means tested, no regard is given to this when paying the &euro;94.  There have been some suggestions that this weekly mix of income from employment and some jobseeker&rsquo;s payment has resulted in some employers experiencing difficulties in getting staff to return to or avail of full-time work.  The effect of this measure will be to reduce the contribution from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the weekly amount of total income &mdash; welfare plus wages combined &mdash; and help towards a reduction in the reliance on the welfare system among those who avail of a mix of welfare and earned income.</P>
        <P>We are moving jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a six-day week to a five-day week.  An estimated 18,000 jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients will be affected in a full year.  It is important to note that they may opt for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is subject to a means test.  If a person normally works full-time but his or her employer reduces the number of days worked on a permanent basis, the person may receive jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the days he or she does not work.  For each day that a person is unemployed, one sixth of the normal rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is currently payable.  For example, if a person takes up part-time work for two days, he or she can get four sixths of the normal jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment for the week.  The measure in the Bill proposes that, from July 2012, the benefit will move to a five-day system as opposed to a six-day working week basis.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012: Motion to Instruct Committee</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 that it has power to make provisions to amend and extend the law relating to the Social Insurance Fund, employed contributors and employment contributions, supplementary welfare allowance, offences, miscellaneous control provisions and proceedings, claims and payments, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, appointments and duties of social welfare inspectors, social welfare, miscellaneous provisions on budgeting, and occupational pension schemes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to outline to Deputies the range of important provisions to be included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 by way of Committee Stage amendments.</P>
        <P>First, I wish to explain why it is necessary to introduce so many proposals by way of Committee Stage amendment, rather than having them included in the Bill as published.  As Deputies will know, the Bill gives effect to a number of social welfare measures announced by the Ministers for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform in budget 2012.  Unlike the powers available to the Minister for Finance, as Minister for Social Protection I have no powers to bring forward budget day resolutions enabling social welfare measures to take effect immediately or from an early date.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance can bring forward such budget day resolutions to allow for the implementation of certain taxation matters with immediate effect or from the beginning of income tax year on 1 January and for the subsequent enactment of the relevant legislative amendments within a four-month period.  However, the necessary amendments to the Social Welfare Acts must first be enacted by the Oireachtas before the relevant budget changes to the social welfare code can come into force.</P>
        <P>Given the very tight timeframe between the finalisation of the measures to be included in the annual budget package, usually early in December, and the implementation date of many of these measures in early January, and given also that the Oireachtas usually rises for the Christmas recess the week before Christmas, there is an extremely short period of time available in which to draft the required amendments to the Social Welfare Acts and to have these amendments enacted by the Oireachtas before they are due to commence.  This reduces the scope of what can be included in the Social Welfare Bill that is presented to the Oireachtas in early December.</P>
        <P>Budget 2012 delivered on our promise not to cut primary social welfare payments.  To deliver on this promise and at the same time make a contribution towards the tax and spending adjustments required in 2012 to meet the &euro;16 billion shortfall in the Government&rsquo;s finances, it has been necessary to provide for a range of reforms and other adjustments in order to restore sustainability to the social protection system.  Many of these reforms were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2011.  However, given the extremely tight timescale for the passage of that Act, it was not possible to include all of these reforms in that Act.  As a result it has been necessary to introduce the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 to provide for the enactment of the remaining reforms by early May 2012, so as to comply with the implementation deadlines provided for in the budget.</P>
        <P>Owing to the complexity of some of the measures, it was not possible to have all of the legal and legislative issues resolved in time for their inclusion in the Bill as published.  In addition, following recent discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance arising from recommendations received from the Comptroller and Auditor General, it has become apparent that changes to the legislation governing the operation of the Social Insurance Fund are necessary.  Accordingly, it has been necessary to include these items in the Bill by way of Committee Stage amendment.</P>
        <P>I fully recognise the difficulties this poses for Deputies in scrutinising these measures.  It is for these reasons that I ensured that these amendments were circulated to all Deputies as soon as they had been finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I have also arranged for detailed briefing on each of these items to be sent to the various Whips for distribution to Deputies, as necessary.  In addition, I arranged for a briefing session for the Opposition spokespersons, at which the various departmental experts were available to provide detailed explanations and clarifications on each of these measures.</P>
        <P>It is very important to balance the reforms of the social welfare system being provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 with other measures to provide for the control of social welfare expenditure by strengthening the powers of social welfare inspectors to tackle fraud and abuse of the system.  While social welfare fraud is often perceived by some as being a victimless crime, this is clearly not the case.  As well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and to taxpayers, those abusing the social welfare system also undermine public confidence in the entire system.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the main provisions contained in the various Committee Stage amendments that are covered by this motion.  The Social Insurance Fund is financed on a tripartite basis, from contributions paid by employers, contributions paid by employees and the self-employed, with any shortfall being made up by way of an Exchequer subvention.  This Exchequer subvention is provided for through my Department&rsquo;s Vote, Vote 38, as sanctioned by the Oireachtas.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Finance want a clear delineation between borrowings for cash-flow purposes for the Social Insurance Fund and extra funds required to meet additional expenditure requirements to deal with an overall annual shortfall in PRSI receipts or an increase in expenditure on benefits paid out of the fund.  Accordingly, the amendment being provided for is for the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer, via the central fund, to address the cash-flow requirements of the Social Insurance Fund.  This will complement the periodic drawdown of funds from Exchequer subvention, as provided for through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>Three separate amendments affect PRSI liability on share-related remuneration, one of which follows on from a change in taxation provided for in budget 2012.  The other two items relate to changes in the operation of PRSI liability on share-related remuneration arising from clarifications and new administrative arrangements provided by Revenue.  The recent Finance Act provided for the introduction of a new special assignee relief programme, SARP, to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in the companies who are based abroad to take up positions in Ireland.  The change that I am providing for is to clarify that the income tax relief, as provided for in the Finance Act 2012, does not extend to liability for PRSI contributions.  In other words such people will continue to be liable for PRSI contributions on all of their income.</P>
        <P>PRSI liability was extended to share-related remuneration in budget 2011.  While most PRSI contributions are collected together with income tax through the PAYE system, it is not possible to collect PRSI contributions on certain gains from share options through this system.  In the circumstances, provision was made for the collection of PRSI contributions on such share gains through my Department&rsquo;s special collection system.  Revenue is now in a position to collect PRSI contributions on such gains through its relevant tax on share options, RTSO, system and I am providing for the necessary amendments to facilitate this collection mechanism.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am clarifying the relevant legislative provisions relating to employer PRSI liability on share-related remuneration.  As part of the jobs initiative launched last May, the Minister for Finance announced that employers would not be liable for PRSI on such remuneration.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that all share-related remuneration, including remuneration that is taxable under the PAYE system as well as remuneration that is taxable under the self-assessment system, will be exempt for the employer element of the PRSI contribution.  The provisions relating to refunds of PRSI contributions are also being amended to provide for the refund of any employer PRSI contributions that may have been paid by employers in respect of share-related remuneration.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement, which is payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a premises that is their sole place of residence.  This supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  The capital element of the repayment is not taken into account in calculating the amount of the supplement.  Budget 2012 provided for the curtailment of access to this supplement for the first 12 months while the person is involved in the mortgage arrears resolution process, as set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which applies to mortgage lenders.  The underlying principle is to ensure the mortgage arrears resolution process functions alongside State supports such as the mortgage interest supplement, and that the forbearance arrangements implicit in the mortgage arrears resolution process are reflected in the eligibility criteria for the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Given the significant cost of the rent supplement scheme, at over half a billion euro last year and an estimated &euro;430 million this year, specific powers must be available to ensure that expenditure on the scheme is adequately controlled.  While existing powers allow for the general investigation of rent supplement claims, this does not include any specific power of inquiry with regard to the landlord of a premises where a rent supplement is being paid to ensure the supplement is being correctly paid &mdash; for example, that it is being paid to the correct person.  I am providing for a new power of inquiry with regard to landlords by social welfare inspectors to ensure rent supplement is being correctly paid.  In addition, I am further strengthening the powers of social welfare inspectors to enable them to make inquiries at ports and airports.  It is a condition of entitlement for certain payments, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, that the claimant must be living in Ireland.  My Department&rsquo;s special investigation unit has found an increasing incidence of non-residency in the State by a small minority of social welfare claimants.  Some people are entering the jurisdiction solely for the purpose of continuing to claim social welfare payments to which they are not entitled.  In the last two years, it was found that 1,400 people were continuing to claim social welfare payments despite not being resident.  This detection has resulted in Exchequer savings of &euro;13 million.  The new powers that I am proposing for social welfare inspectors will be of particular use in tackling this type of social welfare fraud.  Many Deputies and Members of the other House have referred to this on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>I am also providing for new powers with regard to the provision of information to establish a person&rsquo;s identity for social welfare purposes.  The Department has commenced the phased introduction of the new public services card, which will act as a key for access to public services in general and for identifying and authenticating the identities of individuals.  In the case of social welfare claims, the existing legislation is being amended to make it a condition that a claimant&rsquo;s identity is appropriately authenticated.  This provision also allows for a photograph and electronic signature to be taken, retained and reproduced where required.</P>
        <P>In line with the announcement in budget 2012, the basis for calculating entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is being changed from a six-day week to a five-day week.  This will mean that a person who works for three days in the week will in future get two fifths of the weekly rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit instead of three sixths of, or half, the weekly rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit as at present.  In other words, the social welfare week will move from six days to five days.</P>
        <P>The household budgeting facility currently operated by my Department enables social welfare recipients to budget for various utility bills by allowing for a fixed amount of their weekly payment to be deducted and paid over to various utilities such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  This facility also extends to telephone companies.  While the facility was originally available only to Eircom customers, following the deregulation of the telecommunications market, this facility has been extended to the other telecommunications operators.  The household budgeting facility is also being extended to cover other regulated energy providers such as Airtricity and Flogas.  I hope that will be of assistance to a number of people in organising their household finances.</P>
        <P>In my Second Stage speech I advised Deputies that I intended to introduce a Committee Stage amendment to make it a requirement that local authority tenants who have consented to their differential rents being deducted under the household budget facility and paid over to the local authority could not withdraw that consent without getting the permission of the local authority.  Following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it has not been possible to proceed with this amendment in the form agreed with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, as I am anxious that this proposal be implemented as soon as possible, I have asked my officials to explore with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government alternative approaches to achieving this objective, with a view to the inclusion of a workable amendment in the next available social welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am proposing to introduce a number of Committee Stage amendments relating to occupational pension provision.  These amendments include a new provision with regard to how the accrued pension rights of deferred members, that is, former employees, of defined benefit pension schemes are revalued.  The other changes I am proposing will clarify a number of the provisions in the Bill as published.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject this motion emphatically.  Everything about it is wrong.  It should not be here.  Such a mess has been made of this legislation that the only decent thing for the Minister to do is to withdraw it, take a few weeks out and, when she has had proper time to consider what she is doing, reintroduce the legislation so we can discuss it here in a proper manner.  The only good thing that happened here today was the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s statement that he had asked, under Standing Order 141, that a revised explanatory memorandum be produced.  That arose as the result of a request I made when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government during the last Oireachtas.  I wrote to the then Ceann Comhairle requesting that where substantial and significant amendments are proposed, to help Members discuss them on Committee Stage, a new and revised explanatory memorandum should always be produced.  I am pleased that the Ceann Comhairle invoked that this morning.</P>
        <P>We will not have time to discuss all the details of the amendments on Committee Stage, because not only did the Government guillotine Second Stage, it has also guillotined this motion tonight and it will guillotine Committee, Report and Final Stages.  The Minister has been in office for 14 months.  I am personally shocked that within such a short period of time she has become so unfair and unreasonable towards Members of the Oireachtas.  If this had happened more than 14 months ago and she had been sitting on this side, she would rightly have been giving out about how the D&aacute;il was being treated with disrespect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It did happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am amazed that within 14 months the Minister has followed down this road.</P>
        <P>It is five months since budget day.  Nobody believes there was not enough time to draft this legislation.  Maybe the person who wrote the script believes it, but nobody else does.  When the budget was announced we knew the Finance Bill would be introduced, but we also knew the social welfare Bill would follow.  There is no reason the preparation work could not have been carried out over the last five months.</P>
        <P>The Minister published this legislation on 3 April, just over two weeks ago.  In it, she provided that one-parent family payments were to cease when the children concerned reached seven years of age, to commence in a couple of years&rsquo; time.  Within a fortnight of publishing the Bill, however, she announced in her Second Stage speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">I entirely agree that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries [...].  That is why I am undertaking tonight that I will only proceed with the measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care by the time of this year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is some eight or ten months away.  The Minister published her legislation, intending to do something on 3 April.  Within a fortnight she came to the House and stated she did not agree with what she had published earlier this month and would reverse it.  The following week the Minister returns with the same amendment.  I have heard of U-turns and double U-turns and pirouettes, or whatever the word may be, but I cannot believe the Minister has done this.  Last week, some people actually thought the Minister was making a great announcement.  I spoke to some journalists who praised the Minister but I said: &ldquo;Hold on.  The Minister is not doing that.  She is saying she would like to do it if the Minister makes a change in the budget next year to give her a bankable commitment.&rdquo;  In the meantime, as I noted last week when the Minister announced this, she is using young children and their parents as a pawn in her budget negotiation for next year.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Essentially, we are back to square one.  I find it extraordinary that a few short weeks after publishing the Bill the Minister is back in the House with a whole range of new amendments, many of which will be out of order under the terms of this House because what is being planned within them is not in keeping with the Bill as published on Second Stage only two weeks ago.  I could understand this if the economic or the budgetary situation had changed or if something had happened over a period of months, making it necessary to revisit legislation before it went to Committee Stage.  The legislation was published only a few weeks ago, however, and already we have to deal with motions to allow us to discuss these amendments on Committee Stage.  To use the Minister&rsquo;s own phrase, she has made a right banjax of the legislation.  She used that phrase about the country last year.</P>
        <P>On this issue, I will quote another phrase the Minister has used several times, namely, rushed legislation is guaranteed to be bad legislation.  There will be flaws in this Bill.  The Minister is stating that even though we had five months to know what we wanted to do, we were all rushed during nights in the past week or so, trying to publish amendments.  There are amendments going through the Bills Office and the staff do not know whether they are coming or going.  In addition to the list of amendments the Minister sent in, I understand the amendments for Committee Stage cannot be published until this motion is passed.  We have seen some drafts that were e-mailed to us but I have not yet seen the full list of amendments for Committee Stage which is starting tomorrow morning.  As the Minister stated, some of the amendments she is making are more substantial than original sections of the Bill.  How are we, as an Opposition, meant to have an opportunity to amend the Minister&rsquo;s amendments?  There is no time allotted yet in the Order of Business for Report and Final Stages, only a mention of Second and Remaining Stages to be concluded by 3.42 p.m. on Thursday.  We do not yet know if there will be a separate Report Stage.  I would hope there will be.  Several hours should be set aside for it.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to allow us an opportunity, even right up to the last minute, to make amendments following Committee Stage.  This might involve a sos in the D&aacute;il for a couple of hours or some other such arrangement in order that we can make some amendments on Thursday.  Again, this is on the basis of the Minister forcing a guillotine on the debate.  I still do not know why it must be finished on Thursday.  If it is so important, the Minister might have taken it into committee for some days instead of taking up the entire proceedings of the House.  We could have given it extra time in committee, as happens with the Finance Bill which has a full three day period on Committee Stage, returning then for Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il.  To rush all this in the Chamber in one fell swoop is totally unfair not only to us, but to the people who are trying to follow it and who have an interest in this legislation.</P>
        <P>There is further confusion.  I do not know the status of an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by an eminent journalist who obviously spoke directly to the Minister.  She gave him the impression that under the terms of a new Bill to come before the D&aacute;il this week social welfare inspectors will have powers to access bank accounts of people on the dole without their consent.  I presume the article followed a personal interview with the Minister by this reputable journalist.  She must have said something to that effect.  I looked for those provisions in the amendments that have come across my desk by e-mail in recent days but have not seen them.  I do not know whether the provision is included.  Was the Minister thinking of including it when she gave the interview last Thursday or Friday and did she then draw back?  Are the powers already there?  I am not sure but I know it was another spin from the Minister.  Perhaps she felt she was getting flak about the seven year olds and wanted an article in a Sunday paper that would show how she would tackle welfare fraud by introducing these new powers.  She might confirm whether they are to form part of this Bill or that she was only flying a kite in the media over the weekend to detract attention from the substance of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Some of the changes the Minister has proposed today are very serious.  The last one she mentioned offers even further confusion in regard to the Bill.  She stated just now that she would announce on Second Stage that she wanted to introduce amendments on Committee Stage in regard to a household benefits packages for people who are paying rent to the local authority.  These would ensure they could not withdraw their consent without permission of that authority.  They have not even tried to do that.  Consent is consent; people have to give their permission.  This measure would have it that although people give their consent to withdraw from a scheme they voluntarily entered into, they cannot do so without the approval of a State body, namely, the local authority.  Thank God the Attorney General told the Minister where to go with that suggestion.  Last week, she announced in the House she would do it but she found out the situation very quickly when she checked it out.  I wonder if all this legislation is being drafted on the hoof at very short notice.  That will lead to flaws in the legislation and in its implementation and management.</P>
        <P>In regard to some of the changes coming forward, as mentioned by the Minister, I ask her to consider the following point.  I made only a brief reference to it on Second Stage because I saw the Minister&rsquo;s speech only when I was sitting in the Chamber.  I mentioned she was ensuring she would get fully chargeable PRSI on the amounts for those people who will work under the new special assignee relief programme, SARP, which was introduced in the budget as an incentive on the part of the Minister for Finance to facilitate assigning skilled workers in companies from abroad to take up positions in Ireland.  It gave them a certain substantial amount of income tax-free.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, was obviously not happy with that and told the Minister he could exempt such people from PAYE all he liked but she would make sure she got PRSI from them.  Right or wrong, she has taken a diametrically opposed view to the Minister for Finance.  Under SARP there is a provision whereby the Irish taxpayer will pay the private education fees, up to &euro;5,000, for second level education for the children of those employees.  It is a big ask to ask the people to do that and give that special exemption.  However, if the Minister is to be consistent, she should also take PRSI deductions from that &euro;5,000 because it is part of the SARP.  She might reduce the amount via PRSI or charge PRSI by some other mechanism through the tax system as a benefit in kind.  If she believes in what she is doing on the SARP issue she should apply it to the full programme and not be the Minister who will exempt that tax relief from PRSI.  I suspect she would have a difficulty with that in the first place given she is ensuring she will get her PRSI from it at this stage.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the changes she is announcing tonight.  The employer is not liable to deduct employment contributions in certain situations.  We will have to tease out the details of this tomorrow.  The Minister mentioned very many amendments but one I wish to highlight is the entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.  I understand that for people who are in arrears a logical question arises as to how they will get this supplement.  I want to see an amendment to the legislation so that when the person comes out of arrears &mdash; one hopes this is the objective of this exercise &mdash; and into some form of low-paid or other employment, the Minister will make a statutory mechanism to reinstate the mortgage interest supplement for that person.  I have not checked the details of the scheme but presumably people can get the supplement once only, in respect of their first home or the first house they buy.  This may be cancelled if they fall into arrears or have to make an arrangement with their bank but after a year or so they may be back to the same level of income they had in the first place.  They should be entitled to receive the mortgage interest supplement and get back into the scheme.  I suspect there may be a rule somewhere in the system that states a person cannot re-enter the scheme if he or she has availed of it previously.  I put the question; I do not know if that is the case.  The Minister might clarify this during the course of the debate tomorrow when we come to that particular issue.  There are occasions when people cannot apply for a local authority house without a certificate from the tax office.  I cannot remember the name of the form but it is attached to housing application forms and confirms the applicant has not received tax relief at source on a mortgage.  If a person has received it, it proves the person owned a house before and the local authority would check to see what happened to that house and why the person was on the housing list.  People get caught out in various ways.  It is good to know that one can go in and out of the mortgage supplement scheme although I do not know how many times one can do so.  It must be clarified to ensure people can avail of it.</P>
        <P>A major problem is that the Minister is attacking part-time workers by cutting their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  It is a nasty and insidious day&rsquo;s work and many of the Minister&rsquo;s party members will be very sore at this.  When the Fine Gael Party said it would not reduce income tax, the Labour Party had to trump it by promising not to touch mainline social welfare payment rates.  That is why there are insidious plots on people receiving mortgage interest supplement and lone parents.  In order to make necessary savings in the budget, the Minister must go after some of the most vulnerable people.  I am not suggesting there should have been a small cut across the board but it is an option.  Fianna F&aacute;il did it twice and, although people did not like it, they found it fair.  Attacking lone parents and those in part-time work by cutting jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for those in the lowest employment categories is not a nice way of doing it.  The Minister is preserving payments for many people but she is making severe attacks on certain groups.  This motion and the Bill should be withdrawn.  The Minister should come back to us when she has had time to consider it and provide us with an opportunity to consider it in further detail.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Ceann Comhairle asked for an explanatory memorandum on the significant changes to this Bill to be produced.  I acknowledge the work of the officials in producing a detailed document on the amendments.  The briefing on this Bill gave an indication of the expected amendments and their purpose.  Hopefully we can tease out the amendments further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Bill was published on 3 April and the briefing was held the day before the debate on Second Stage commenced, one week ago.  The briefing indicated the level of amendments that would be tabled, some 23 pages.  There are also 23 pages in the Bill, which shows the scale of amendment.  In previous Governments, Members of the Opposition were critical of any Minister who produced another Bill in the form of amendments.  Several were guilty of such a practice.  I always hoped that a different Government would not proceed in the same way.  Then, the Minister spent the first few minutes of the debate trying to excuse the fact that the Bill was not ready.  The Minister said that on April 3 that the Bill she produced was not complete.  The amendments address 12 or 13 areas of social welfare code that are not addressed in the Bill.  The original Bill was produced to address the separate issues of pensions and the disgraceful attack on lone parents and children between the ages of seven and 14.</P>
        <P>I would have been happy if we were discussing a motion to recommit based on the fact that the Minister was withdrawing the Bill or had produced an amendment to give effect to her road to Damascus conversion we heard about last week.  I would have been delighted if she had tabled an amendment to withdraw the odious section.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, the Minister acknowledged that seven years of age is too young.  The excuse given at the start of the debate does not stand up.  I have not come across this procedure so perhaps the Minister can enlighten me.  I presume the deadline of May 2012 could be extended.  A small legislative measure would have allowed an extended timeframe so that a proper Bill could be published with Members having enough time to peruse it.  If that was not possible, as may be the case, the Minister for Social Protection should ask the Minister for Finance not to set unachievable targets.  In the past, the Social Welfare Bill was passed in June or July.  Why was it brought forward?  Is it to gain an extra two months of penny pinching and robbing the poor to pay the IMF?  I do not know.</P>
        <P>I will address some of the amendments signalled in the 23 page document, which we will discuss one by one tomorrow on Committee Stage if this motion is passed.  Some of the amendments are logical and flow from changes in recent years but in respect of others, such as the amendment to the lone parents payment scheme, the Minister should have used the opportunity of her conversion last week and yesterday to introduce a sunrise clause.  The reduction from 14 years to seven should have been made conditional on the provision of after-school care.  The Minister said this is what she would like and there is no opposition to the use of schools or clubs for homework clubs or the non-academic use of schools.  That has been discussed but we have not heard the proposals of the Minister for Education and Skills.  Did the Minister for Social Protection bounce the Minister for Education and Skills into these proposals, telling him they had to be in place in six months?  If the Minister is not going to withdraw this Bill, she should have a sunrise clause on this measure.  She promised she would not introduce the provision in the absence of a bankable commitment on child care.  The commitment is not in writing and is not binding.  There is nothing in the motion or the Bill to make the commitment bankable.  The way to make it bankable is that specific provisions will fall unless certain measures have been put in place based on evidence from the Minister, a committee of the House or an external oversight group.  The Bill does not say the reduction to seven years will start after the Government has made a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of child care.  It certainly does not say the reduction will take place after additional funding or additional affordable child care places have been provided.  What it says is that the cut-off will start to be reduced from 3 May, in a few days.  The Minister has not sought to change the legal reality, despite her promises.  I said last week that this is just a fig leaf and have heard nothing that contradicts this.  It is just another review to kick the issue to touch and then when everything is quiet they will say sorry, but they are going to proceed with it and the Minister has given a commitment to produce after-school and summer holiday care for seven year olds to ensure that those in receipt of lone parents&rsquo; allowance have access to training, work, education and other opportunities that will allow them to go back to full-time work.  We already have the figures on one-parent families and know that the majority of these parents are in some type of paid employment.  Every one of them wants to get back to full-time employment so that they can fully provide for their children and their future.  Their social welfare benefit is not the &ldquo;lifestyle choice&rdquo; people keep talking about.   The Minister herself has spoken of a &ldquo;lifestyle choice&rdquo; in the past.  One only needs to speak to the organisations representing these people to know that or to talk to the parents in that situation.  They will tell the Minister that they would much rather be working full time and be sure their children are cared for.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to deal with some of the other amendments suggested in the amendment pack before us in this motion.  Last week I said that we were absolutely and resolutely opposed to the cuts proposed to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Jobseekers have had their hours reduced as a consequence of the recession, but the Minister is punishing them for being in this predicament.  She claims that some of these people are nervous about entering or re-entering the world of full-time work, despite the fact that columnists of various views agree that any growth in full-time work and full-time job opportunities is a long way off.  I have cited the figures in this regard on a number of occasions.  Even without the single working age change suggested by the Minister, there are currently 50 people on the live register for every vacancy.  In Germany, that figure is 6 to 1.  This just shows that Irish money is going to create jobs in Germany for its people and economy.  We are not benefiting but are suffering greatly.  Justifying her decision to cut jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit when launching the Pathways to Work document, the Minister said: &ldquo;I am trying to ensure that people do not find the security of the social welfare system more attractive than the risky world of work.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Minister and others have talked of economic thinking and have spoken about lifestyle choices, but that mantra is getting old and needs to be put aside.  The Minister must look at the reality.  She must recognise that in many cases employers have been forced to reduce workers&rsquo; hours as a consequence of the recession.  The people whose income this Bill will cut are not plodding along happily in part-time employment.  They are in enforced under-employment.  Through no fault of their own, they have lost part of their jobs.  Does the Minister think it is easy to go out and find a second employer who will be delighted to offer them hours that will fit neatly and precisely into the days they are not currently working or does she think it is easy for them to find full-time employment?  It is not and it will not be any easier for them to get jobs just because the Minister has decided to cut the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Perhaps the Minister is suggesting divine intervention and that by cutting jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, these new jobs will appear magically.</P>
        <P>The only consequence of cutting this benefit is that people who are suffering because of the downturn will be hit in their pockets.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is an insurance-based scheme.  These cuts are an insult to the hard-working people who have accrued entitlements and have now hit hard times.  Our social system needs simplification and I will come back to that when dealing with the amendments.  Will the Minister confirm for me that currently, a person whose working week has been reduced by two days as employers seek to make payroll savings, may be entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit top-up each week of &euro;62.66 and that following these cuts, these people will only be entitled to &euro;37.60?  That is a cut of &euro;25 per week or &euro;1,300 annually.  That is a sizeable drop for any family already suffering as a consequence of reduced hours.</P>
        <P>I will address the issues of mortgage interest supplement and the changes being introduced there and the issue of rent supplement and control measures on Committee Stage.  With regard to the Pension Acts, the whole pension component of this Bill is a missed opportunity.  We could have gone further on this.  Irish pension funds need to be invested in Ireland and I have submitted an amendment in that regard.  Hopefully, we will get to that amendment tomorrow.  I suggest how we can use Irish pension funds and how we can force the pension industry in Ireland to invest more in Irish industry, particularly in a green fund that will ensure, for example, retrofitting can happen.  This would benefit not only the State, but would help address fuel poverty in Ireland and the fact that many homes here lose heat continually.  Retrofitting would also help address our Kyoto commitments.</P>
        <P>I oppose the motion before us on the basis that the Bill should have been withdrawn and a new Bill submitted that would address the Minister&rsquo;s concerns and those of Deputies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject this motion and the Bill out of hand.  It is difficult to stand here and listen to a Minister introduce this Bill and this series of cutbacks and attacks on people who are very poor.  A little more than 12 months ago this Minister would have been on the Opposition benches and would have been hopping mad and dancing a jig in opposition to these amendments and proposals.  It is equally difficult to sit here and listen to the Minister and her party claim some common cause with James Connolly, the great Irish socialist.  There is no doubt in my mind that if James Connolly were to read this Bill, he would turn in his grave.  He would certainly have nothing in common with the Labour Party of today.</P>
        <P>We went through an election a little over 12 months ago and we were told by all the parties contesting it, the Labour Party in particular, that the vulnerable would be protected.  We have seen what that promise meant over the past 14 months.  We have seen a series of attacks and cuts on the lowest paid, on social welfare recipients and on workers generally.  The suggestion and statement that headline rates would be protected was just a shameful and scandalous smokescreen to ensure the dismantling of social welfare benefits hard won by generations of Irish workers and their unions.  That is what is happening in this Bill and what the Government is about.  It is dismantling the supports and social benefits for people in poverty, people who have lost their jobs, lone parents, carers, the disabled and a series of people under severe pressure due to the policies of this and previous Governments.  This Bill provides for reductions in jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and allowances, with jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance reduced to 12 months and illness benefit reduced to two years.  The change from a six-day to five-day week is a direct attack on low paid part-time workers, the majority of whom are women, who are being forced into the workplace and they are now being subjected to further reductions in their weekly income.</P>
        <P>The significant increase in the number of contributions required for State pensions is an attack on women workers in particular who have been out of the workforce of necessity and who may have recently re-entered the workforce.  This is an attack on very vulnerable people who had been out of the workforce.</P>
        <P>The criteria being applied for domiciliary care allowance, disability allowance and invalidity pension are now much more severe with the result that the number of refusals have increased on application or on review.  I refer to the proposed new age limits at which the State pension will be paid and which will result in significant losses in income.  Persons retiring from employment at 65 years will be subject to applying for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which will be means-tested and their employment pension will be means-tested against the allowance which means that for possibly two years they will have no support from the social welfare services.  I reject this motion and the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I too reject this motion and the Bill.  I wish to correct the record of the House.  The Taoiseach said earlier today that the House would have ten hours of debate on Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill but that is not correct because we had four hours&rsquo; debate and at the last moment we are presented with a whole raft of amendments which substantially change the Bill and make it, effectively, a different Bill and a guillotine is imposed.  This makes a mockery of all the talk by this Government when it came into office of a new type of politics, new transparency and real political change.  While I was not a Member of this House at the time, I have been informed by Members who were here in the previous D&aacute;il that the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, when in Opposition, would have been one of the first to complain about the imposition of a guillotine on important legislation.  It is ironic that 14 months on, she is now imposing such a guillotine when Deputies have not had proper time to scrutinise this raft of new amendments.  It defies any credibility to suggest that she has not had sufficient time between the December budget and now, to bring forward these amendments earlier or to include them in the main body of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The one amendment that everyone wanted to see in this Bill is the one amendment the Minister has not brought forward.  The one amendment we would have welcomed, even if late in the day, is the one she has refused to include, to delete section 4, and for her to give up on this disgraceful attempt to cut lone parent payments when children reach the age of seven years.  It is not just that seven is too young, as the Minister acknowledged last week, eight is too young, nine is too young, ten is too young, 11 is too young and 12 is too young.  There is room for discussion after that age but in many cases 13 and 14 is also too young an age at which to leave children on their own when their parents need to go out to work.  It is laughable.</P>
        <P>For a moment when I heard the Minister announce we were to have a Scandinavian model of child care, I thought all of our birthdays had come at once.  However, when I gave it more thought and I talked to a Swedish friend of mine who told me about Scandinavian health care, I suddenly realised that this statement had little meaning and was no more than a smokescreen to try to soften the blow of this disgraceful cut to lone parents&rsquo; payments.  In Scandinavia, there is free child care, almost from birth, from the age of one right up to the age of 14.  It is state-of-the-art child care which is available to everyone.  The notion that the Minister will introduce such a model by December &mdash; much as I would like this to be achieved by December &mdash; is laughable against the background of brutal cuts being demanded under the EU-IMF programme and everything being cut.  I hope the Minister will prove me wrong but it defies credibility.  The only proposal before us, despite the words spoken last week, is the cut which will take immediate effect when the Bill is passed with the possibility that people may be obliged to leave their jobs.  The critical point is that a Government which states it wants labour activation measures is introducing a measure which will drive lone parents out of work and force them into greater dependency on social welfare.  Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill, to accept our amendments to delete section 4.  Let us deliver the Scandinavian model of child care first before the Minister touches lone parents&rsquo; payments.</P>
        <P>The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit amendment is another attack on the low paid and which will disproportionately hit lone parents and women workers again.  It will mean a &euro;20 to &euro;30 a week cut in the earnings of part-time workers, the majority of whom are women and a very significant number of whom are lone parents.  What is the justification for this as it will be a disincentive for people to take up part-time work and may likely force more people out of employment and into dependency on social welfare?  It is another disgraceful move and that amendment should be removed also.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1990 I was forced to rely on social welfare in order to survive.  The worst part of that experience was the constant digs and nagging from the Minister of the time and from politicians, telling people who were on social welfare that they were somewhat useless, not in so many words but, believe me, when I was on it, listening to what they were saying about people on welfare, I pretty much felt useless as all the important people in the country were telling me I was useless because I was on the dole.  That does not encourage anyone to try to get a job.  If the Minister thinks this method of beating people over the head because they are on the dole will get them off the dole, she is wrong.  I have said it before in this House, it is the equivalent of a mother in Africa hitting a slap on her child for not eating its dinner even though there is no food.  No matter how many times the child is hit, there is nothing to eat.  There is nothing these people on the dole can do because there are no jobs.</P>
        <P>The Minister talks about headline rates, but what exactly are they?  Are they the rates that people see who do not read too deeply into what is happening?  What difference does it make to people on social welfare when the Minister says she did not cut headline rates, but their fuel and rent allowances were cut?</P>
        <P>Given that this is all about political spin, I have a suggestion for the Minister.  Why did she not put social welfare up by 1 cent and cut the rent and fuel allowances?  The Minister could then have got a headline which said: &ldquo;Social welfare rates have risen under this Government.  Aren&rsquo;t we wonderful?&rdquo;  That is the way the Government works.</P>
        <P>When I heard that amendments would be tabled to this Bill I thought it was brilliant because people like single parents were being listened to.  I met them last week and I was impressed by their phenomenally good argument as to why the Minister should not do what she is planning to do.  For a start, this measure does not save the Government at all; in fact, it just discourages people from working.  There are no jobs for these people to take up in the first place.  Without child care, how can they afford to take up a job if it comes their way?</P>
        <P>I met yesterday with a group of people on one of these new wonderful courses the Minister has put them on.  I asked them if they would be on such a course if they had not been forced to do it, and they said they would not.  They felt it was an utter waste of time.  The person who was giving the course told me they had to make it up as they went along, but they did it because it reduced numbers on the dole.  It may have looked good for the Government but what good did it do for those on the courses?  What good will it do for someone who is doing a brilliant job of minding their child at home if they are forced onto a course that is not worth a damn or into a job that does not exist?  This does not make any sense whatsoever.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that we might get some kind of Scandinavian world-class child care system but I did not think she would do it for a second because it is not possible.  At a meeting today, one of the Minister&rsquo;s party colleagues, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, said we are starting from a very low base.  We are starting from such a low base that this cannot happen within the timeframe the Minister is proposing.  She will not only force people to send their children out on the street at the age of seven &mdash; although people will not do that &mdash; but she is raising their hopes about something that will not happen.  If it is not going to happen, it is irresponsible of the Minister to say it will.  It has taken the Scandinavian countries decades to get this right, so I do not think the Minister will solve it in 18 months.  It is not possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Minister really wants to help those on social welfare, she should try to create some jobs.  She should also put in place a decent child care system which people can afford.  Instead, however, the Minister is creating circumstances whereby many community facilities are closing down.  She is travelling in the opposite direction to the promises she has made.  It is not on.  She is supposed to be the Minister for Social Protection, not &mdash; to steal Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s quote &mdash; the Minister for social destruction.</P>

    <Title>Motorist Emergency Relief Bill 2012: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I will be sharing time.  Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward this Bill as an exceptional measure to deal with a crisis facing hundreds and thousands of motorists throughout the country.  The price of petrol and diesel, which has been increasing steadily over the past year, is being raised with me and other Members of this House on an almost weekly basis.  Motorists are at their wits end.  Families are at breaking point.  The steady increase in the price of oil is placing an unbearable burden on so many people throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>This Bill, Second Stage of which it is hoped will be passed by the House tomorrow evening, seeks to reduce the price of petrol and diesel on the forecourt by 5 cent.  The mechanism in this Bill which we envisage being used by the Government to achieve the 5 cent reduction is a 4% reduction in excise duty and the corresponding VAT forgone, resulting in a 5 cent reduction.  It is clear that there is an unbearable burden on so many motorists.  The director of policy with AA Ireland, Mr. Conor Faughnan, has stated that feedback from the association&rsquo;s regular motorists&rsquo; survey reveals the heavy cost to commuting mortgage holders.  He also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Motorists have told us that they are in negative equity in a house 40 miles from Dublin and commute to work in order to pay an outrageous or onerous mortgage.  Some have actually quit their job because it was not adding up for them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He further stated that while people who bought a house in 2007-2008, when their budget looked sound, were paying &euro;142 for petrol in January 2009, they are now paying &euro;300 per month, which is crucifying them.</P>
        <P>Motorists make a huge contribution to the Exchequer, paying more than &euro;4 billion per annum in excise duty, VRT, VAT and motor tax.  Next year, that contribution will be in excess of 10% of the revenue generated by the State, an exceptional burden on one particular sector.  It is for this reason that we believe there is a necessity to act and to do so swiftly.  Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for a relatively modest reduction in excise duty and is seeking to achieve this in a way which will address the current spike in oil prices.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il proposal also calls for a review of fuel prices every three months rather than annually as is currently the case.  It does not make sense to only have a review of fuel prices once a year at budget time when the cost of oil on the world market is changing all the time.  The Government needs flexibility to respond to this on a regular basis.  The legislation we are proposing would allow the Government to react quickly to developing situations in the marketplace.  We estimate that the cost in terms of revenue forgone would be approximately &euro;145 million.  However, the State is currently taking in substantial additional VAT revenue from the spike in fuel prices.  The burden of increased motoring costs is, as stated by the Minister for Finance in the House last week in response to a parliamentary question, having a significant dampening effect on the domestic economy.  I will deal with this issue later in my contribution.</P>
        <P>As we enter the peak summer driving season, the need to give hard pressed motorists a break is becoming more acute.  If this legislation is passed it will bring immediate relief to thousands of motorists, farmers and small businesses across the country.  People feel they are being squeezed from every angle.  The rapidly rising price of fuel is another cost they simply cannot afford.  An instant reduction at the pumps would have a significant impact on household budgets.  We are all aware that fuel prices in Ireland have risen steadily since January 2009.  Since the deregulation of fuel prices in October 1991, AA Ireland has produced a useful monthly national average.  This data shows that in January 2009 prices hit a low point of 94.6 cent for petrol and 94.4 cent for diesel.  According to AA Ireland&rsquo;s April survey since then, prices have risen to 164.9 cent for petrol and 159.9 cent for diesel, representing an increase of 75% in petrol prices and 70% in diesel prices over that period, which is a phenomenal increase on a commodity which is such an essential part of every day life for so many people.  If anything, prices have worsened since that survey was done.  The website <i>pumps.ie</i> shows that retailers are charging 169.9 cent for petrol and 164.9 cent diesel.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledges that fuel prices are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices during the recent past reflected additional factors such as the geopolitical uncertainty in North Africa and the Middle East, with potential supply disruptions.  The uncertainty in stock markets and the real estate sector have seen investors shift emphasis towards commodity markets and oil, gold and other extracts have seen significant increases as a result of that shift in investor sentiment.  However, the State also has a significant influence on the price of motor fuel.  Ireland&rsquo;s excise rates are 9th and 4th highest in the EU 27 for petrol and auto-diesel respectively.  In its budget, the Government increased the carbon levy on fuel by &euro;5 per tonne of CO2 and VAT by 2%.  Some 54% of the cost of petrol and almost 50% of the cost of diesel accrues to the State.  The loss of disposable income from increased motor taxes affects almost all households and businesses because it is a rise in a basic cost of living, taxed as if it were a luxury.</P>
        <P>I am not blaming the current Government for this.  This has been one of the old reliables for successive governments.  Tonight is about trying to establish where we are at and recognising that the current price of oil is unsustainable and is creating an unsustainable burden on this economy and the people who live in it.  The Automobile Association calculates that a car doing about 12,000 miles per year &mdash; which is a limited amount for many people in this House &mdash; based on a fuel economy rate of 30 miles per gallon would utilise approximately 150 litres of fuel per month.  For petrol users, the monthly bill is now &euro;247.35 while it is &euro;239.85 for diesel users.  The monthly cost for petrol and diesel users since April last year is &euro;28 and &euro;22 more per month, respectively.</P>
        <P>Since the budget of October 2008 and the first budget announced by this Government last December there have been five separate tax increases on both fuels, which between them adds approximately 22 cent per litre to the retail price.  Were it not for those tax increases, the price of petrol would be &euro;1.42 per litre and diesel would be &euro;1.37 per litre.  The cumulative effect of these measures is that for an ordinary family the tax on fuel is now &euro;396 per annum higher, which is a significant amount.  High fuel prices have a particularly negative impact on rural communities where there is a lack of alternative public transport options.  In this regard, I point not only to people living in rural communities, but to the many people who commute to work from commuter belt communities on a daily basis, often travelling a distance much greater than the average 12,000 miles per annum mentioned earlier.  Many of those people will travel 25,000 to 30,000 miles per annum.</P>
        <P>Within Europe, Ireland already has comparatively high electricity and fuel costs.  While it lacks the major energy intensive industries which would result in competitiveness being severely impacted by oil and gas prices, the cost of energy and fuel is a factor in relation to the operational costs of business and associated investment decisions.  In this regard, I understand the Irish Road Haulage Association has entered into dialogue with the Government through a working group established with the Department of Finance, which is welcome.  However, I spoke with hauliers today and they do not believe that the Government or Department of Finance is addressing the issue as expeditiously as they need to.  They believe there is a level of delay and non-engagement.  I understand they are due to meet tomorrow.  However, they do not believe there is an understanding at Government level of the benefits associated with the rebate which they have talked about and, in particular, of the urgent need to address the laundering of diesel which is creating an exceptionally uncompetitive environment for genuine hauliers.  I urge the Minister to bring forward some measures to address this issue at the earliest possible opportunity.  Fianna F&aacute;il is happy to be of assistance to Government and to bring forward such measures, much as it is happy to bring forward this legislation tonight.  I can assure the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, that if the Government does not move to meet the demands of the Irish Road Haulage Association and does not show a clear understanding of the issue in terms of its impact on the competitiveness of this State, Fianna F&aacute;il will bring forward legislation.  We are already working on that legislation.  I will be happy to share with the House in due course our recommendations and solutions to this difficult problem.</P>
        <P>On 18 April, the Minister for Finance, in response to a question, spoke about this issue in relation to the additional revenue that the State generates as a result of VAT being levied on the base price of oil.</P>
        <P>He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is reallocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I dispute that conclusion, as do my colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, indicated in the House recently that in excess of &euro;1 million accrues to the State each week as a result of the increased rate of VAT that is applied to the base oil price.  He suggested that between &euro;64 million and &euro;70 million accrues to the State each year as a result.  I am delighted that has been recognised by someone in the Minister of State&rsquo;s position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected the Minister of State to have a particular focus on small and medium sized enterprises, which are most affected by the increased cost of fuel.  If we accept that the Minister for Finance is right in his contention, which I have outlined, surely the converse is also true and a reduction in tax on oil would increase spending in other areas of the economy.  If we follow the converse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What happened during the 14 years that the Deputy&rsquo;s party spent in government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is taking that tax and putting it into much more labour-intensive areas of the economy.  Deputy Perry is very familiar with the retail sector.  Retail Excellence Ireland paid a great deal of attention to what it was promised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party when they were in opposition.  The parties in question suggested they had the capacity to address the issue of upward-only rent reviews in a retrospective manner.  They fell flat on their faces in that regard when they came into office.  We can leave that aside.  Now that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are in government, they should listen to what Retail Excellence Ireland is saying about the dampening effect of the increase in oil prices on the spend in the retail sector.  It is having a devastating impact.  I ask the Minister of State to address that at the earliest opportunity.  There is a potential gain here regardless of whether one accepts the Minister of State&rsquo;s point of view or that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a study that was recently conducted by the FairFuel UK campaign, which has been highlighting the potential positive impact on the UK economy of a reduction in fuel duty there.  The proposal works on the basis that a reduction of 2.5p in fuel duty would result in the creation of thousands of jobs within a year, without any fiscal loss to the UK Government.  It has been estimated that such a reduction would lead to a GDP increase of approximately 0.32% in a year and a GDP increase of approximately 0.34% over five years.  If an extrapolation of that analysis is applied to the measure we are proposing in this legislation, we estimate that our suggestion could lead to a potential increase of approximately 0.5% of this country&rsquo;s GDP.  That would result in an additional gain to the State of approximately &euro;750 million.  The Minister for Finance has pointed out that the cost of this measure would be approximately &euro;145 million, but the potential gain is approximately &euro;750 million.  I do not suggest that the entire &euro;750 million would come all at once.  It is certainly worth a gamble.</P>
        <P>The Government took a similar gamble when it reduced the rate of VAT that applies to the tourism sector by 4%.  By its own admission, and on the basis of all the figures coming from the various industry sources, that measure worked.  I am prepared to accept that it worked.  I ask the Government to introduce a similar measure in this sector.  I believe the measure we are proposing is conservative.  Many people in my party wanted me to propose a reduction of 20 cent or 30 cent because they felt it would be more meaningful.  I did not believe such a proposal could be costed, or indeed borne by the State in the current climate.  I believe we have an opportunity to reduce the level of excise that is charged on a litre of fuel by 5 cent.  I believe that can be costed, based on the numbers we have made available and the analysis in the study that was carried out in our nearest neighbour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I congratulate Deputy Dooley on the imaginative legislation he has introduced to try to deal with escalating fuel prices.  I do not expect queues to run from the forecourts down the streets of this country tomorrow evening as people wait to see whether this Bill will be accepted by Deputies when the bells toll in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister for Finance roundly rejected it this morning without giving the actual debate in this House a hearing.  He decided to summarily reject a proposal that was to be made in this Chamber without waiting to listen to the debate on it.  As a result, he is not in a position to benefit from the common sense approach of Deputy Dooley and others to the question of how and, more importantly, why we should deal with the escalation in fuel prices.  I genuinely thought this proposal would get a bit of hearing.  I sat on the Government benches on Wednesday, 4 June 2008 when the then Leader of the Opposition almost fell over as he spoke passionately, with tears of sadness in his eyes, about hard-pressed trawlermen, truck drivers and motorists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That must have been when the Deputy decided he wanted to be in opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I genuinely believed every word he said.  He spoke about the need to help hard-pressed workers, trawlermen, hauliers and others who were finding it very difficult to survive in the straitened economic times of June 2008.  Nothing has improved since then, by any stretch of the imagination.  Fuel prices have continued to escalate to the extent that a litre of diesel now costs &euro;1.70.  Ordinary people cannot afford it any more.  Such an exorbitant tax on fuel is a tax on people who are trying to go to work, to commute and to pay their bills.  It is distorting the take-home pay of those who are in work.  It is creating a poverty trap.  Some people have realised that it might not pay them to drive to work.  The Minister of State knows rural Ireland as well as I do.  He appreciates that people in many towns and villages in rural Ireland cannot use public transport to get from A to B.  People have to travel to work in order to pay their bills.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to consider this legislation in a positive manner.  When the Government did its sums in advance of budget 2012, it assumed it would take in a certain level of revenue from fuel and oil prices.  The Government will take in more than it had planned because those prices have increased.  Why can it not give a little of the additional revenue back?  We are asking for a reduction of 5 cent a litre.  We are proposing a reduction of 4 cent in excise duty and of 1 cent in VAT.  That could have a meaningful impact.  The problem with this Government was highlighted by the then Leader of the Opposition in 2008 when he said that people lose touch very quickly after they get into power.  When they sit into their cars, they have already been filled with fuel.  They do not have to worry too much about it as they are driven around the countryside.  We recently listened to Ministers saying that the household charge would amount to just &euro;2 a week.  They did not seem to appreciate that many people cannot afford the basics.  I know of cases of people ordering home heating oil by the litre, as opposed to the hundreds of litres they used to order a few years ago.</P>
        <P>The proposal before the House should be given some thought.  It deserves an airing and a hearing.  I ask the Government to think about it over the next 24 hours.  We need to give some relief to people who are under financial stress and pressure.  Some of those who leave home early in the morning and return late at night are deciding whether it is worth their while having to travel long distances to go to work.  A poverty trap is developing as a consequence of escalating fuel prices.  This problem is particularly evident among lower-paid people who have to commute long distances.  As Deputy Dooley pointed out, the Government has tried to stimulate job creation in the tourism sector by reducing VAT in that sector.  If that is working in the tourism sector, it will also work in the fuel sector.  If the price of fuel were reduced by a certain amount, people would get a little bit of breathing space.  They might spend it on something else.  They might pay a bill or they might buy something.  The principle we are advocating is the same one that underpins the reduction in VAT in the tourism sector, which the Government considers to be one of its finest job stimulus packages since it came into office.  I believe it might have the same result in this case.  It might give people some breathing space, hope and confidence.  We need to make sure it pays them to sit into their cars each day and drive to work in return for a fair day&rsquo;s pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a contribution to the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  I commend our transport spokesperson, Deputy Timmy Dooley, on producing it.  Very often, the Members of this House are accused of discussing issues that are not relevant to what is occurring outside.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle know the cost of fuel is being discussed by every family in the country.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to offer some relief to motorists.  The Bill, as Deputy Dooley outlined, is a modest measure, but it would be helpful.  The cost of fuel represents a crisis and it is having a tangible impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  In this regard, I fully agree with Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s statement on the choices people must make.  Many people have to commute 20 to 40 miles to work every day.  The fuel cost incurred by them on return journeys five or six days per week is crippling.  It is affecting every element of their household budgets and every spending decision they make.  The price of fuel makes an enormous difference to them.</P>
        <P>Consider the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage people to holiday at home, which we support.  If a family is considering the options of taking a cheap flight abroad to spend a week in France, Spain or elsewhere and touring around Ireland, it must consider the cost of fuel here.  The Government is advocating policies that are clearly inconsistent and incompatible with one another.  On a micro-economic level, day-to-day trips that people must make to see parents who live 30 or 40 miles away, friends or people in hospital and voluntary trips to support soccer, hurling and rugby teams are all affected by the price of fuel.  Nobody can deny this.  The price is having a real impact on the lives of the people and a depressing effect on the wider economy.</P>
        <P>This is a modest stimulus proposal.  It is true, as Deputy Dooley stated, that Fianna F&aacute;il in government increased taxation on fuel on a number of occasions since 2008.  The  current Government speakers will put this on the record over the course of this debate but none of those taxation measures brought the costs to &euro;1.70 per litre of petrol and &euro;1.60 per litre of diesel.  We have now reached a tipping point that is affecting not only individual consumers and those involved in commercial transport but also the wider economy.  The figures I have quoted are not outliers; they are confirmed as average by the website <i>www.pumps.ie</i>, the advocacy website, which states the average cost of petrol is now &euro;1.69 per litre and the average cost of diesel is &euro;1.59 per litre.</P>
        <P>As Mr. Conor Faughnan of the AA has pointed out, there are three key drivers to the price of fuel that people pay at the forecourt.  The first is the exchange rate.  As we know, the euro has weakened recently.  The second is the cost of crude oil and the third is  Government-imposed taxes.  It is disingenuous of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, or any other Minister to state the  Government does not have an influence on the cost of fuel.  People know this to be false because the reality is that approximately 54% of the cost of a litre of petrol at the pumps goes into the State coffers.  There are three elements: excise duty; carbon tax; and VAT.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kelleher referred to a statement made by the former leader of the Opposition, now the Taoiseach, in June 2008.  He made a song and dance about the cost of fuel at the time and stated it was a battering ram against hard-pressed consumers.  This was at a time when the cost of petrol was &euro;1.30.  It is now &euro;1.70.  If the Taoiseach believed it was a battering ram against hard-pressed consumers then, what does he believe it is now?  I would like him to come into this House and tell Members what he believes the impact to be.</P>
        <P>I want to anticipate what I believe will be the main criticism of this Bill by members on the  Government side; they will ask how it would be funded.  Deputy Dooley referred to this issue.  The growth cost in terms of revenue forgone is calculated by the Department of Finance at approximately &euro;145 million.  We believe the net impact on the Exchequer of this measure will be minimal.  In support of that, let me quote the statement by the Minister for Finance in the D&aacute;il last week.  A colleague of the Minister, Deputy Stanton, tabled a parliamentary question on hauliers and what is being done to alleviate some of their problems, and I took up the issue of ordinary consumers.  The Minister denied there is any windfall for the State in net terms from the high cost of fuel.  In response to my question, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">What happens is that people who have to use their car to get to work will make savings elsewhere.  In other words, they are spending more on fuel and less on something else.  While the Exchequer takes an additional amount on VAT from fuel, it loses VAT on other parts of the spending profile.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the point.  If the Minister accuses Fianna F&aacute;il of dreaming today, he must have been dreaming last week.  What we are proposing espouses exactly the same logic outlined by the Minister in this House last week, namely, that if one frees up some of the money being spent by consumers on fuel and allows them to spend it in other sectors of the economy &mdash; more productive sectors that are labour-intensive and sectors such as the retail and tourism sectors &mdash; there will be a better return.  That is what we propose.  In no way can anybody suggest this measure will cost the State &euro;145 million.  That is rubbish.  Would it not be great if the people had a few more bob in their pockets to spend in the shops, go out for a meal with their families or take a trip over the weekend?  That would benefit the wider economy and that is what Fianna F&aacute;il proposes in its Bill.</P>
        <P>When the Government signed up to the new deal in respect of the 2012 promissory note payment, it incurred an extra &euro;90 million in interest for 2012.  Therefore, I asked the Minister last week where he would get the &euro;90 million.  The answer was that, in the grand scheme of things, the matter would resolve itself and the &euro;90 million would fall into the overall picture in the public finances.  There is no way that the net cost of what we are proposing is anything like &euro;90 million.  Therefore, I reject the flippant manner in which the Government has rubbished the proposal of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We are making very sensible proposals in respect of the public finances.</P>
        <P>This measure will have an impact on consumer confidence.  If the logic of the Government were extended and the cost of a barrel of crude oil returned to the level in 2008, at which time it was at a record $148, the price of petrol at the pumps would rise to &euro;2 per litre.  Is there any point at which the Government will say enough is enough and that the State should not be benefiting from the crucifying price being charged at the petrol pumps?  The logic of what the Government is saying is that it will not intervene at any point.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dooley outlined the contribution of motorists to the Exchequer, which is enormous every year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, will no doubt refer in his reply to an agreement that Fianna F&aacute;il signed up to in Europe not to revisit in a temporary way taxes on fuel because of any spike in the international price of oil.  One reason the European Union is so unpopular is that it is not prepared to respond to the needs of its citizens.  With the price of fuel as it is today, there is an obvious need not only for this Administration but also for other countries in Europe to respond with imaginative measures and a flexible tool such as the taxation system.  As we all know, all it takes is a decision of this House to reduce the excise duty on fuel, which decision would take effect at midnight on the night of the decision.  There are no administrative barriers to my proposal, therefore.</P>
        <P>I am sure other colleagues will deal with the issues that affect hauliers and commercial motorists.  Those issues are very serious, so much so that we did not want to involve them in this Bill.  However, hauliers and commercial motorists will benefit if this Bill is accepted.  While they can claim back VAT, they cannot claim back excise duty on fuel.  A 4 cent reduction on the excise element would be of huge benefit to anyone involved in transporting goods throughout the country commercially.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We ask the Minister of State to take a second look at this measure, which we believe is proportionate, modest and sensible.  Its net impact on the Exchequer is minimal.  We know from looking at the EUROSTAT figures yesterday that we are heading towards a deficit of no more than 8.2% in 2012.  Therefore, there is headroom for the Government to do as proposed.  It is a matter for Government to set the priorities within the overall budgetary parameters and the scope is there to do so.  If the Minister believes it is enough of a priority, he has the power to do it and we urge him to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I commend Deputy Dooley on bringing forward the Bill.  It is a little over 12 months since the last general election, including the rhetoric of that election, the rhetoric of the Opposition at that time and the promises and commitments made to the electorate during that election campaign.  What a short space of time has passed for the members of the current Government, including the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and others, to become glove puppets of their Departments.</P>
        <P>Little is now being said about the citizens of the State and how they are being treated or cheated, about new politics and about new economic policies.  It is more of the same.  Little change is taking place.  That was seen tonight in the comments by the Minister for Finance which poked fun at the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for bringing forward this proposition.  I thought little of that.  I often get a bit of fun out of some of the comical remarks and quips by the Minister for Finance but on this occasion, he showed a complete lack of understanding of the plight of the ordinary person who is going to work every day and is trying to make a living.  He showed very little understanding of the need for a departure in some way to support the individual who is trying to make ends meet.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister for Finance consider that those who commute to work are doing a lot more for less, that getting to work is costing them much more in the first place and that a little relief, even that suggested this evening, would be a big deal to them?  As they restructure their lives, their attitudes towards work and the cost of getting to work, how they live and what they purchase, it would seem that the State does not care.  It has no policy to support, or has no intention of supporting, the ordinary individual and family which is hard-pressed.  Instead we get a break down of the maths in that it will only cost an extra &euro;2 per week.  When the Government is introducing policy, whether in regard household charges or otherwise, we are told it will not be a great burden on a family or an individual.  However, no one adds up the cost to a family.  It is easy to add up these costs, as has been done by previous speakers.  When one adds up the cost, it is a huge burden on perhaps the one individual in the household who is working to put fuel in the car to go to work.  All he or she is asking for is a little relief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What about the unemployed person who we are insisting goes on various courses?  In rural Ireland, they are not easily available and one must travel to those courses.  We are asking that person, who does not have access to public transport, to pay much more than a person living in a city with public transport.  No consideration at all is being given to such people from whom other benefits are being cut.  The Government promised it would be different and yet it adds further costs to the cost of their lives and to the cost of what they do.  No consideration whatsoever is being given to them but it still insists that they do courses in various centres.  I do not condemn that but I condemn the fact that the Government gives no consideration to this proposition this evening to, in some way, alleviate their pain.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister for Finance consider the long waiting lists in hospitals and the number of times people must visit hospitals for check-ups and consideration of one kind or another?  It is usually those who are elderly or marginalised who must think about these things much more.  Would he consider the fact that in many of those families and in many of those cases where people are marginalised, they adjust what they eat and they think twice about every cent they spend?  The Minister had no regard in his &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news clip quip for those people.  He showed the height of disregard for them and a disrespect I would not have expected from him.  I do not mind him condemning politically what we are trying to do but I mind what he said about those people because it did not go down well with them and it certainly has not gone down well with me.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask about the hauliers.  Some 1,500 trucks carry 80% of the country&rsquo;s goods and 95% of the country&rsquo;s export, as outlined by the hauliers themselves.  I have a vested interest here because that is my background and I make no apology for that.  Hauliers have seen 1,300 truck licences being dropped in the past few years and have seen their costs soar.  What is misunderstood, or not understood at all, by this Government is the fact that those businesses are generally family-owned and employ a large number of people in a local community and contribute very positively to the economy.  The Government refuses to consider what other countries are doing for hauliers and it refuses to give them a break in terms of their commitment to their colleagues and the people they employ.  That is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is one of the few who continues to talk about small businesses.  How can he say a working group will deal with the Irish Road Haulage Association and the haulage industry?  I understand it will meet tomorrow.  As the  working group progresses, small companies and family-owned businesses employing small numbers of people are going broke.  They are travelling to the Continent to fill up with diesel to come back to put it into tanks.  They then travel back to the Continent to fill up again.</P>
        <P>This proposition is a small amount of money in the scheme of things and it could easily be replaced if the Government cut the costs to allow the hauliers to fill up at home.  It should for once show an understanding of the case being made by an organisation which is keeping the country going.  Diesel surcharges are being placed on companies and they are passing them on to the end-user, the consumer, including the shops on high streets whose businesses are bleeding and which have nothing else to offer the economy.  The Government shows them no understanding whatsoever.  It has turned its back on the business world and has left it to sweat and to lose jobs.  It has refused to assist it.  It has increased VAT and has refused to consider propositions such as this.  It is acting in the most arrogant manner I have ever seen.  When in opposition it often accused the last Government of being arrogant but it could be argued it took 15 years to become arrogant while it took this one less than 12 months.</P>
        <P>I for one am deeply disappointed with the response to this proposition and the response generally to business people in this country and to ordinary citizens who are so hard pressed that they cannot meet their costs.  The Government does not understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is opposing the Motorist Emergency Relief Bill 2012 sponsored by Deputy Dooley to provide for quarterly reviews of excise duty and the immediate reduction of 4 cent in excise duties on petrol and auto-diesel.  In the context of our current budgetary situation, there is no scope to reduce the levels of excise duties at this time without providing for alternative revenue raising measures.  Such a measure would cost the Exchequer &euro;178 million in a full year when VAT is taken into account.  The loss of this Revenue would have a negative impact on the performance of our public finances, which is vital to our economic well-being and to our exiting the EU-IMF programme.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been running large public finance deficits since 2008, significantly driving up the country&rsquo;s debt level.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This is the backdrop framing our budgetary policy.  We cannot consistently spend more than we collect in revenue each year.  It is not sustainable.  Conversely, we cannot reduce taxes or excises without introducing additional taxes or charges in other areas to replace the tax forgone.  The Government is determined to correct the public finances, enhance economic growth prospects and create jobs.  Contrary to Deputy McGuinness&rsquo;s remarks, the Government has a clear understanding of and concern and respect for business people.  Had he the courtesy to await my reply, he would have been given the facts.  The difficulties we are dealing with are the legacy of the previous Government, which bankrupted the country.  That is the fact.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was highly critical of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s arrogance and economic legacy, the latter of which has forced business people to reduce job numbers.  This point should be made clearly.</P>
        <P>This Government is concerned with creating jobs and putting the country back on the road to recovery.  It is not an easy task, despite the assertions by Deputies to whom I listened with agitation because of their memory loss.  Their track record is one of arrogantly dominating and disrespecting small companies.  Our public finances are stabilising.  Figures released by EUROSTAT yesterday showed our underlying deficit in 2011 was at 9.4% of GDP and we were on the right trajectory towards meeting our 8.6% target in 2012 and correcting our excessive deficit by 2015.  We are committed to this.  To that end, a stable tax base is essential.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, a sizeable deficit in our public finances remains.  This year, the limit placed on the general government deficit is 8.6% of GDP.  At budget time, it was estimated that such a limit equated to a difference of almost &euro;13.75 billion between revenues and expenditure.  It is important that we deal with this deficit.  Clearly, &euro;13.75 billion is an elevated level and requires further corrective action.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dooley raised a point about my statement last week.  To correct the record, during a Topical Issue debate Deputy Naughten cited a net gain of &euro;64 million as a result of VAT increases.  Although I seemed to acknowledge his point, there was no fact to support that figure.  According to Deputy Dooley, I stated that &euro;1 million would accrue from the increase, but Deputy Naughten raised the issue, not I.</P>

	<P>During a Topical Issue debate in the Chamber last week, Deputy Naughten stated the figure of &euro;64 million and I addressed him in that context without the facts.</P>
        <P>Last year saw a return to aggregate tax revenue growth for the first time since 2007.  Exchequer data for the first three months of this year show a solid start to the year, with strong year-on-year growth in taxes.  Taxes were also ahead of profile in the first quarter.  Given the size of the gap between expenditure and revenues, it is clear that the adjustment process must continue on both sides of the account and the performance of tax revenues in the first quarter of the year is positive in that context.</P>
        <P>The Government would be reluctant to introduce any measure at this point that might cost the Exchequer tax revenues.  As the Deputy will appreciate, framing a budget is about making choices and introducing measures that are fair, equitable and robust.  In this regard, the Government decided to maintain income tax levels, to remove more than 330,000 people from the scope of the universal social charge and to increase mortgage interest relief for home owners who bought their first homes during the 2004-08 period.  The Government introduced compensating measures elsewhere in the tax system to finance such measures and our tax forecasts are robust, as highlighted in the first quarter Exchequer returns.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that a reduction in excise on petrol and auto-diesel of 4 cent per litre would cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;143 million in a full year and some &euro;94 million this year, if applied from May.  This amounts to &euro;178 million in a full year or &euro;119 million this year when VAT is taken into account.  Without compensating adjustment measures elsewhere, this would make the achievement of our budgetary targets more challenging.</P>
        <P>All of the quantitative fiscal targets set as part of the EU-IMF programme have been achieved and we are making good progress in returning our public finances to sustainability.  It is important that we persist on this path and that we continue to meet the targets we have been set.  Clearly the budgetary adjustment process presents challenges for policy makers, but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to meeting our budgetary targets.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in this regard.  It is important that we remain on a credible path of budgetary adjustment.  Moving towards a balanced budgetary position is a necessary pre-condition for restoring the economy to sustainable growth and securing our re-entry to the international financial markets to source financing.</P>
        <P>We fully appreciate that fuel prices are high and represent a significant financial burden on families.  Fuel is a significant cost for people travelling to work and those involved in creating jobs.  As with elsewhere, Ireland has experienced a significant increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel in recent years.  The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon.  They are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices in recent times reflected additional factors, such as geopolitical uncertainty in north Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the average price of auto-diesel was &euro;1.23 per litre compared with today&rsquo;s average price of &euro;1.61 per litre, a difference of 38 cent per litre.  It is important to put on record the fact that, during this period, budget 2011&rsquo;s excise increases and budget 2012&rsquo;s carbon tax increases raised excise on auto-diesel by just over 3.5 cent per litre, VAT inclusive.  Therefore, the increase in the price of auto-diesel is largely due to external factors outside the Government&rsquo;s control.</P>
        <P>Including the carbon charge, excise rates on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel.  When VAT is taken into account, the total Exchequer take, as a percentage of the total price, is 53.7% and 48.5% based on current average prices of &euro;1.68 and &euro;1.61 per litre for petrol and auto-diesel, respectively.  While the tax increases are within the control of the Government, they must be seen in the context of difficult budgetary decisions.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners&rsquo; and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour&rsquo;s, the UK.  Indeed, the price of auto-diesel is approximately 20 cent per litre less in this State than it is in the UK while the price of petrol is approximately 10 cent per litre cheaper.</P>
        <P>As excise is set at a nominal amount, the Exchequer&rsquo;s yield from it does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  As VAT is set as a percentage of the price, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel increases as the price of fuels increase.  Accordingly, any increase in the tax take as a consequence of increasing fuel prices is confined to VAT.  Opposition Members have been claiming that the VAT gain on increased fuel prices is approximately &euro;60 million.  I am advised by Revenue that, based on current fuel prices and current demand, the increased VAT take would be more in the order of &euro;15.5 million per annum.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil, or green diesel as it is commonly known, used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the VAT system.  VAT on petrol cannot be deducted or reclaimed.  For example, at current average auto-diesel prices, a business can reclaim VAT of just over 30 cent per litre, thereby reducing the cost to the business from &euro;1.61 to &euro;1.31 per litre on average.  That is the net cost when VAT is removed.  People are not fully aware of that.</P>
        <P>Given the current pressure on the public finances there is no scope for temporary taxation adjustments because they could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.  The programme for Government has stated that income tax will not be increased.  The Government carefully considered the options open to it in the context of our commitments under the EU-IMF programme.  Indirect taxes have a lower impact on economic growth and jobs.  Accordingly, revenue raising in budget 2012 was largely in the areas of indirect taxes, including VAT and carbon tax.  The decision to increase the carbon tax by &euro;5 per tonne meant a lower increase across all fuels than if an increase had been applied solely on excise duties on petrol and diesel.</P>
        <P>The rising cost of fuel is an international phenomenon.  In this regard it should be noted that in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices last spiked, former Ministers for Finance subscribed to the approach agreed at ECOFIN.  In light of the impact high oil prices can have on growth rates it was agreed that distorting fiscal and other policy interventions which prevent the necessary adjustments by economic agents should be avoided.  That was the policy of a Government in which Deputy Dooley was a member.  On 15 March 2011 the issue of rising fuel prices was briefly discussed by EU Finance Ministers and they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and 2008.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, given the kind of adjustment we have to implement we cannot start dismantling the budget three months into the year.  It is irresponsible of Fianna F&aacute;il to expect us to dismantle the budget without proposing alternative revenue sources.  For the reasons I have outlined, I oppose the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="HeatherHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Heather Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Motorist Emergency Relief Bill 2012.  There has been a sharp rise in the cost of fuel in recent times largely due to external factors such as the price of oil internationally.  This is not a new phenomenon, however, because it has always been inevitable that if the price of a barrel of oil went up the cost of petrol and diesel would follow suit.  This is exactly what has been happening in recent times mainly due to political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa and the potential for disruption in supply as a result of these conflicts.</P>
        <P>The excise rates for petrol and diesel were increased in December&rsquo;s budget following the increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from &euro;15 to &euro;20 per tonne.  This represents an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre for petrol and slightly over 1.5 cent for diesel.  As the memorandum of understanding with the troika, which the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government signed the country up to, commits us to a carbon tax increase, these increases were unavoidable.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that after 15 years of inaction while in government Fianna F&aacute;il has now decided to raise the issue of the fuel market.  It was not as quick to act on the long running problems of fuel laundering and washed diesel which became rampant during its tenure in office.  My own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is probably the region that is worst affected by these problems.  It is for this reason that Monaghan County Council was called before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht earlier this year.  Over the period from 2004 to January 2012 Monaghan County Council has dealt with over 150 separate incidents of diesel wash dumping.  These incidents require the involvement of the fire brigade, specialist contractors, environmental staff from the council, the Garda and the Customs and Excise.  The end result is clean-up costs amounting to over &euro;1.5 million.</P>
        <P>If this amount of fuel is being washed it is obvious that a considerable amount of illegal fuel is entering the market.  The haulage industry has been severely affected as a result of these high levels of fuel laundering.  I have met a number of representatives from the haulage industry, both locally and nationally, on this matter.  In February a meeting was arranged with the Minister for Finance, officials from the Department of Finance and representatives from the Irish Road Hauliers Association.  Following the meeting a special working group was established to examine the matter and to find a workable solution to this problem and other issues relating to the haulage industry.  I am a member of the working group, which has met on a number of occasions since our initial meeting in February.  Our meetings have been very useful in terms of permitting frank discussions and an exchange of ideas aimed at finding a workable solution.  I acknowledge the commitment and work of the representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association in this regard.</P>
        <P>While there is no quick fix solution to this problem the will now exists to combat fuel laundering.  This will has been sadly lacking in the past.  In this regard, I welcome the changes introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act, which will provide for more effective controls in the fuel market.  Under the new arrangements persons dealing in marked fuel will be required to hold a licence.  The granting of this licence will be subject to tax clearance requirements and Revenue will have the power to revoke a licence if any condition is breached.  The requirements for record keeping will also be strengthened and traders will have to make regular returns detailing their fuel transactions.  The penalties for those found to be involved in fuel laundering have also significantly increased.</P>
        <P>Revenue is in talks with the UK authorities regarding the marking of diesel and is looking to go to market shortly to seek a new marker.  The big issue with regard to enforcement in fuel smuggling is traceability and it is clear that steps need to be taken to ensure greater traceability in the fuel market.  The introduction of a new marker would be a welcome start in this regard.</P>
        <P>These positive steps have been taken by the Government since it entered office in order to curtail the level of abuse that is ongoing in the Irish fuel market.  It is not right that legitimate, law abiding fuel retailers are struggling due to the fact that those engaging in illegal activity have an unfair advantage and I strongly support any measure that will provide Revenue with sharper teeth in policing this area.  At the end of the day, a legitimate fuel market will ultimately lead to a fair price for both the retailer and the consumer.</P>
        <P>It goes without saying that we would all prefer for the price of fuel to be cheaper but if the Government were to reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel by 4 cent per litre, as this Bill proposes, where does Fianna F&aacute;il expect that shortfall in revenue to be recovered?  The Minister stated earlier that Fianna F&aacute;il is living in an economic dreamland with regard to its proposal.  It is about time it woke up.  The reality of the situation is that the Government is working within extremely difficult financial constraints as a result of the irresponsible budgetary measures introduced while Fianna F&aacute;il was in power.  Unfortunately it appears that the party has not learnt from the mistakes of the past.  I will not be supporting this Bill.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The enormous increase in the cost of fuel in recent years has put considerable pressure on businesses, households and older people.  Under the last Government excise duty, carbon tax and VAT increases amounted to 16 cent per litre of petrol and almost 12 cent per litre of diesel.  This Government has raised the price of petrol and diesel by approximately 1.5 cent per litre.</P>
        <P>The notion that our policies are to blame for the rising cost of fuel is not founded in reality.  The &euro;5 per tonne increase in the carbon tax announced in the last budget was the result of a previous agreement with the troika which was required because of the reckless behaviour of Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  It is difficult to describe the cheek of that party in introducing this Bill after what it has done to the country.  If there was a Nobel prize for brass necks, Deputy Dooley would win it.  I have no doubt John Drennan will have no difficulty in finding the biggest brass neck in this House.  That is the reality.  On the 2% increase in VAT&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>So much so that I read through some of the old files in my office to find a quote that would suit tonight&rsquo;s topic perfectly as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Given the current Exchequer deficit position, the decision to increase the standard VAT rate continues to be necessary to support the public finances.  We are borrowing to fund day-to-day public services, which is unsustainable as future generations will be required to pay higher taxes unless we correct the public finances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a quote from the late Brian Lenihan Jr., the former Minister for Finance on 13 May 2009.  I only wish some of his colleagues would take note of this more often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We explained how it could be done that way.  The Deputy should have come in earlier and he would have heard how it could be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course I understand the difficulty many people have in coping with the high costs.  The reality is that most of these increases have come as a result of changing oil prices on the international market, exchange rates as well as production and refining costs.  Compared with our closest neighbour, the UK, the excise rate on petrol and diesel is at a relatively low level.  Our rates on petrol are nearly 20% lower and our rates on diesel are 35% lower than they are in the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has one minute left.</P>

	<P>I have much more to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not hold the presses for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We rank tenth in the EU when it comes to petrol prices with countries such as Netherlands, Italy, Germany and France ranked above us with higher fuel costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should keep it for the branch meeting in Fethard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is an international one.  However, the important issue that remains to be tackled is the issue of fuel laundering.  Across the country several people have raised that issue and it has not been addressed.  Deputy Heather Humphreys already dealt with it in detail.  Members of this House should collectively stand up man for man and call for this laundering to be stopped because it is robbing everybody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When I introduce the Bill, I will expect the Deputy to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the issue we need to address and stop the nonsense of bringing in a Bill that cannot be passed by the House while trying to bluff the people.  The reality is that laundering is what needs to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not laundering petrol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on tonight&rsquo;s motion.  The cost of fuel and the corresponding arguments in respect of excise duty are issues which matter to most households around the country now more than ever, given the changed social landscape of reduced household budgets and the increased awareness of discretionary spending.  We cannot fudge the forecourt issue any longer.  We must have a real and robust debate on the matter and examine ways in which penal rates being imposed on motorists can be addressed in a manner that is responsible and responsive to consumer sentiment.  In this context, I welcome Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s initiative on bringing this matter before the House this evening.</P>
        <P>Recent motorist surveys have demonstrated how the cost of fuel in Ireland continues to become more expensive.  Just this month the AA estimated that the average motorist spends &euro;249 a month on petrol, which equates to just under &euro;3,000 per annum.  According to the organisation, in January 2009 people were paying 95 cent a litre for petrol.  Last month, that had crept up to an average of &euro;1.62.  This means that somebody, who was paying &euro;142 a month for petrol in January 2009, is now paying &euro;300.</P>
        <P>I agree with the opposing party&rsquo;s view that such punitive costs are counterproductive because they mean less money in people&rsquo;s pockets and therefore less money circulating in a local economy.  At its most basic level, higher fuel costs reduce people&rsquo;s spending power, thereby dissuading them from making discretionary journeys and forcing them to cancel spending in their local area.  In short, the higher costs effectively negate the effect of extra revenue brought into the Exchequer by increased excise duty.</P>
        <P>Most affected are parents who drive their children to school, people who use their cars regularly, and those who are trapped in the perfect commuter storm &mdash; caught between struggling to make mortgage repayments and pay for petrol to run their commuting lifestyles.  This week <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that one commuting couple are spending the equivalent of four mortgage repayments a year on fuel alone.</P>
        <P>The business and SME community are also suffering.  Truckers, hauliers, fishermen and plant hire businesses are just some of the fuel-dependent industries here being disproportionately affected by higher fuel costs, which experts say are having a major impact on operating costs for firms of all sizes.  Many Members of this House from all sides can attest to that.  A recent survey by Close Business Barometer showed that 46% of Irish firms cited fuel costs as one of their main daily concerns.  Some 26% of businesses are being forced to pass some of these costs on to the customer, further hitting the pockets of already cash-strapped households.</P>
        <P>With respect, however, this was an issue against which Fianna F&aacute;il repeatedly turned its face while in power.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has already pointed out, the same party made an agreement in Europe a few years ago not to react to spikes in the price of diesel and petrol by making distortionary fiscal adjustments, instead agreeing that prices would be allowed to come down again in a co-ordinated fashion over the course of the cycle.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy Timmy Dooley, who moved this Bill, on his new-found concern for hard-pressed households.  I draw his attention to a Labour Private Members&rsquo; motion debated in this House on 12 October 2010 against which he voted, and which dealt with the effect of electricity prices increases and fuel poverty on households on low incomes.  His sudden interest in the financial hardship of these families is belated and indeed amusing.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, Fianna F&aacute;il has acknowledged that the tax adjustment would give rise to an initial marginal net cost to the Exchequer, creating an effective hole of &euro;145 million.  While I broadly agree that adjusting fuel prices would in time be beneficial because it would encourage consumers to spend money in other sectors of the economy, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s has failed to come up with any revenue-raising alternative.  What does it propose replace that &euro;145 million if the Bill were accepted?</P>
        <P>As Deputy Tom Hayes has pointed out, much of problem relates to international factors, including the crude oil issue, the war in Libya &mdash; some Members of this House could give us some intimate detail of what went on there &mdash; and Western tensions with Iran.  We must understand and acknowledge that many of the issues affecting this topic are not domestic but international.  In that context and in the absence of any alternative proposal it is very difficult to expect other Members of this House to support Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Bill.  I broadly support the thrust of the Bill and it is important for us to recognise when the Opposition comes up with a proposal.  Regardless of how nuanced it might be, it deserves to be mentioned.</P>
        <P>Deputy Heather Humphreys, who knows more about this issue than the rest of us, has pointed to the criminality in Border areas.  The thugs and mindless criminals, who launder fuel, take the money out of the ordinary law-abiding forecourt owner.  Such criminal activity is having a major effect on legitimate tax-compliant business in the Border areas.  Just as the international dimension affects this issue here, we must recognise that criminality in Border areas is placing hardship in disproportionate terms on other people who are law-abiding and respectful citizens of our Republic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>Probably one of the only ways to get rid of criminality in Border regions is to get rid of the Border.  I would welcome the support of all parties in helping us in achieving that.  It is extremely important if we want to sort out cross-Border fuel issues that we work for all-island excise and tax rates.  The Government will not find us wanting with regard to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We could begin with all-Ireland law and order with no criminals North or South.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Across the State people are hurting as a result of four years of austerity.  Families and businesses are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet.  Every day we hear stories of people being forced to make impossible decisions with the meagre money they have.  Unemployment, emigration, mortgage distress, financial hardship, etc., have been forced on the people through austerity cuts.  These policies were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and are now being continued under the Fine Gael and Labour Party Administration.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always been against this consensus for cuts.  When Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the austerity budgets in 2009&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>

	<P>Paisley&rsquo;s austerity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>When Fianna F&aacute;il was introducing austerity budgets in 2009 and 2010, Sinn F&eacute;in opposed them because of the damage they would do to the economy.  When Fine Gael and the Labour Party followed in Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s footsteps in December, we opposed that too.  On every occasion we provided detailed costings of alternatives to promote growth, jobs and equality.  I listened to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Deputy Dooley on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week outlining his party&rsquo;s commitment to what he called constructive opposition.  He told listeners that Fianna F&aacute;il was not interested in populist opposition, or opposition for its own sake, and that it had tabled 20 Bills since the last general election.  Many Members would be rightly sceptical, like me, and wonder why Fianna F&aacute;il did not introduce these Bills when it was in government.</P>
        <P>The Bill we are discussing tonight is a case in point.  Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports any measure that will reduce pressure on struggling families and businesses.  The proposal to reduce the cost of petrol and diesel by four cent per litre, if passed, would significantly ease the burden on tens of thousands of people.  Sinn F&eacute;in would support such a Bill.  However, it is important to remind ourselves who is responsible for creating this taxation burden in the first place.  In last December&rsquo;s budget, the Labour Party and Fine Gael introduced an increase of 1 cent per litre of fuel, but over the three years before that, Fianna F&aacute;il had introduced a massive increase of 14 cent per litre of petrol or diesel.  Nobody should be under any illusion that if Fianna F&aacute;il had been in government last December, it would have increased the fuel excise once again, and Deputy Dooley would have voted for it, just as he did from 2009 to 2011.  This Bill, rather than being an exercise in constructive opposition, is a return to classic Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us not forget the reason people are so heavily dependent on their cars, particularly in rural Ireland.  It is because of the lack of investment in the transportation system by Fianna F&aacute;il between 1997 and 2011.  In addition, Fianna F&aacute;il has not clarified where it will source the replacement revenue.  A sum of &euro;140 million is not insignificant, especially in the current financial climate.  Those who propose tax reductions should have the responsibility of explaining where the replacement revenue will come from.  This is what Sinn F&eacute;in has done in its pre-budget submission.  Claims that a reduction in petrol and diesel tax would be revenue-neutral are hocus pocus.  Fianna F&aacute;il needs to tell us where it is going to collect these taxes and, in particular, how it is going to replace the &euro;140 million.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Government take a strategic view on the pricing of fuel, which is a pivotal issue across the State.  This includes the issues of a VAT rebate, the identification of correct prices for fuel and the use of the taxation system to ensure there is no radical change in price.  It can be done.  It is also important to build into this thought process consideration of our environmental obligations and our obligations with regard to the 2020 targets set by Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Rising fuel prices are a significant factor in the current deep recession in the Irish economy.  They are pushing up the prices of goods and services and decreasing demand and spending.  Producers, service providers and retailers are being hit hard.  Consumers also know the cost, as does everyone dependent on transport to get to work.  The overall effect on the economy is stagnation and decline, with a resulting fall in tax revenue.</P>
        <P>For the hauliers on whom we depend totally for our imports and exports, the problem has become acute.  The Irish Road Haulage Association has said that so-called tanker tourism is now widespread, with trucks leaving Ireland with the minimum of fuel in the tank and filling up abroad.  This entails a major loss of revenue for the State.  For motorists the situation is equally serious.  Household budgets have been hit with blow after blow by this and the previous Government.  New flat-rate taxes and stealth charges are piling huge pressure on low- to middle-income families.  Add to this the rising price of fuel, and there is real hardship.  This is especially the case for those who are totally dependent on their cars for work, study or access to services.  Outside our cities, the public transport network in this State is nothing less than appalling.  In nearly 14 years in Government, Fianna F&aacute;il failed to develop a proper public transport network for rural Ireland, failing even to reopen existing railway lines as promised, and left us with a bus network little better than when they came to office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to figures published by the Automobile Association last week, the State-wide average price of a litre of unleaded petrol is now 164.9 cent &mdash; I would drive anywhere to find that price, if I could &mdash; which is an increase of 2.8 cent compared to the figure for March.  Diesel also rose by 2.2 cent to its new record high of 159.9 cent per litre.  These are average figures across the State.  I have had to pay up to 5 cent more than that average figure for a litre of unleaded petrol in recent days &mdash; that is, 169.9 cent.  It is scandalous.  The average motorist now pays an estimated &euro;226 for fuel in a month, of which &euro;127.77, or 57%, is tax.  That figure is &euro;30 higher than it was just last October.  According to the Minister for Finance in reply to a question I asked last week in the D&aacute;il, 32.3% of the price of petrol and 26.5% of the price of diesel is excise duty.  These price rises fall most heavily on those who depend on their cars to commute to work or must use vehicles as an integral part of their businesses.  It is undoubtedly a key factor in closing many businesses.  The figures I have cited reflect the severe difficulties caused to hauliers &mdash; I would particularly like to reflect on them &mdash; and to the wider economy by rising fuel costs.  This needs to be tackled by the Government.</P>
        <P>Everything should be put on the table, including prices at the pumps and the level of excise duty.  I emphasise, as I have done here before, the urgent requirement &mdash; I say this with all the strength I can command &mdash; to tackle the reprehensible diesel laundering racket, which I absolutely reject.  Despite an earlier speaker&rsquo;s commentary, this is not confined to one area of the country; the beneficiaries could very well be anywhere from Donegal to Cork, and all places in between, and people need to wake up to that fact.  These people need to be rooted out and this outrageous activity finished once and for all.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleagues in Government to go further than this Bill provides.  The Bill does not go far enough, especially for diesel.  Road hauliers are being severely hit, jobs are being lost, and worse will follow.  Ultimately, we are all paying and will continue to pay the price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the broad intent of the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, but it does not go nearly far enough.  A reduction of four or five cent per litre, while welcome, is not enough to get this country moving again.  Let us think for a moment about the agri-food sector.  Everybody talks about how well the sector is doing, which is true.  However, the industry is under significant threat from rising fuel prices.  Fuel costs for farmers have doubled in the last three years, but profits have not increased to match.  The profit margins of individual farmers are being eroded, which is resulting in serious financial pressure, particularly for the smaller farmers of the west and north west.  Costs for agricultural contractors are astronomical during the summer and harvest periods, and these are passed on to farmers.  In the last two years, the price of agricultural diesel has risen by a massive 54%.  Imagine the effect on any industry in which the cost of a major component rises by 54% in two years.  The price of road diesel has increased by almost 35%.  At a time when the Government, rightly, calls for industrial and commercial competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in agriculture is being damaged due to expensive road haulage costs and the distance we are from the markets.  I call on the Government to substantially reduce fuel duties and stop the prices of petrol and diesel from spiralling.  The high price of fuel is causing severe hardship to consumers.  Government taxes account for more than 57% of the cost of fuel, according to the Irish Petrol Retail Association.  An earlier speaker mentioned Libya and the oil producers but Government is the main taker from the price of fuel.  It is within the remit of the Government to address the considerable extra hardship placed on rural dwellers by these taxes.</P>
        <P>Motoring is not an optional extra in the constituency I represent, Sligo-Leitrim.  We do not have buses passing our door every 15 minutes and do not have access to taxis or the Luas in order to bring our children to school, go shopping, go to work or visit the doctor.  The Government should also seriously consider the law of diminishing returns.  Energy and transport costs are seriously damaging our local and national competitiveness.  A recent survey by the Automobile Association found that fuel prices have become so grave for some people that livelihoods are now at stake.  The survey shows costs of &euro;100 per week for the average car owner.  I recall the remark by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to the effect that the household tax costs only &euro;2 a week extra.  He was not talking about the existing cost of &euro;100 per week that any family unfortunate enough to own a car in these times must pay.  Five per cent of the motorists polled in that AA survey indicated they will either definitely or possibly abandon their job this year as their daily commute has become too expensive.  Another 8% stated their fuel bill has become such a burden they are currently likely to be on the look out for alternative employment in the near future if such exists closer to their home.</P>
        <P>Biofuels must also be considered as a means of providing an alternative fuel supply in this time of international uncertainty.  There has to be investment in the growing of crops for biofuels, such as rapeseed, willow and sugar beet.  We cannot become solely dependent on imported biofuels as we have become so on fossil fuels.  A clean and affordable alternative must be found.</P>
        <P>It is a pity this motion was not broadened to include heating oil because many families whose houses were designed for oil-fired central heating simply cannot afford the exorbitant costs involved in fuel purchase.  We should seriously consider extending the SEI warmer home scheme to provide support for families who wish to install solid fuel alongside their existing oil-fired systems.</P>

	<P>I, too, am delighted to speak on this motion, in the limited time available to me.  I am really disappointed in the response from the Government.  I quote from a speech the Taoiseach made some years ago.  He stated: &ldquo;I am disappointed that Deputy Cowen does not have an initiative with regard to the mix of excise duties and VAT to ensure they are not used as a further battering ram against the hard-pressed consumer&rdquo;.  What kind of optics, politics or blackguarding is this?  The public are sick of all of us.  The price of oil is downright disgraceful.  I have a meeting tomorrow, as I am sure many of us have, with the Irish Agricultural Contractors Association, a new association set up to try to save whatever bastion its members have left.  They have no bank overdrafts.  I met 131 of them two weeks ago, 130 of whom had their overdrafts taken away.  There is talk of being pro-jobs and pro-business.  The Government does not have a clue.  The mandarins in the Department are running the show and they cannot see beyond their noses.  They need to take off their glasses and clean them because they are codding the people.  People cannot afford to drive their cars.  The law of diminishing returns is a fact.</P>

	<P>I did, but now I am talking about the Minister of State and his party.  When they were over here they knew everything.  I have an e-mail from a person in South Tipperary, a haulier, who states, &ldquo;We are currently purchasing 33,000 litres of diesel in Belgium and 19,000 in Luxembourg per month&rdquo;.  Imagine that.  Why?  The reason is the following difference in prices: 7 cent difference between our price and that in Belgium and 12 cent between our price and that in Luxembourg.  Who are we codding?  The hauliers who can afford to go abroad are lucky.  The people at home cannot go.  They are being extinguished from business and the lifeblood is being driven out of them.  If the Government increases VAT we will then face another increase on 1 May, of 1.6% in carbon tax.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak about this new piece of legislation, the Motorists Emergency Relief Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  As many of my colleagues have also observed, I wish it would go further.  It is an attempt to help the hard-pressed motorist while at the same time trying to generate activity in the economy and increase employment.  It would also act as a job-saving measure which is something on which this Government should focus.</P>
        <P>Each day, I meet motorists and small business people who have to cope with the high price of diesel and petrol.  They are fighting for their lives and their businesses and are trying to survive for their families.  This is the real economic world and I wish the Government would open its eyes and listen to the people who want a hand-up, not a hand-out.  It is a little rich for this Government to lecture the people on a regular basis about competitiveness and costs while at the same time it runs away from the proposals in this legislation.  When one looks at its details, one sees it is an Act that would allow for the quarterly review of excise duty on petrol and diesel and the introduction of an immediate reduction of 4% per litre on the excise duty on both fuels.  The Minister for Finance would review the excise duty on mineral oil on a quarterly basis, taking into account the international price of oil, the domestic economy, the public finances and the annual rate of inflation as per consumer price index.  In addition, the legislation states, in subsection (3): &ldquo;the reduction in excise duty shall come into effect on the enactment of this Bill and shall not give rise to any refund of excise duty&rdquo;.  Let us have some common sense in this debate and let us deal with the high cost issues in this Bill.  It is time for the Government to get off the fence, do something practical and generate movement and spending in the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While we are on this issue,  let us look at the United States and the madness of boycotting bargain oil coming from countries such as Iran.  Recently, I met the Iranian ambassador who told me straight out that, first, Iran does not want any nuclear weapons as they are against the people&rsquo;s faith and religion and second, Iran wants to do business with Ireland, increase imports and trade with us.  What is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, doing?  He is closing down our embassy in Tehran.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 121, 132 and 140 together.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, I announced on 4 April 2012 that the Government has decided to hold a competition for the next National Lottery licence and that the licence will be for a 20 year period.</P>
        <P>The new licence will involve an upfront payment to the State, with some of the payment being used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies will appreciate that in advance of the competition, it is not possible to say how much the upfront payment will be or indeed how much of it will be allocated to help fund the building of the proposed new Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>The ongoing provision of a fixed percentage of annual lottery turnover for good causes will be a condition of the licence.  The Government has decided that this percentage is to be retained at 30.5% which was the level that was achieved in 2011.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the indicative timetable for the award of the licence, an Invitation for Expressions of Interest in Applying for the National Lottery Licence would be published in August and an Invitation to Apply for the Licence would be published in October.  I would like to assure the Deputies that the terms of the competition will be framed in such a way as to ensure that the National Lottery will continue the high standards that it has maintained since its establishment in the mid-1980s.</P>
        <P>In relation to retail outlets authorised to sell National Lottery tickets, I am cognisant of the essential role which retailers play in the operation of the Lottery.  I am also aware of the importance to retailers of income from the Lottery, particularly in the present economic climate.  I can assure the Deputies that the position of retailers will be taken into consideration in the context of the arrangements for the next Lottery licence.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the Institute of Public Administrations finding in its research paper Public Sector Trends 2011 that remuneration for senior management in the public sector is 7.7 times the remuneration of secretaries in comparison to Nordic countries where the remuneration for senior managers is 3.5 times the remuneration of secretaries; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>While comparisons of public servants&rsquo; pay rates across different countries are difficult to achieve on a &ldquo;like for like&rdquo; basis, the best available figures are those published by the OECD as part of its &ldquo;Government at a Glance 2010&rdquo; report.  I understand it is this data which the Public Sector Trends 2011 research paper draws upon for its conclusions in relation to international pay comparisons. </P>
        <P>The statistics on which the OECD based its report predate the pay reductions applied on a progressive basis to all public servants, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2010.  The pay reductions applied to higher paid public servants under that legislation were based on the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, which conducted a cross-country comparative exercise on pay rates for certain senior grades.  On foot of that, the then Government cut the pay of the highest paid public servants by between 8% and 20%.  In contrast, reductions in pay that applied to lower paid staff would have ranged between 5% and 5.5% approximately.  It is important to note that the OECD data does not show Irish public service pay rates to be significantly out of line with other OECD countries across a broad range of disciplines on a purchasing power parity basis even though the data predates the implementation of the pay cuts.</P>
        <P>The current Government, based on proposals put forward by me in June 2011, imposed further significant reductions in higher level pay in the public service.  By way of illustration, taking account of the pension related deduction and the pay reductions applied cumulatively to the gross salaries of the comparative grades of Secretary General and Clerical Officer between March 09 and June 2011, the reductions effected amount to 32% at Secretary General II (40% at Secretary General I) Level but at clerical officer the level of reduction amounts to less than 9%.  This excludes the impact of additional tax increases that apply to all workers in the economy which are also progressive.</P>
        <P>I believe the Government has demonstrated a significant track record since coming to office of addressing higher remuneration rates in the public service including by way of referendum and will continue to ensure that the burden of fiscal adjustment, including the adjustment required in the pay bill, will be shared fairly across all income levels.</P>

	<P>The table below sets out the difference between the net current and capital expenditure positions extracted from the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014, published on 5 December 2011 and the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012, published on 23 February 2012.  The overall change is a reduction of &euro;1.38 million or 0.003%.    </P>
        <P>The individual changes to Departmental allocations can be summarised as technical adjustments arising from transfer of functions between Vote Groups and the distribution of &euro;20 million from the unallocated contingency fund for EU Presidency set-up costs.</P>

	<P>Shared services is a core element of the Public Service Reform agenda which is being driven by my Department.  Given the scale of the reform challenge facing us and the increasing demand for Public Services, it is vital that we begin to deliver back-office business processes at a higher service quality. </P>
        <P>The Public Service Reform Plan published in November 2011 sets out aggressive timelines for the delivery of shared services across the Public Service.  Together with my colleagues in Government, I am committed to the delivery of this significant transformation initiative in a planned way and on the basis of international best practice.  This is the only way that meaningful, medium-term savings can be achieved.  A National Shared Services Office, led by a Shared Service Transformation Manager with a strong track record in delivering on these types of projects at a global level, has now been established within my Department.</P>
        <P>Significant work has been undertaken over recent months to prepare the business case for human resources shared services and it is expected to be presented to Government shortly.  Expressions of interest have been sought for the post of Civil Service payroll shared services project manager and the Shared Services Office are also commencing a data gathering exercise to better understand our current payroll arrangements and how they compare with other public and private sector organisations who utilise shared service centres.  Rigorous and detailed design leads to good solutions so the &lsquo;preparation work&rsquo; is essential to ensure that the shared services operations will deliver services at high standards, that business as usual is not jeopardised and that benefits are delivered.  The Shared Services Office is also working with nominated senior officials to ensure that similarly ambitious and robust plans are developed and implemented in the other key sectors of Health, Education, Justice, Defence and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the progress we are making in this area.  We are building the appropriate expertise and engaging with each of the key Departments in a structured way and on the basis of a strong plan, evidence based business cases and ambitious timelines.  The international evidence shows that this is the best way to proceed if you want to realise the maximum benefits over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works undertakes a number of flood relief initiatives in any year under programmes, which, in some cases, are delivered directly through its own resources and in other cases are delivered in conjunction with other agencies such as local authorities.  The principal programmes are: </P>
        <P LI="1">1. Major Capital Works Schemes;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Minor Coastal and Non-Coastal Schemes;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies;</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Arterial Drainage Maintenance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The total allocation included in the OPW&rsquo;s Vote in 2012 for the above flood relief programmes is &euro;60.78m.</P>
        <P>Under its Major Capital Works Programme, the OPW currently has nine major flood relief schemes at construction stage.  It is expected that another six schemes will commence construction before the end of 2012, subject to completion of procurement and other preparatory formalities and availability of funding.  There are also a further 11 schemes at various stages of design and planning.  Approximately &euro;29 million is expected to be expended on all of these schemes during the course of the year.</P>
        <P>Under the Minor Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, the OPW provides funding to local authorities for smaller scale, more localised mitigation measures they wish to undertake in their areas.  It is open to any local authority to submit an application to the OPW for funding under the scheme.  The standard application forms, guidelines and eligibility criteria, are available on the OPW website.  Each application will be assessed in accordance with the criteria now in place and having regard to the overall availability of financial resources for such works in 2012.  To date this year, funding of almost &euro;1.5m has been approved under the Scheme for 13 local authorities in respect of 36 projects.  Total funding of &euro;21.4m was approved in 2010 and 2011 combined, for 32 local authorities in respect of 265 projects.</P>
        <P>The relevant local authority is responsible for the procurement, planning, detailed financial management and day-to-day implementation of all aspects of the projects approved under the Scheme.  Local authorities are continuing to undertake a number of the projects approved in 2010 and 2011 and are expected to commence further projects in 2012.</P>
        <P>In addition to the specific flood relief works, the OPW will continue in 2012 with a major national initiative to systematically identify, assess, document and report on the most significant flood risks throughout the country.  This work is being undertaken on the OPW&rsquo;s behalf by specialist consultants and is organised into six separate regional or catchment areas.  These assessments, which are known as CFRAM studies, will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas where there is significant risk in each major catchment in the country.</P>
        <P>Under the arterial drainage maintenance programme, the OPW will continue in 2012 to undertake ongoing maintenance of completed arterial drainage and flood relief schemes.</P>

	<P>The Employment Control Framework (ECF) for 2012 set a ceiling of 294,400 on public service staffing numbers by the end of this year.  This will allow scope for some targeted recruitment of up to 3,000 in 2012 so as to address needs in key areas of front-line services, particularly in the Health and Education Sectors and other strategic requirements including the EU presidency in 2013.  </P>
        <P>The data sought by the Deputy on requests for moratorium exceptions for 2012 is being compiled and will be forwarded to her shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming Presidency of the EU in the first 6 months of 2013, the Government has provided up to &euro;10 million this year for additional staffing costs in the lead-up period.  Departments can meet their temporary additional Presidency staffing needs in a number of ways including the temporary taking on of extra personnel (e.g. via redeployment/secondment, interns, hiring of specialist skills) on appropriate terms and conditions.  No permanent hiring of new staff is envisaged for the EU presidency.</P>

        <P>I am happy to report to the House that significant progress has been made on advancing the asset disposal programme that I announced last February.  A number of inter-departmental working groups have been established to examine each of the assets referred to in my announcement and NewERA has prepared two very thorough financial reports on BGE and Coillte which have now been considered by their respective working groups.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed under the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme to outlining in detail for the troika, by the end of the second quarter (end June 2012), the specific regulatory, legislative, corporate governance and financial reforms which need to be taken in 2012, ensuring consistency with relevant EU legislation where necessary, to allow for the asset sale programme to proceed in 2013, and a calendar with indicative timelines for sales will be set out.  The issues requiring resolution having already been identified by the end of the first quarter, work is continuing now in the relevant Departments and agencies on considering how they should be addressed in order to facilitate the launch of sale transactions in 2013.</P>

	<P>A three month notice period was introduced as a temporary measure to assist management across the public service in dealing with the large number of retirements of staff in the run up to the end of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; &mdash; i.e. the period during which the calculation of pension was unaffected by the pay reductions applied under the <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</i></P>
        <P>In order to protect public services it was critical that management in each of the sectors had knowledge of the numbers of staff retiring and the business areas that might be affected by potentially large scale departures.</P>
        <P>While the specific circumstances of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; resulted in a higher number of retirements than would normally occur, it remains critical that management know when key staff will be leaving their organisation.</P>
        <P>In addition, we are required under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF to make quarterly returns on the progress being made in relation to reductions in numbers in the public service.  Accurate and early information on forthcoming retirements is an important input and it provides us with information on whether the reduction in the public service pay bill arising from impending retirements is sufficient to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>
        <P>In light of this it is my intention to issue a revised instruction in relation to notice requirements for retirements and resignations in the civil service shortly.  Discussions have commenced with the civil service unions on the introduction of a formalised required notice period.  The question of senior civil servants and key personnel giving longer notice is also being examined.</P>

        <P>My Secretary General wrote to all Secretaries General on March 27th, asking that they put appropriate processes in place to ensure that this ambitious target is met.</P>
        <P>The Reform and Delivery Office was established in my Department to oversee and drive the Public Service Reform programme.  While reform cannot be micro-managed from the Centre, the Office, through its governance structures, monitors the implementation of the Public Service Reform Plan, as well as organisational and sectoral reforms set out in the Integrated Reform Delivery Plans of Departments and major Offices.  As part of this process, the Reform and Delivery Office receives progress updates on a regular basis and reports on this progress to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform, which meets on a quarterly basis.  Where it is felt that sufficient progress is not being made in a particular area, action will be taken to assess the situation and to provide impetus and support for implementation, if required.</P>

	<P>As I previously advised the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question number 81 on 28 February (ref. 11208/12), Secretaries General appointed under the TLAC process have exit arrangements which are part of their terms of employment following a Government decision at the time of appointment.</P>
        <P>The Government revised the arrangements in October 2011 to apply to Secretaries General newly appointed thereafter.  Under the revised terms, newly appointed Secretaries General will no longer benefit from immediate payment of pension and lump sum at the end of their term (unless they have already reached pension age); nor will they benefit from notional added years for pension purposes.  These are significant changes to the terms which applied to previous appointees, which included the offer of an alternative post in the Public Service or a severance payment and immediate retirement on an enhanced pension.</P>
        <P>The previous terms still apply to currently serving Secretaries General who were appointed under those terms, as the terms form part of their terms of employment.  As I said in my previous reply, the advice of the Office of the Attorney General is that the Government does not have discretion to change those terms.</P>
        <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that a number of pension-related measures have been implemented in the Public Service which affect Secretaries General.  The pay reductions introduced since 2010 will impact on the pension benefits of those retiring after 1 March 2012 onwards.  The pensions of those who retired before that date were subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) introduced in January 2011.  I also recently provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR applicable to pensions over &euro;100,000 from 12% to 20% which will affect Secretaries General on pension above that level.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill to provide for a Single Public Service Pension Scheme is currently before the Oireachtas and will be implemented this year.  It will introduce a pension based on career average earnings, rather than the current system of pension based on final salary, for those who will be members of the scheme.</P>

Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election, or a subsequent by-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.  The conditions governing calculation of and entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent by-election was elected as a member other than as a member of a qualifying party.  Such qualifying Independent TDs are entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152.  A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment of &euro;23,383 for Independent Senators.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to reviewing the Allowance.  Any change proposed following that review will require primary legislation to be prepared.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the Electoral Acts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Under the Electoral Acts, provision is made for two payments to be made to qualifying political parties.  Section 50(c)(ii)(I)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, provides for an annual sum of &euro;4.948 million to be shared among qualified political parties.  Payments are calculated on the basis of the share of first preference votes obtained by an individual qualified party at the previous general election.  Section 50(c)(i)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, also provides for an annual payment in each period of 12 months to each qualified party of &euro;126,973.81.</P>
        <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas provides for a number of changes to the Electoral Acts,  including provision for decreases, as well as increases, in civil service pay to be applied in future to the fund disbursed annually to qualified political parties under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 5 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011, enacted in July 2011, provided for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a qualifying candidate at a Presidential election from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>Oireachtas Members can avail of the Parliamentary Standard Allowance, provided for under section 3 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 2009 which has two elements: a Travel and accommodation allowance and Public Representation Allowance.</P>
        <P>From 1 February 2012, occasional additional secretarial support as well as public relations, certain information technology and training services was included within the scope of this allowance.  This change was effected by the provisions of Statutory Instrument No. 37 of 2012.  The expenditure limits for this allowance remains unchanged.</P>
        <P>In addition Statutory Instrument No. 328 of 2011 reduced the number of pre-paid envelopes available to members as follows from 1 July 2011:</P>
        <P LI="1">Deputies: reduced from 1,500 per month to 1,250 per month;</P>
        <P LI="1">Senators: reduced from 1,000 per month to   750 per month.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The estimated savings of this change was &euro;0.152m in 2011 and &euro;0.36m in a full year.</P>
        <P>Finally, additional supports to the activities of members of each House, including secretarial assistance, are provided directly to members of each House under the auspices of the Oireachtas Commission.  Since 2004, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has been financed from the Central Fund.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act is amended every three years to provide for Oireachtas funding allocation for the following three years.  The legislation is also amended as necessary to update finance, staffing, and governance procedures.  It is envisaged that amending legislation will be enacted before the end of 2012.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Public infrastructure is funded primarily in two ways at the moment: Exchequer financing (the vast bulk of funding) and PPP-sourced funding for particular projects that are suited to the PPP approach while providing value for money for the State.  The Exchequer capital programme for the next five years has been set at &euro;17 billion.  This will represent significant continued Exchequer investment in the maintenance of valuable infrastructure and the creation of new assets &mdash; especially for new schools and healthcare provision.</P>
        <P>I am very keen that we look at how we can use private sector funding to supplement our Exchequer investment.  As the Deputy will be aware, PPPs have been used in Ireland for over a decade, mostly in schools and roads projects &mdash; where they give value for money and are affordable.  The global credit crunch has had a significant impact on the PPP funding market which has, in turn, had significant negative consequences for delivery of PPPs.  My Department is actively exploring the potential to unlock additional monies to supplement bank funding.  A range of potential solutions are being explored including domestic pension funds, the NPRF/SIF and new EU financial instruments.  Direct dialogue with representatives of pension funds has intensified and is looking promising.  Dialogue is now focusing in on how deals could be structured to encourage pension funds to provide debt funding for new infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>My Department is also having useful discussions with the NPRF and the investment managers of the Irish Infrastructure Fund, a sub-fund of the Strategic Investment Fund, about projects they might invest in.  The NPRF has already agreed to fund a water metering programme and may commit further monies for investment in Irish PPPs.  My Department is working with the Funds to identify potential projects that could be supported should a source of funding become available.</P>
        <P>My Department is also examining, in conjunction with other Departments, how new Financial Instruments and other EU support mechanisms could help us to access private funding.  We are actively engaging with European Institutions to see what assistance might be available to us including co-financing for PPP projects and loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) for Exchequer funded projects; such funding would not be additional to that envisaged in the Medium Term Investment Framework but would provide funding on more favourable terms than are otherwise available to the State. </P>

	<P>The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of unemployment in the State.  Due to methodology and sample size it is not possible to produce reliable county level estimates from the QNHS.  The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of persons claiming Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance and Other Registrants as registered with the Department of Social Protection. </P>
        <P FLI="0">The Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  However as it is a register rather than a sample survey County level totals are available from the Live Register.</P>

	<P>The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period offers an unparalleled and unique global opportunity to showcase Ireland and to bring the message that Ireland is open for business to all our key global markets and to Ireland&rsquo;s many friends around the world. The importance of Ministerial visits during this period cannot be underestimated in terms of our economic recovery and delivery of foreign direct investment to Ireland. During my visit to the United States I met with President Obama, Vice President Biden, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and many political leaders. I addressed a number of high profile events including the Ireland Fund dinner in Washington, and including a joint EI/IDA business lunch.</P>
        <P>The costs incurred by my Department to date in respect of the 2012 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day overseas travel programme are detailed in the following table.  The total costs of the visit have not yet been finalised.  Invoices will be submitted in due course through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for reimbursement by my Department, and will include hotel costs; car hire; and other miscellaneous costs.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together.</P>
        <P>The figure for telephones quoted by the Deputy includes expenditure on landline calls, mobile calls and data lines. Data lines are used to connect the three buildings occupied by the Office, and to provide a connection to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and high speed connections to the government network. These connections are duplicated to allow for business to continue in the event of line failure or other loss of connectivity. Of the total of &euro;540,795 quoted, some &euro;168,000 is attributable to data lines over the three years.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;240,000 is attributable to landline use over the three years giving an average spend of &euro;80,000 per year. Based on a staff of approximately 220, this shows an average spend of &euro;364 per staff member per year.</P>
        <P>&euro;132,000 was spent on mobile phones over the three years giving an average spend of &euro;44,000 per year. The average spend per mobile phone user over the three year period was &euro;404 per annum.</P>
        <P>All staff have access to a landline telephone extension from the Office switchboard.</P>
        <P>Senior management and legal staff who attend court or are regularly out of the Office on business have been allocated mobile phones. Some staff are allocated mobile phones on a temporary basis while on call or working on specific cases. As a rule the Office avails of offers of free mobile phones from the contracted supplier. Specific phones have been bought for five Officers within the last two years at a cost of approximately &euro;1,500.</P>
        <P>The Office mobile phone contract has an &lsquo;all in&rsquo; price for calls and text to Irish numbers. The Office has a policy whereby personal usage outside this price is recouped from staff.</P>
        <P>The Office considers that it achieves value for money with its telecommunications services.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> the reason telephonist services are outsourced by the Office of the Chief State&rsquo;s Solicitor. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The telephonist also acts as a receptionist. The Office carries out a significant amount of its business over the telephone and regularly receives legal documents at the front desk. It needs to have its telephonist/receptionist service available over normal business hours including lunchtimes. </P>
        <P>The matter of providing receptionist/telephonist services from within internal resources is considered from time to time, most recently last year. Following review it has become apparent that there would be little or no savings to be made, particularly as staff would have to be taken from core duties of assisting with the legal work of the Office. Given the current financial situation and the moratorium on recruitment and promotions it would not be possible to recruit extra staff to carry out this function.</P>
        <P>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently asked all Departments and Offices to review non-core work with a view to using external services where possible. This example of where the Office has already been outsourcing non-core work has been reported to the Department.</P>

	<P>Over the last three years the Office has refurbished accommodation in its main building, which is occupied by 180 staff. New furniture was provided as part this refurbishment.  The building was last refurbished in 1997 and there has been little change in the layout since.  New furniture to accommodate revised working arrangements has been provided where necessary and to satisfy accessibility and health and safety requirements. The Office has used suppliers based on contracts put in place by the OPW. The Office considers that value for money has been achieved throughout the refurbishment process.  On the basis of 180 staff the average cost per employee over the three year period is &euro;784.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Office reviewed its expenditure in 2011 as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  The main areas of expenditure within the Office are payroll and fees paid to counsel.  Payroll and staff numbers are controlled by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Staff numbers are determined by the Employment Control Framework (ECF) which is revised by the Department from time to time and the allocation for payroll is agreed with that Department as part of the Estimates process. The Office complies with the ECF notified to it and this in turn drives the payroll expenditure. Pay levels are set by the Department.</P>
        <P>The Office has implemented much tighter control of expenditure on fees to Counsel and has achieved a &euro;7.5m reduction in 2011 over the 2008 figure. This represents a 42% reduction in expenditure since 2008. The Office will continue to monitor this expenditure very closely and reduce this cost further if at all possible. However, this very much dependent on the level of legal work coming into the Office from Government Departments and Offices.</P>

<P Just="Left">No payments were made to State Solicitors from the CSSO Vote in 2008.

        <Quest> the items that may be claimed by staff in the Office of the Chief State&rsquo;s Solicitors for travel subsistence and incidental expenses; the average payment to staff members in expenses; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of the Chief State Solicitor adheres to Circular 11/82 in relation to Travel and Subsistence and also to the Circulars in relation to motor travel and subsistence rates issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The main work related expenses for which reimbursement can be sought are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Train fares,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Bus tickets,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Motor mileage,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Accommodation,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Subsistence,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Toll charges,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Car parking.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In general the Office uses the central Government contract for air travel which books trips directly rather than CSSO staff booking flights and recouping the cost from the Office.  All expenses claimed by staff must be vouched for and are paid only if considered essential to the discharge of official duties.  The average amount paid among those staff who claimed travel and subsistence in 2011 was &euro;588.40.</P>

        <Quest> the reason &euro;2.225 million was spent on office machinery by the Office of the Chief State&rsquo;s Solicitor between 2009 and 2011; if he views this figure as excessive; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[19777/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure referred to by the Deputy covers expenditure not just on office machinery but also on IT goods and services as well as on stationery and printer supplies.  The actual amount spent on office machinery over the three years was &euro;162,000, which gives an average spend of &euro;54,000 per year. The figure mainly relates to expenditure on photocopiers and binding equipment: the Office has a significant printing requirement in connection with its legal work.</P>

	<P>The work outsourced by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the category general operative mainly involves the provision of internal and external mail delivery and collection services and the operation of general office machinery such as franking, guillotine and shredding machines.  When plans to move the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to a single site have been implemented, it is anticipated that one of the efficiency savings which will be achieved is that this outsourced service will no longer be required.</P>

	<P>The following lists show the amounts paid by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to Counsel and to State Solicitors in each of the past five years.  There are some differences between the totals of the list of fees to individual barristers shown below and the totals of amounts broken down by Court type supplied in the answer to a question from the Deputy on 27 March.  For 2010 and 2011 the difference is around &euro;20 each year and arises from rounding.</P>
        <P>For 2009 and 2010 the differences are about &euro;1,150 and &euro;1,600 respectively and arose from the fact that the breakdown by Court type was drawn from an older accounting system replaced by the Office in 2009.  For 2007 the difference was some &euro;90,000 and arose from the fact that the old accounting system recorded a small number of payments as having been made in 2006 whereas the funds involved did not actually issue until 2007. All payments were correctly accounted for in the Office&rsquo;s annual Appropriation Accounts.</P>
        <P>During the period in question, payments were made to other solicitors for advice provided to the Office on administrative matters as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office have put arrangements in place to increase the number of Junior and Senior Counsel briefed by the State pursuant to Section 7 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974. These arrangements are designed to ensure an equitable distribution of State work to counsel and to avoid situations where a small number of counsel earn very large sums from the State. The arrangements are being monitored on a monthly basis by the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
        <P>The Offices operate a system of panels based on legal specialism. It is open to any counsel who wishes to do so to apply to be placed on each panel appropriate to their expertise and it is from such panels that nominations of counsel are then made. All members of the appropriate panel can be considered as the work arises. As such, counsel do not apply for any particular brief so it would not be correct to state that counsel applied and were not then selected.</P>

	<P>Human rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Irish Governments and a key plank of our foreign policy.  The Government is concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China.  Last week, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with representatives from the Falun Dafa Association of Ireland and discussed the ways in which human rights issues, including those relating to the Falun Gong, are raised with the Chinese authorities both by Ireland and by the European Union.  Freedom of religious belief and expression is an issue which is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral meetings and at European Union level.  At these meetings, the Government re-iterates the great importance Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</P>
        <P>Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The treatment of Falun Gong is also raised by the European Union as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific Human Rights Dialogue with China.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recently returned from his first official visit to China. During the visit, the Taoiseach and Premier Wen Jiabao released a joint statement establishing a Strategic Partnership for Mutually Beneficial Cooperation between Ireland and China.  This new Strategic Partnership will facilitate practical, effective and result-oriented cooperation so as to further develop the bilateral relationship. It covers several important sectors including education, tourism, agriculture and food as well as science and technology.  The two sides agreed to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges and underlined the leading role of such exchanges for the development of bilateral relations.  The Strategic Partnership, which is a major step forward in bilateral relations, provides for a strengthened political and economic dialogue between China and Ireland and promotes closer consultation and cooperation between my Department and its Chinese counterpart.</P>
        <P>The Strategic Partnership reaffirms the commitment of Ireland and China to respecting and safeguarding human rights.  As indicated in the joint statement, Ireland and China will conduct exchanges of expertise in governance and rule of law on the basis of equality and mutual respect.</P>
        <P>We hope that, as China develops, it will be possible for further progress to be made in ensuring that individual rights are enjoyed by all China&rsquo;s citizens.  We will continue to address these matters in a frequent and regular dialogue, including the EU human rights dialogue and also bilaterally, in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.</P>

	<P>The situation in Mali is of serious concern to Ireland and our European Union partners.  Developments in Mali were discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg yesterday.  The Council agreed strong Conclusions which repeated the EU&rsquo;s condemnation of the seizure of power by force in Mali in March and called for an immediate end to violence, the protection of civilians and the restoration of civil, constitutional government.    The EU stands firmly behind the efforts of the countries of the region to ensure the restoration of constitutional order in Mali.  In this context, we welcome the signing of a Framework Agreement on 6 April for the restoration of constitutional order and urge all involved in Mali to ensure its timely implementation. </P>
        <P>The EU is ready to provide support to the civilian-led transition process in Mali, which must include an electoral process involving all the people of Mali. The EU is monitoring closely progress in the transition process. In the meantime, ongoing direct support to the people of the country will continue, as well as humanitarian aid.</P>
        <P>The UN has also been actively supporting efforts to promote an end to violence and the restoration of constitutional Government in Mali and the position of the UN Security Council was set out in a strong statement issued by the President of the Council on 9 April.</P>
        <P>For our part, through Irish Aid, the Government is exploring with our partners who are active on the ground in the region ways of meeting the current humanitarian needs in Mali.  Earlier this year, the Government announced an allocation of &euro;5 million in support of efforts to address the food crisis in Mali and the wider Sahel region.  Since 2007, Ireland has also provided some &euro;3 million in support of longer-term development programmes and projects managed by civil society organisations working in Mali.</P>

	<P>The Council of the European Union is a key decision-making institution of the EU, at whose meetings all EU Member States are represented.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have represented Ireland frequently at Council meetings.

        <P>On the occasions when I have been unable to attend, Ireland has been represented by a Ministerial colleague, generally the Minister of State for European Affairs.  Since March 2011, Minister of State Creighton has attended 5 Foreign Affairs Councils and 10 General Affairs Councils.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i>, local market teams, led by the Ambassador and including representatives of the relevant State Agencies, have been established in each of Ireland&rsquo;s 27 priority markets. Each team is tasked with preparing an annual local market plan which is reviewed at mid-year and end-year stages.  These plans generally identify areas where a co-ordinated approach to the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests by the Embassy and the relevant State Agencies can produce more effective outcomes.     </P>
        <P>At the second meeting of the Export Trade Council, which I chaired on 16 February 2012, the local market plans for 2012 were discussed.  The mid-year reviews for this year will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the Council.</P>
        <P>Policy on market access issues in the European Union and the World Trade Organisation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>

	<P>Under item 5.9 of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government will &ldquo;utilise the Global Irish Network as official advocates of new and expanded FDI investment in Ireland including introductory meetings, briefings and establishing a restricted website access portal on IDA Ireland website to provide communication and information to relevant Diaspora.&rdquo;   During the Second Global Irish Economic Forum, I announced my intention to establish a Register of Advocates in six specific sectors: Foreign Direct Investment; the financial services sector; the promotion of culture abroad; tourism; assisting Irish exporting companies; and Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation. To date, some 130 members of the Global Irish Network have signed up to be Advocates, 52 of them on the Foreign Direct Investment register. </P>
        <P>The Advocates are tasked with providing advice and assistance to the Government, State Agencies and Irish companies within their geographic areas.  To date, Network members have worked with us on the Invest in Ireland Roundtable with President Clinton, the recent programme of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visits and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to China.</P>
        <P>I understand that the restricted website portal referred to in the Jobs Plan is currently being developed by IDA Ireland and will be live shortly.</P>

The completed application form and supporting documentation is then submitted to the appropriate Embassy of Ireland as specified on the website or directly to the Visa Office at the Department of Justice and Equality in Dublin.   </P>
        <P>In the case of Iranian citizens resident in Iran applying for a holiday visa, a signed application with the supporting documentation should be submitted to the Embassy of Ireland in Ankara, Turkey. In light of restrictions on the sending of Iranian passports outside Iran, it is necessary for applicants whose application is approved by the Department of Justice and Equality to present themselves at the Embassy in Ankara in order for the visa sticker to be attached to their passport.  Alternatively, the Department of Justice and Equality may give advance sanction to the issuing of the visa at another Irish diplomatic or consular mission.</P>

	<P>Ireland has 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices overseas.  In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis. Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing Government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  It will be noted, for example, that missions to international organisations have no direct trade promotional function.  </P>
        <P>The promotion of Irish trade and exports is a key priority for my Department. However, given the multi-faceted nature of the work of staff at Embassies abroad, especially in Missions with small staffing numbers, it is not feasible to provide a breakdown of staff employed to promote trade.</P>
        <P>My Department runs a dedicated intranet site which keeps all missions up to date on economic developments and Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as an investment location, a tourist destination and a trading partner. Training on trade and economic issues is provided for all officers before they travel overseas to ensure our network have the capacity to deal with trade opportunities as they arise.  Other initiatives include regular video conference briefings to the Embassy network from State Agencies on their trading priorities and the recent training provided to 17 Embassy staff and Honorary Consuls as part of the implementation of my Department&rsquo;s Africa Strategy.</P>
        <P>The Embassy network works very closely with the State Agencies which have a remit for the promotion of Irish trade, tourism and inward investment &mdash; Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and IDA Ireland &mdash; and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to find and access new markets.</P>
        <P>Where possible, overseas offices of State Agencies are co-located with Irish Embassies and Consulates on the ground in an &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; arrangement. This increases the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s presence abroad, improves coordination between parties and maximises cost-efficiencies. The arrangement works well in a number of locations, but even where the physical co-location is not practicable, the Embassy network co-ordinates with the State Agencies and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to overcome barriers to exporting and establish themselves in new markets.</P>
        <P>Below is a table listing the administrative costs for operating each of the overseas Missions in 2011.  The figures do not include the salaries of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall salaries budget of the Department rather than on a specific Mission. In addition, the budgets of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid (Vote 29) reflect the additional management and oversight required for the effective implementation of those important programmes:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Uganda is one of the nine priority countries for the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  It is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranked 161 out of 187 in the 2011 United Nations Human Development Index.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has been working in Uganda since 1994 and has made a significant contribution to its development and the fight against poverty and hunger.  Despite economic progress in recent years, Uganda remains an extremely poor country struggling with chronic poverty.</P>
        <P>Our programme of assistance targets priority areas such as the provision of health services for people living with HIV and AIDS, measures to improve access to education, and the strengthening of governance and justice systems for the people of Uganda.  It also addresses hunger and vulnerability in Karamoja, the most disadvantaged region of Uganda and a priority area for our bilateral support.</P>
        <P>In addition to funds provided through our bilateral programme in Uganda, Irish Aid support is also channelled through Irish NGOs and missionaries. &euro;6.2 million was provided to Irish development NGOs and missionaries for their long-term development work in Uganda in 2011.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out the sums provided by the Government through Irish Aid to Uganda since 2005:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral programme in Uganda has achieved important results across a range of sectors.  Irish Aid has, for example, strongly supported the national education programme which now has 8.3 million pupils in primary schools compared to 2.5 million in 1997. Irish Aid has also helped to rehabilitate and build eleven primary schools and two teacher training colleges in Karamoja.  With Ireland&rsquo;s support, the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in Uganda has been cut to 6.4% compared to 18% in the 1990s and 150,000 people with HIV and AIDS in Uganda are now accessing life saving anti-retroviral drugs.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that in Uganda, Ireland uses defined instruments of support earmarked for specific development initiatives. We do not provide general budget support to the Government of Uganda. The aid programme is implemented in cooperation with a range of different partners including international and local NGOs, research institutions and Government bodies. Irish Aid has rigorous planning, monitoring, evaluation and audit mechanisms in place. This ensures that all funds are spent effectively and are used for the purposes intended. Regular and robust audits are carried out by independent audit firms as well as by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit, including internal auditors based in Uganda.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programmes operate in some of the most difficult environments in the world, but I am satisfied that the planning, monitoring, evaluating and audit systems which we have in place provide the best assurance that our aid is being used effectively and efficiently and is making a real difference for the people of Uganda.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that according to Channel 4&rsquo;s recent documentary, the Sudanese Government is using drones which contain elements made in Ireland in its targeting and killing of civilians; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that Ireland could be supplying this kind of military equipment to Sudan; and the steps he will take to ensure this is addressed immediately. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20476/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the reference in a recent television documentary that a component that appears to have been made in Ireland was part of an unmanned aerial vehicle that was used for military surveillance in Sudan.  </P>
        <P>The position of the Government is very clear in relation to the conflict in the Nuba Mountains/Southern Kordofan region which was the subject of this documentary.  We condemn unreservedly the use of aerial bombing by the Sudanese Government against the civilian population.  We have consistently called for an end to hostilities and for inclusive dialogue between the Government and insurgents to resolve differences through peaceful means.</P>
        <P>The situation in Sudan is a high priority for the European Union and was discussed again at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg yesterday.  The Council repeated the EU&rsquo;s call for dialogue to resolve the conflict in southern Kordofan and the Blue Nile region.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of United Nations and European Union initiatives aimed at restricting the flow of military equipment to Sudan and the Government is fully committed to compliance with these measures.</P>
        <P>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for issuing licenses in respect of exports of controlled goods and technology listed in the EU Dual Use Regulations and the EU Military List.  I am informed that no licenses have been issued in the past four years in respect of controlled technology intended for export to either Sudan or to the Sudanese authorities. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation works in close co-operation with the Revenue and Customs Service to monitor trade with countries against which trade sanctions are in place.</P>
        <P>I would be concerned if equipment manufactured in Ireland was being used by the military in operations against the civilian population.  Last week, I asked my officials to bring these reports to the attention of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has undertaken to examine whether any restricted or sanctioned technology is involved.  In particular, it will be important to clarify if the component apparently made in Ireland was a military or dual use item which would be subject to export control licensing, or a standard engineering component exported from Ireland which would not be subject to these conditions.</P>

	<P>The Bank&rsquo;s policy in relation to fees is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.   </P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment. However, we have observed that free banking offerings have changed significantly in recent times across the industry and that the bank must remain competitive in order to return to profitability and viability. I am informed that AIB considers its proposal to be competitive and in line with the market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question the Moriarty Tribunal made a number of observations and recommendations in relation to Financial Regulation.  The report suggests that failures in regulation in the period concerned were related more to the attitude of the Regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers or the overall system then in place. This accords with the extensive analysis of Professor Honohan which concluded that there needed to be &ldquo;a greater degree of intrusiveness and assertiveness on the part of regulators&rdquo;.  Recent reforms of the Central Bank have taken this point through new appointments at top level in the Bank; increased staffing and skills and a programme of legislative reform.</P>
        <P><i>Findings of the Report</i></P>
        <P>The Moriarty Report made the following observations and recommendations in respect of financial regulation:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The conduct of Guinness and Mahon Bank which gave rise to elements of the report (i.e. the operation of a tax avoidance scheme) failed to be regulated by the Central Bank under the last system but one (whereby there was a single Central Bank with regulatory functions). Since then the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) was established in 2003 and abolished in 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Failures in regulation were related more to the attitude of the regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The future vigilance of the regulator can best be ensured by the heightened vigilance of public representatives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These findings are consistent with those of others, such as Professor Honohan in his report on financial regulation and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P><i>Reforms of the Central Bank:</i></P>
        <P>Significant changes have recently been made to the structure governing financial regulation and oversight of the Central Bank. These matters were included in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which was a constituent part of the CBFSAI, was dissolved, the posts of Chief Executive of the Regulatory Authority and Consumer Director were abolished. Two new posts &mdash; Head of Financial Regulation and Head of Central Banking &mdash; were created.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Bank is now a single fully-integrated structure with a unitary Board, the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the stability of the financial system overall, for prudential regulation of financial institutions and for the protection of consumer interests. The Governor remains solely responsible for European System of Central Banks (ESCB) related functions.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Bank&rsquo;s statutory function of promoting the development within the State of the financial services industry was removed.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Annual Performance Statements on regulatory performance prepared by the Bank, presented to the Minister for Finance and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  (Note: this will be in addition to the Bank&rsquo;s Strategy Statement which is to be prepared at least every three years and its Annual Report and Accounts).  A committee of the Oireachtas may call the Governor and/or the Heads of Functions to be examined on the Performance Statement.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Regular international peer reviews of regulatory performance with the report of same forming part of the Performance Statement for the relevant year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the appointment of Professor Honohan as Governor and Mr. Elderfield as Head of Financial Regulation marked a significant change in attitude and approach. Mr. Elderfield is undertaking a very significant programme to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s regulatory capacity which has included the appointment of new staff at all levels within the organisation.</P>
        <P><i>Enhancing the Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central Bank:</i></P>
        <P>The Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central bank are due be strengthened via the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. The Bill responds to the regulatory failures of the financial crisis. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. It also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and will underpin the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.</P>
        <P>The Bill was published in July 2011 (Government Decision S180/20/10/1435 of 26 July 2011 refers) in accordance with the structural benchmark under the EU-IMF Programme.  The Bill completed Second Stage in October 2011 and is anticipated that it will go to Committee Stage shortly.</P>
        <P><i>Parliamentary Oversight:</i></P>
        <P>The report suggested that the necessary change of attitude by regulators to bring about increased vigilance &ldquo;can probably best be encouraged by increased vigilance on the part of elected representatives.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 enhances accountability and oversight mechanisms relating to the governance of the Bank and its regulatory performance.  A Committee of the Oireachtas will receive an annual Regulatory Performance Statement &mdash; a new mechanism to increase accountability in respect of regulatory obligations.  This is in addition to more general provisions already in the Central Bank Act 1942 relating to the appearances of the Governor and certain office holders before Oireachtas Committees.  It is also consistent with the recommendations of the C&amp;AG in his special report on the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P><i>Revenue Matters:</i></P>
        <P LI="1">Proposal 1:  Proceedings involving civil and criminal aspects</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they have put administrative arrangements in place which are designed to enable the civil and criminal aspects of appropriate cases to be managed separately when required.</P>
        <P LI="1">Proposal 2: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</P>
        <P LI="1">Proposal 3: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</P>
        <P FLI="0">In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>A further recommendation related to the transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.</P>

	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.   </P>
        <P>There is no provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products.  Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  In addition, Member States may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. In this regard, a reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</P>

	<P>The Central Bank has informed me that Chapter 9 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Documentation on Monetary Policy Instruments and Procedures (2012) contains the specific legal agreements that must be signed by counterparties who wish to conduct certain Eurosystem credit operations.  These include Master Repurchase Agreement for marketable assets, the Framework Agreement for the use of Mortgage Backed Promissory Notes and associated schedules (including, in Schedule 5, a Deed of Charge), Deed of Floating Charge over Certain Loans, which must be signed when credit claims are used for collateral purposes and Deed of Floating Charge over Eligible Securities for Liabilities arising in TARGET2-Ireland.   In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, Eurosystem monetary policy is implemented in a decentralised manner.   The Guideline of the European Central Bank of 20 September 2011 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (recast) (ECB/2011/14) provides that national central banks of the Eurosystem shall take all the appropriate measures to carry out the monetary policy operations in accordance with the principles, instruments, procedures and criteria specified in Annexes I and II to this Guideline.   Subject to this requirement, each NCB in the euro area has discretion as to the form of legal instruments it uses for collateral mobilisation. The choices reflect specificities of national law in each Member State.</P>

        <P>Finance Bill 2012 provided for a number of changes to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme as follows:</P>
        <P><i>Volume basis</i></P>
        <P>The first &euro;100,000 of qualifying R&amp;D expenditure will benefit from the 25% R&amp;D tax credit on a volume basis. The tax credit will continue to apply to incremental R&amp;D expenditure in excess of &euro;100,000 as compared with such expenditure in the base year 2003. This will provide a targeted benefit to SMEs.</P>
        <P><i>Outsourcing limits</i></P>
        <P>Before Finance Bill 2012, sub-contracted R&amp;D costs were eligible where they did not exceed 10% of total costs or 5% in the case of sub-contracting to third level institutions. This limit had the effect of disproportionately affecting smaller companies who may have greater need to outsource R&amp;D work than larger multinationals with greater internal resources. The outsourcing limits for sub-contracted R&amp;D costs were increased in Finance Bill 2012 to the greater of 5 or 10% as appropriate or &euro;100k. This will provide a targeted benefit to SMEs.</P>
        <P><i>Use of the credit to reward R&amp;D employees</i></P>
        <P>Companies in receipt of the R&amp;D credit now have the option to use a portion of the credit to reward key employees who have been involved in the development of R&amp;D. It is envisaged that there would be no additional cost to the Exchequer as the bonus comes from the R&amp;D credit already received by the company and the employee still pays the full tax liability on their other income. This change will be monitored closely and if abused will be removed.</P>

Section 45 refers specifically to the scheme which provides relief from corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies in the first three years of trading.

	<P>Section 12 of Finance Act 2012 provides for the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED). The Act was signed into law by the President on 31 March 2012.   An initial examination of the potential for extending this relief was undertaken as part of the preparations for the Finance Bill. However, I decided not to introduce such an extension pending an analysis of how the scheme beds down in practice.</P>
        <P>I have committed to undertake a review of the scheme in 2014. Depending on the outcome of that review, I will decide whether to retain the deduction or to extend it further.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Small Business, Mr. John Perry T.D., accompanied by the Secretary General from my Department, held a series of seven regional meetings around the country to discuss access to bank credit with key local stakeholders. I attended the meeting with stakeholders in Limerick. These meetings explored the findings of the Mazars survey on credit demand published by my Department late last year and examined further the actions which might be taken by the Government to improve access to credit for SMEs. These meetings are evidence of the Government&rsquo;s key priority to support the growth and development of the SME sector in Ireland.

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to the Explanatory Memorandum that was published with the Finance Bill &mdash; it contains information on each section of the Bill.  In relation specifically to the measures to support the international financial services industry, there were 13 sections in the Bill containing 21 individual measures &mdash; sections 31-35, 37, 39, 41, 42, 47, 52, 100 and 101. The package of measures are designed to support the ambitious target of creating 10,000 jobs over the next five years as set out in the <i>Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland 2011-2016  </i>which was published last July.  </P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />further easing the administrative burden in relation to non-resident investors in Irish investment funds.</P>
        <P FLI="0">None of the measures have a significant cost element and the majority are aimed at simplifying the tax treatment applying to complex financial transactions in order to make it easier to do business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Taken together with the Special Assignee Relief Programme and Foreign Earnings Deduction, the measures represent a significant package which will support the competitiveness of the international financial services industry without significant cost to the Exchequer.</P>

   <row>
    <entry>31</entry>
    <entry>In Finance Act 2010 the requirement for non-resident individuals who have invested in Irish investment funds to submit written non-resident declarations (in order to obtain exemption from exit tax) was supplemented by an alternative regime whereby the investment fund itself could put in place &ldquo;equivalent measures&rdquo; to ensure that its unit-holders are not Irish resident.  Section 31 of the Act extends the &ldquo;equivalent measures&rdquo; regime to include situations where; a) investments are made through intermediaries, and b) where a fund migrates to Ireland.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>32</entry>
    <entry>Section 32 of the Act removes a technical liability to Irish tax arising from the exchange of units in an Irish Exchange Traded Fund.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>33, 34 and 35</entry>
    <entry>One of the objectives of the UCITS IV Directive, which came into effect on 1 July 2011, is to enhance the ability of fund managers to rationalise their products and make them more cost effective.  To this end, the Directive provides for the cross-border merger of investment funds and for new &ldquo;master-feeder&rdquo; structures.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt this new Directive and changes were introduced in Finance Act 2010 in order to give the Irish industry a &ldquo;first-mover&rdquo; advantage.  Finance Act 2012 contains three further amendments to ensure that Ireland will remain as one of the leading domiciles of choice for UCITS funds. i) Section 33 amends the provisions of section 739H TCA 1997 to ensure that an Irish investor does not suffer a charge to tax on either inbound (foreign fund merges into an Irish fund) or outbound (Irish fund merges into a foreign fund) mergers.  The provisions already allow relief where units are exchanged in a reorganisation involving two Irish funds. ii) Section 34 extends the definition of a &ldquo;scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation&rdquo; in section 747E TCA 1997 to apply to exchanges of a material interest within the same offshore fund as well as between two offshore funds. iii) Section 35 amends section 739D(8D)(<i>a</i>) TCA 1997 to accommodate master/feeder structures.  The amendment is required to allow for the issue of units in a master fund directly to a foreign feeder fund in exchange for the assets of that fund.</entry>

    <entry>37</entry>
    <entry>A suite of measures was introduced in Finance Act 2010 to facilitate Islamic Finance in Ireland.  Section 37 of the Act makes two amendments to enhance the functioning of those provisions.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>39</entry>
    <entry>Section 39 amends section 198 TCA 1997 to remove a technical liability to Irish tax arising in respect of interest payments on Eurobonds as defined in section 64 TCA 1997, wholesale debt instruments within the meaning of section 246A TCA 1997, and asset covered securities within the meaning of section 3 of the Asset Covered Securities Act 2001, to a company that is resident in a non-Treaty country where that company is controlled by persons resident in a Treaty country or where the ultimate parent of that company is quoted on a stock exchange in a Treaty country. The measure aims to improve the competitiveness of the Irish debt market.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>41 and 101</entry>
    <entry>Section 41 of the Act extends the range of &ldquo;carbon offsets&rdquo; that a section 110 company can acquire to explicitly include forest carbon offsets &mdash; this is part of a broader initiative to develop a Green Financial Services Centre.  Section 101 makes a consequential amendment to the Stamp Duty Act in order to accommodate this measure.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>42</entry>
    <entry>Section 42 introduces changes to interest deductibility rules to facilitate cash-pooling business in the corporate treasury sector.  Deductibility is currently confined to payments to jurisdictions with which Ireland has a tax treaty.   The amendment allows a deduction for interest payments to group companies in non-treaty jurisdictions by reference to the tax charged on the recipient in such jurisdictions.  The change is required to facilitate cash-pooling activities of treasury operations where members of a group of companies are located in jurisdictions where Ireland does not have a tax treaty.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>47</entry>
    <entry>In response to representations from the international insurance industry in particular, section 47 extends the current group relief rules so that losses can be transferred between two Irish resident companies where those companies are part of a 75% group involving companies who are; a) resident in a jurisdiction with whom Ireland has a treaty, or b) &ldquo;quoted&rdquo; on a recognised stock exchange</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>52</entry>
    <entry>The Act extends the existing unilateral credit relief, which currently applies to royalty payments, to include equipment lease rental payments.  This allows foreign withholding taxes suffered on such payments to be offset against any Irish tax arising on same.  This measure will be of particular benefit to the aircraft leasing industry.</entry>
   </row>
   <row>
    <entry>100</entry>
    <entry>Section 100 of the Act contains nine separate stamp duty amendments which extend the range and scope of stamp duty exemptions applying to certain financial transactions and confirm the stamp duty treatment of options over shares.  The guiding principal in the case of investment funds is that stamp duty should not apply in situations where there is no change in economic ownership of the underlying assets being transferred. i)  Extension of stamp duty exemption to cover cross-border mergers of investment funds. ii)  Exemption for the transfer of Irish assets between two offshore funds (in EU/Treaty countries) in cases of reconstructions or amalgamations. iii)  Extension of the existing stamp duty exemption for the transfer of a lease (other than a lease of real property) to cover the transfer of an &ldquo;interest in a lease&rdquo;. iv)  Clarification of existing stamp duty exemption for foreign landv) Extension of the stamp duty exemption for shares/securities of foreign companies to cover a wider range of foreign legal entities vi)  Clarification in legislation that options over Irish shares are subject to the same level of duty that applies to share transfers. vii) Extension of stamp duty exemption to cover in specie transfer of pension and charity scheme assets between certain investment vehicles including unit trusts and investment companies. viii)  Extension of stamp duty exemption to cover transfer of units in an exempt unit trust. ix)  Exemption for the transfer of assets between an exempt unit trust and a corporate fund.</entry>

The programme provides for an exemption from income tax on 30% of salary between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 for employees that are assigned for a minimum of 1 year. The exemption is available for a maximum of 5 years. The scheme will operate through the PAYE system as a deduction from income tax, but USC will continue to be payable on the full income amount. Social Insurance will also be payable.</P>
        <P>The scheme has been introduced for an initial three-year period ending on 31 December 2014, in order to allow for review. Any assignee that avails of the scheme during this time will have access to the relief for the period of their assignment, up to the maximum 5 years.</P>

	<P>The present agreements underpinning the State&rsquo;s investment in the covered institutions contain prohibitions on the payment of bonuses.  This is the current position on the issue.   The Deputy will be aware that we recently published, as required under our Troika obligations, the respective relationship frameworks between the State and the banks.  These documents stipulate, amongst other matters, that the institutions will be run on a commercial basis whilst recognising the prohibition on the payment of bonuses.  The documents are also forward looking and as such allow for the consideration of incentive schemes to be adopted, in the future, to achieve the objectives of safeguarding the State&rsquo;s substantial investment into the banks and the achievement of the banks&rsquo; business plans.  Any such schemes will have to be vastly different from the versions which have helped to cause such havoc to our financial system &mdash; the focus being on long term value creation, discouraging excessive risk taking, and tied to verifiable targets to achieve the above objectives.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the Revenue Commissioners being precluded from obtaining information that is subject to legal privilege; his views on whether this new rule allows people who want to hide from the Revenue Commissioners to use legal firms to provide tax services and then claim the information was privileged. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assuming that the reference in the Deputy&rsquo;s question to a &ldquo;new rule&rdquo; in relation to legal privilege and the Revenue Commissioners relates to aspects of the mandatory disclosure regime introduced in Finance Act 2010 and contained in Chapter 3 of Part 33 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the mandatory disclosure regime, broadly speaking, requires promoters of tax based transactions which meet certain &ldquo;hallmarks&rdquo; to disclose details of them and the clients that have implemented them to the Revenue Commissioners within a short time frame of their being first marketed or used. The purpose of the regime is to act as an &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; system regarding schemes which may constitute aggressive tax avoidance so that they can be challenged and closed down before significant fiscal damage can be done. </P>
        <P>While the mandatory disclosure regime requires promoters of tax related transactions that fall within the provisions of the legislation to provide certain information to Revenue about how the scheme works, the Commissioners have also advised that the legislation explicitly provides, in section 817J of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, that a promoter will not be required to disclose information about a scheme in respect of which legal privilege could be maintained in legal proceedings. However, in such circumstances, the legislation (section 817H of that Act) places the disclosure obligation on the client and also requires the promoter to advise the client of his or her obligations in that regard, and to inform Revenue that legal privilege is being claimed.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners have further advised me that the recognition of legal professional privilege in the tax sphere is not new. Provisions similar to section 817J are contained elsewhere in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (e.g. sections 900(4), 902(9) and 902A(6)) limiting Revenue powers in situations where legal professional privilege is established. Indeed, as far back as 2002 the Revenue Commissioners and the Law Society entered into a Memorandum of Understanding concerning the audit of tax returns of solicitors and solicitors&rsquo; practices, which sets out an agreed position recognising the extent to which legal professional privilege applies in such situations.</P>
        <P>Legal privilege is a very important common law principle that provides that certain communications between a client and his solicitor are privileged and immune from subsequent disclosure to a third party. The rationale behind this principle is that it assists and enhances the administration of justice by facilitating the representation of clients by legal advisers and inducing the client to make full and frank disclosure of the relevant circumstances to the solicitor.</P>
        <P>Not including specific provisions in the mandatory disclosure legislation, firstly, to recognise and deal with legal professional privilege and, secondly, to shift the onus of disclosure from the promoter to the client in such circumstances could, I believe, given the common law principle, have resulted in the very situation described in the question arising i.e. the legal promoter could invoke the legal professional privilege defence with no statutory requirement on the client to disclose in his stead.</P>
        <P>Therefore, while the existence of legal professional privilege cannot be ignored, imposing the disclosure obligation on the client in such circumstances, ensures that the mandatory disclosure legislation works as intended and does not allow individuals who avail of tax advice from legal firms in relation to transactions that are required to be disclosed under the mandatory disclosure scheme to hide from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations.  From a public policy perspective, the Government&rsquo;s approach to address this problem is to provide a framework that will be available to all mortgage holders experiencing genuine difficulty and not just those with mortgages from the covered banks.  A number of measures are in place and are being developed in this regard.  These include the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Department of Social Protection mortgage interest supplement scheme, the proposed reform of personal insolvency legislation, the implementation of &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo;, the provision, in addition to the existing MABS service, of a more specialised mortgage advisory function and the direct engagement by the regulator with all mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies and on the development of options that lenders will make available to their customers who are experiencing difficulty with their mortgage.  Regarding the management of capital resources by the covered institutions, while I have a significant shareholding in some banks, these banks remain independent commercial entities and decisions on the appropriate commercial handling of their mortgages and other loans, within the public policy framework on mortgage arrears set out above, and in the prudent management of their capital base, is a matter for the Boards and management of the individual institutions in the exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities subject to compliance with relevant legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.</P>

	<P>The carry-over effect into 2013 of the revenue measures introduced in Budget 2012 is estimated at &euro;220 million. Therefore new revenue measures to be introduced for 2013 and to raise approximately &euro;1 billion in 2013 will be required. This information is laid out on page D.17 of Budget 2012. The precise contribution from new revenue measures in 2013 that is required in order to adhere to our budgetary targets next year will become clearer later this year taking account of more up-to-date economic and budgetary information which becomes available and decisions taken by Government.  The EU/IMF Programme Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) refers to consolidation measures that are in line with the aggregate budgetary projections set out in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement from November 2011. The MOU is an evolving document. Certain adjustments can be made to it following consultation with the Troika while maintaining respect for the overall budgetary targets. </P>

	<P>In 2011, the Central Bank carried out an initial review of the suitability of sales of payment protection insurance to customers who took out loans to determine if the sales were in compliance with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code.  The Director for Consumer Protection in the Central Bank indicated that, arising from this initial review there were concerns in relation to providers of payment protection insurance.  The Bank committed to examining these concerns in more detail and announced a &ldquo;2012 Programme of Themed Reviews and Inspections&rdquo; for consumer protection to be undertaken by the Bank. Copy of the Press Release is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Central Bank there are three types of charges associated with credit cards:   The &ldquo;acquiring bank&rdquo; (on behalf of the credit card company e.g. Visa and Mastercard) charges the retailer a fee &mdash; these fees are subject to the provisions of section 149 of the Consumer Credit 1995, if the acquiring bank is a financial institution,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The &ldquo;issuing bank&rdquo; (the issuer of the credit card on behalf of the credit card company) charges the cardholder fees, e.g. foreign exchange fees/late payment/interest fees. These fees are covered under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 as the bank is a financial institution.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Sometimes, a retailer passes fees onto the cardholder for using a credit card e.g. Ryanair/Irish Rail. These fees are not covered under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also being informed by the Central Bank that, while they have not carried out research into such charges, it would appears that credit card charges in Ireland are higher than those charged by  banks in other EU states.</P>
        <P>Section 149 of the Credit Consumer Act 1995 requires financial institutions, money transmitters and bureaux de change to notify certain charges to the Central Bank for assessment in accordance with criteria laid down in the legislation as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the promotion of fair competition between holders of authorisations and credit institutions,</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Neither the 2009 Relationship Framework nor the current Relationship Framework document force IBRC to disclose to the Minister fees paid to outside advisors. I am not aware, nor are my officials aware, of the fees charged by every advisor that has been engaged by IBRC or the former Anglo Irish Bank or the Irish Nationwide Building Society on an on-going basis. It is important to appreciate the fundamental separation of roles between the Minister and the Board of the bank in relation to IBRC and indeed the other financial institutions in which the State has an interest. This separation of roles is required by EU State Aid and Competition Authority rules. In the case of IBRC the Relationship Framework assigns responsibility for strategy, commercial policies and day to day operation to the Board of the bank. This assignment of responsibility includes a requirement to establish and ensure compliance with policies, including procurement policies, which conform to best practice in a commercial environment. General procurement matters, including the engagement of advisors, but excepting the engagement of auditors and legal advisors, are matters for the Board. These latter appointments are listed as &ldquo;reserved matters&rdquo; in the Relationship Framework documents, requiring the Minister&rsquo;s prior approval.  For the Deputy's information the current Relationship Framework document sets out in Section 26 the requirements in relation to the appointment of advisors.

	<P>IBRC operates a procurement policy which has been set by the Board.  An integral aspect of procurement is a governance process to monitor adherence to policy. The Bank&rsquo;s procurement policy is designed to ensure that goods and services are procured in the most cost-effective manner, while ensuring that the process is completed in an open, objective and transparent way.    There have been and will continue to be specific instances in which the Bank will not be able to tender publicly for a particular good or service e.g. urgency, sensitivity of a particular matter, etc. In such instances, the procurement policy allows for the CEO to give an advance waiver of this policy. A waiver is only granted by the CEO where a genuine need exists and can be justified. I am informed by the bank that the circumstances in relation to the appointment of the company referred to in the Question met the conditions to justify a waiver of the procurement policy. </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General that he conducts his audits of NAMA in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. The Standards set out the basic principles and essential procedures with which an auditor must comply. Subject to the need to comply with the Standards, the question of what audit procedures are required for any particular audit is a matter for the auditor, in this case the Comptroller and Auditor General, to decide.  Staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General who are assigned to the audit of NAMA also carry out other duties also.  During 2011, 13 individual staff members carried out work in relation to auditing and reporting on NAMA, representing almost 9 person-years of work. It is anticipated that a similar level of staff resources will be assigned to NAMA-related work in 2012.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General that it has engaged external expert advice on two occasions.</P>

The total cost of these services was &euro;31,600 inclusive of VAT.</P>
        <P>As part of the review of the NAMA property valuation by the Valuation Office, a sample of valuations was reviewed. There were no site valuations carried out on NAMA controlled properties as part of any evaluation process carried out by the C&amp;AG. All valuation reports and files were made available to the reviewers who also met with relevant NAMA personnel. The reviewers found the current market valuations for the purposes of valuing loans being acquired from the participating institutions were carried out in accordance with the standards prevailing in the industry.</P>
        <P>The second occasion was in relation to the legal due diligence process. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General used the services of a legal firm that had not been involved in the legal due diligence process in NAMA to review the process established by NAMA for the purposes of loan acquisition.

        <P FLI="0">The alignment of many F&Aacute;S training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based. This is facilitated by F&Aacute;S&rsquo; internal resource namely, the National Skills Database (NSD), as well as research by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and other relevant sources, including engagement with employers, industry and education and training providers</P>
        <P>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise and employment growth.  It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. The work of the EGFSN has allowed the Government to identify future skills shortages in certain areas, such as the ICT sector, in advance and has enabled remedial action to take place, where necessary. In addition the EGFSN drafted Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy, which forecasts Ireland&rsquo;s skills requirements up to the year 2020. An Implementation Group has been set up to establish SOLAS, which will have strategic responsibility for the further education and training sector. I am chairing this Group and its membership includes representatives from the Department of Education and Skills, F&Aacute;S, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Department of Social Protection.  The Group has been meeting regularly to drive the establishment process forward. The Heads of a Bill for the establishment have been approved by Government and have recently been referred to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting purposes.</P>

	<P>A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.

In this context, I have no immediate plans to undertake the type of review to which the Deputy refers.  </P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate in 2005.   Furthermore a review mechanism was put in place in 2005 to address the concerns of those schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme under DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.</P>
        <P>A Report on the First Phase of the Evaluation of DEIS was published by the Education Research Centre, on behalf of my Department, in January 2012. In addition a national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post-primary schools was also published by the Inspectorate of my Department in January 2012.

	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s student grant scheme, eligible candidates may receive funding provided they are attending an approved course at an approved institution as defined in the scheme.  I understand that the college referred to by the Deputy is a private college and is not listed as an approved institution for student grant purposes.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the current economic climate, I am not in a position to consider any such extension of the list of approved institutions.  However, the tuition fees payable in this case may be eligible for tax relief.  Details in relation to tax relief on tuition fees are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study.  Given the level of demand on the student grant budget from first time students and students that are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the arrangements in place.</P>
        <P>In the situation referred to by the Deputy, a student who already holds a masters qualification and intends to pursue the professional diploma in education, which is at a lower level, is not considered to be in progression and cannot be considered for funding, regardless of whether grant aid was made available to pursue the previous qualification.  However, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.</P>

	<P>The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.  A Value for Money examination of small schools has been carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future.  I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities will present as a particular challenge particularly in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy and will inform how the Government approaches the outcome of the Value for Money Study. </P>
        <P FLI="0">The Primary Staffing Appeals Board met last week.  A total of 72 small schools submitted applications to the Appeals Board.  Some 34 small schools had their appeals provisionally upheld by the Appeals Board on the basis of their projected increase in enrolments.  The retention of the classroom teachers in these 34 schools is conditional on confirmation from the schools in September that their actual enrolments reach the required level.  If the required level of enrolments is not in the schools in September then the classroom teaching posts will be automatically withdrawn and the teacher will be redeployed to another school.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s officials will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the teacher allocation and redeployment processes operate as efficiently as possible.  In this regard the Department is in regular and on-going contact with the relevant management bodies for all primary schools.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills</askee>
        <Quest> the extent to which all forms of school bullying continues to be monitored at local and national level; the extent of any new schemes proposed in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school&rsquo;s bullying policy. </P>
        <P>Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school&rsquo;s overall code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>As a further aid to post-primary schools my Department published in 2007 a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy.</P>
        <P>When a Whole School Evaluation (WSE) is conducted by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, the code of behaviour, including its anti-bullying policy, is reviewed by the inspection team to check that it is in line with the Department&rsquo;s guidelines.  Inspectors normally meet with the principal, the board, post-holders, year heads, class teachers, programme coordinators, the pastoral care team, representatives of the students and parents. During these meetings there is a particular emphasis on the quality of student care and support.  The inspectors&rsquo; evaluation is also informed by observations in classroom settings and throughout the school.  Where there are weaknesses in a school&rsquo;s policy or implementation of policies clear recommendations for improvement are made and are included in the published report of the inspection.</P>
        <P>Revised procedures for WSE in schools have recently been put in place.  A new element of the revised WSE process involves the issuing of questionnaires directly to pupils and parents.  Children and parents are asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying, discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children.  This enhanced engagement with parents and pupils through questionnaires aims to further support all schools to implement effective measures to counter bullying.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I recently announced details of a forum to explore ways to tackle the problem of bullying in schools.  This Anti-Bullying Forum is due to take place on the 17 of May 2012 and will bring together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector including parents and students.</P>
        <P>The objective of the forum will be to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.</P>
        <P>Bullying is a problem I take very seriously and I hope that the forum will provide an opportunity to set out a roadmap on how best to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.</P>
        <P>I am also establishing a working group on tackling bullying. The outcomes and recommendations from the Forum will assist the working group in its deliberations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 to 257, inclusive, and 274 together.  </P>
        <P>Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  My Department has published the staffing arrangements at primary and post primary level for the coming school year, 2012/13.  The relevant circulars, Primary 0007/2012 and Post Primary 0009/2012 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>At post primary level schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students.  Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</P>
        <P>In accordance with existing arrangements, where a post primary school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.</P>
        <P>The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the circulars referred to above.</P>
        <P>For the coming school year the existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school&rsquo;s overall allocation.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Boards operates independently of the Department and its decisions are final.</P>
        <P>The April meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board was held last week and individual schools are being notified early this week of the outcome of their appeals.</P>
        <P>The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts have been made available for allocation to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) throughout the school year, subject to qualifying applications being received.</P>
        <P>This figure represents a modest increase in the number of SNA posts allocated in recent years from 9,824 in 2007 to 10,442 in 2008, 10,342 in 2009 and 10,543 in 2010.</P>
        <P>There has therefore been no reduction in the overall number of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts available for allocation to schools this year.</P>
        <P>It is considered that with equitable management and distribution of these resources that there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require care support to attend school, in accordance with my Departments criteria.</P>
        <P>In September 2011 the NCSE allocated 10,100 posts to schools while retaining 475 posts to cover late and emergency applications.  This measure ensured that there would be sufficient posts to support all children who required such support in line with Departmental criteria.  Details of the 10,100 SNA allocations made by the NCSE have been published on their website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>By March 2012 the NCSE had allocated 10,299 WTE posts to schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should also be noted that no reduction has been made to the overall number of SNA or Resource Teaching posts which will be available for allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year.  This is representative of the Governments commitment to protecting services for children with special educational needs, at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</P>
        <P>Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16 March, 2012.  Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Five Year Plan prioritises new school building projects, including the new primary and post primary schools that I announced in June 2011, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established. </P>
        <P FLI="0">The Deputy will be aware of the demographic challenges that we are facing. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level. The Deputy will appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, that I announced on 12 March last, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The progression of school projects to construction, as set out in the Five Year Plan, to meet future demographic demand is the main focus of the Plan. In view of the funding constraints, it is not possible to progress all projects within my Department&rsquo;s building programme concurrently. Accordingly, it was necessary to prioritise school building projects already progressing within architectural planning in the context of the Plan, taking into account factors such as the funding available and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Deputy will appreciate that the announcement of the Five Year Plan represents a major change in how the school building programme is publicised. The Plan, for the first time, gives details of the schools that will progress to construction over the duration of the Plan. Those schools included in the Plan, many of which were included in previous announcements, now know when their project is likely to commence construction and they can make plans based on these timelines.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Following on from the successful outcomes of the Labour Market Activation Fund which commenced in 2010 and concluded last year, funding of &euro;20 million has been allocated from the National Training Fund in 2012 for a new Labour Market Education and Training Fund, which will be managed by F&Aacute;S and will deliver up to 6,500 education and training places.  F&Aacute;S is currently developing proposals to maximise the benefits from the funding for jobseekers in line with activation priorities.  As soon as the proposals have been sanctioned, a tender process will be established.  It is expected that F&Aacute;S will make further public announcements on the issue shortly.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Transition Year (TY) programme. As the Deputy will be aware this is a one-year programme designed to act as a bridge between the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate programmes. It is available to all second level schools.  The management authority of each school carries responsibility for making decisions regarding the Transition Year Programme in that school. In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students. In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it.  It is the board of management of each individual school that decides the number of places available to students on programmes such as Transition Year. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, provisional recognition was initially awarded to the school in question in 2008. This temporary recognition was subject to the usual rules and procedures applicable to new primary schools. Provisional recognition has been extended year on year since then. The provisional recognition period has been extended to 30th June 2012.  As part of the granting of provisional recognition it was agreed that the Inspectorate would evaluate the management and operation of the school, and the extent to which it was complying with the conditions attached to the provisional recognition, and report back to the Minister.   The Department wrote to the school late last year seeking clarification in relation to a number of items arising from the inspection and a response is awaited. Once a response is received, the matter will be further considered.</P>

Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011. The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

        <P>To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible in obtaining one qualification at each level of study thereby increasing their employment prospects.  However, tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, may be available for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses.

        <P>As I outlined at the time of my announcement of the five year programme, the criteria for selection for inclusion on the list were as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Major school projects, including special schools, which will provide for significant additional capacity to meet demographic growth with a focus on rapidly developing areas, have been prioritised.

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The stage of progression reached by each individual project in the architectural design process, including the availability of sites in the case of new schools.

	<P>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy has an application with my Department for capital funding for a major school project. Information in respect of the current status of all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years. In the context of the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of additional school accommodation, it is not possible therefore to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this school project at this time.  The Five Year Plan , which was announced on March 12 last, prioritises new school building projects, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established. In view of the funding constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet additional demographic requirements, it is not possible to progress all projects within my Department&rsquo;s building programme concurrently.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established pursuant to the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 to provide fair and reasonable financial awards to victims of institutional childhood abuse.  The Board operates independently and the application process is confidential in accordance with the terms of the 2002 Act.  Therefore, I am not in a position to comment on any individual application to the Board.</P>
        <P>My Department has however received correspondence from the legal representatives of the person to whom the Deputy refers and I can advise the Deputy that in accordance with the 2002 Act, applicants had a period of 3 years in which to submit an application to the Redress Board, that is until 15th December 2005.  Section 8 of the 2002 Act allowed the Board to extend the period for receipt of an application in exceptional circumstances.  The Board considers each submission as to why an application was not lodged in time individually.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011 removed the Board&rsquo;s power to accept late applications received on or after the 17th September, 2011.  This legislation was enacted some 8 and half years since the Board was established and 5 and half years after the initial closing date.  I am satisfied that sufficient time has been given to potential applicants to apply to the Redress Board.  The Board undertook an extensive advertising campaign, utilising press, television and radio advertising and held information days and distributed leaflets and pamplets. In addition, there has also been press advertising by solicitors which served to inform people of the Board&rsquo;s existence.  The Board undertook further advertising in 2011.</P>
        <P>By the final cut-off date in September, 2011, the Board had received 2,766 late applications.  At end March 2012, the Board had allowed 1,136 late submissions to be considered as valid applications.  The Board has a further 1,256 late submissions to consider.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the new residential institutions redress scheme is limited to those who received an award under the Residential Institutions Redress Acts 2002 to 2011; and the rationale for such limits which will have the effect of preventing those who suffered abuse from receiving justice. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The recently published Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill provides that those former residents who received financial awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or similar awards or settlements in court proceedings, will be eligible to apply for assistance from the Statutory Fund.  While the Residential Institutions Redress Board is continuing to process its remaining applications, it is likely that in the region of 15,000 former residents will successfully complete the redress process and be eligible to apply. The Deputy will be aware that while applicants initially had three years to apply to the Redress Board, it continues to consider late applications in exceptional circumstances, where the applications were received by 17th September last year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having regard to the maximum funds available of &euro;110 million and the potential pool of the 15,000 applicants, I believe that the approach taken to eligibility is correct.   If eligibility were significantly widened to include, for example, all former residents of scheduled institutions, then the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be greatly reduced and the effectiveness of the Statutory Fund could be put at risk.  Recipients of redress awards have been through a fair but thorough process. Provision is included in the Bill to allow the Redress Board advise the Statutory Fund of the name, address and date of birth of award recipients. Such a provision will allow the Fund to confirm applicants&rsquo; eligibility and minimise the associated administration.</P>
        <P>Some former residents may, as was their right, have chosen not to make an application to the Redress Board but every encouragement was given to them to apply: there was extensive advertising of the Redress Scheme which has operated for some nine years.  Of course, any former resident who will not be eligible for assistance from the Fund can continue to avail of the National Counselling Service and the Family Tracing Service.  While I believe that this is the correct approach at this stage, I would nevertheless note that the issue of who is eligible to apply for assistance could be reviewed following the establishment of the Statutory Fund, in the event of the applications to the Fund not resulting in a significant expenditure of the Fund.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual&rsquo;s application form and supporting documentation, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student should qualify for a grant.</P>
        <P>I understand from the awarding authority in question that the issue relates to the student&rsquo;s request to be assessed as an independent mature student.  Documentary evidence is required as proof of a student&rsquo;s independent address from 1st October of the year prior to entry into college.  The documentary evidence normally required includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or electricity bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary evidence that provides an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period. For example, while an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.  Individual circumstances should be discussed by an applicant with his/her grant awarding authority. The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof is submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the schemes.</P>
        <P>Where a grant application is refused, the reason for the refusal is given by the grant awarding authority.</P>
        <P>An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant awarding authority. Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>No appeal has been received in my Department to date.</P>

	<P>Recommendation 62.15 of the Moriarty Tribunal Report (March 2011) is that the Standards Commission could appoint an inspector to audit the financial affairs of an office holder, within meaning of the Ethics Acts, by the voluntary and positive election of the office holder, at any time during his/her period in office and for a defined period thereafter. </P>
        <P>I am examining another possible approach, namely, to allow the Standards Commission to audit an office holder&rsquo;s financial affairs, but only in the case of an investigation by the Commission of the office holder for an infringement of the Ethics Acts or the Electoral Acts involving his personal financial affairs. Such an approach would allow an office holder&rsquo;s financial affairs to be audited where there is a real concern about standards in public life.</P>
        <P>Following the recent Government Decision responding to the Mahon Tribunal, I am reviewing the detailed set of recommendations contained in the Mahon Report related to ethics as well as those contained in the Moriarty Report in order to formulate proposals for those recommendations falling to his Department to progress.</P>
        <P>In that context, I will consider in consultation with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government and the Attorney General what steps may be necessary in terms of root-and-branch reworking of the ethics framework.</P>

	<P>The National Procurement Service (NPS) in the Office of Public Works has responsibility for initiatives in procurement to achieve efficiencies and value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment in 2009, the NPS has made continuous efforts to ensure that Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are able to take full advantage of the public procurement opportunities that arise and are available to them. This includes the promotion of the use of eTenders by SMEs to gain access to public sector tenders.</P>
        <P>The NPS, in conjunction with the SME representative bodies such as the SFA and ISME, facilitate seminars for SMEs, which cover all the issues relating to competing for public procurement contracts, including accessing public tenders through the use of eTenders.</P>
        <P>Workshops were also delivered in 2011 on public procurement opportunities in association with Enterprise Ireland and IntertradeIreland. At all of these events the eTenders platform is promoted.</P>
        <P>Following a procurement process, to find a new platform to replace the current eTenders platform, a preferred tenderer will shortly be appointed. Once this contract has been signed a concerted communication and advertising campaign will be put in place to encourage suppliers to sign up to eTenders. It should be noted that the number of suppliers registered on eTenders has risen from just over 50,000 suppliers when the NPS took control of the site in 2009 to 72,876 suppliers now. The Deputy may wish to note that, to date, 1405 suppliers have registered for the month of April. Also, it should be noted that in the order of 3,000 SMEs have benefitted directly from training in supplier events organised or participated in by the National Procurement Service.</P>

	<P>The Moriarty and Mahon Tribunal Reports were discussed when they were brought to Government.  Neither I nor my officials have attended any meetings recently regarding recommendations in the Moriarty and Mahon Tribunal Reports. </P>
        <P>I am reviewing the detailed set of recommendations contained in the Mahon Tribunal Report related to ethics as well as those contained in the Moriarty Tribunal Report in order to formulate proposals for those recommendations falling to my Department to progress.</P>
        <P>In that context, I will consider in consultation with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government and the Attorney General what steps may be necessary in terms of root-and-branch reworking of the ethics framework.</P>

	<P>I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />less use of &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; tendering procedures and greater use of &ldquo;open&rdquo; tendering;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Circular 10/10 has been in place for little over a year. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small and Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</P>

        <P>A single individual with a public service pension in excess of &euro;100,000 is subject to a 20 per cent PSPR charge on each euro in excess of &euro;100,000.  This PSPR charge is deductible for Income Tax and USC purposes. Therefore, the balance is subject to a 41 per cent tax rate and 7 per cent USC rate (4 per cent if the individual is aged 70 years or over or in receipt of a full medical card). It should be noted that for the purpose of this reply, the effective tax rate takes account of the following deductions and taxes: Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), Income Tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC).</P>

	<P>The National Procurement Service (NPS) in the Office of Public Works has responsibility for initiatives in procurement to achieve efficiencies and value for money for the Irish taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Since its formation in 2009, the NPS has put in place a number of national contracts for use by all Government Departments, Offices and Agencies. Prior to this, the Government Supplies Agency (GSA) had put in place contracts for use by Government Departments only.  Due to their availability to a wider number of clients, all of the contracts put in place by the NPS are larger than those previously put in place.</P>
        <P>The NPS has made continuous efforts to ensure that Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are able to take full advantage of the public procurement opportunities that arise and are available to them.</P>
        <P>The NPS facilitate seminars for SMEs, which cover all the issues relating to competing for public procurement contracts, including: Public Procurement regulations, accessing the market opportunities, the tendering process and general guidance on how companies should approach the preparation of tenders. A number of seminars were delivered to ISME and to Chambers of Commerce in 2010 and 2011. Workshops were also delivered on public procurement opportunities in association with Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade Ireland. The NPS has also produced a leaflet &ldquo;Top Tendering Tips for Public Sector Contracts&rdquo;, which is freely available.</P>
        <P>A significant development in the area of facilitating the SME sector was the publication, by the Department of Finance, in August 2010 of Circular 10/10. These guidelines to public contracting authorities aim to ensure that tendering processes are carried out in a manner that facilitates participation by SMEs, while ensuring that all procurement is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent and secures optimum value for money for the taxpayer. It addresses the concerns that SMEs have regarding access to public procurement opportunities and highlights practises that are to be avoided where they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts. These arrangements include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />greater open advertising of opportunities (threshold now &euro;25,000),</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a reduced requirement for paperwork (such as accounts) at the early stages of tendering,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />an instruction that suppliers are not to be charged for access to tender opportunities,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />an assurance that all criteria used would be appropriate and proportionate, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />an instruction that turnover and insurance levels would be set at proportionate levels.</P>
        <P FLI="0">NPS policy seeks to encourage participation by SMEs in public sector competitions. SMEs that believe the scope of a competition is beyond their technical or business capacity are encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. The NPS tender documentation for larger contracts allows and encourages SMEs to come together to bid for these contracts. Larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs can be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from a tendering exercise.</P>
        <P>The NPS has conducted a major consultation process involving all energy stakeholders including: the Commissioner for Energy Regulation (CER); Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Energy providers and public service clients. Due to the nature of the energy market, the need to encourage greater competition and the potential size of the public service demand it was apparent that there was a distinct risk that a single public service contract would distort the market. The NPS concluded that the optimum procurement strategy for electricity and natural gas would, therefore, be through the use of multi party framework agreements.</P>
        <P>The NPS conducted an EU competitive tender process which has resulted in Electricity and Natural Gas framework agreements being put in place for supply to the public sector. There are five different companies on the Electricity Framework and seven separate companies on the Natural Gas Framework.</P>

	<P>This matter is currently being discussed at EU level as part of the proposed amendments to the Procurement Directives and my Department is represented on the working group engaged in the process of considering the proposals.  In the absence of an EU wide system to ensure compliance with employment and equality legislation, we will consider whether appropriate measures can be taken in the procurement process.  Nonetheless we have already taken steps through the performance of the Public Works Contracts to ensure that a contractor must comply with relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>Sub-clause 5.3.3(8) of the Pay and Conditions of Employment in the Public Works Contract requires the main contractor and all subcontractors employed by main contractors, to observe, in relation to the employment of workers on the site, compliance with employment law generally, including, for example, the relevant Registered Employment Agreements, existing statutory requirements such as the national minimum wage, legally binding determinations under the Industrial Relations Acts, health and safety legislation and equality legislation relating to employment.</P>
        <P>The Public Works Contracts also requires a main contractor to provide a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) with each interim statement submitted (normally on a monthly basis).  The certification includes observance of the requirements under Sub-clause 5.3.3(8).  Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority.  If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance and it is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor. This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right. The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.</P>
        <P>The management of a public works contract is a matter between a contracting authority and a main contractor.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contractors comply with all the requirements of the contract.  If the Deputy is aware of any non-compliance he should contact the relevant contracting authority directly.</P>
        <P>It is possible that as part of the public procurement tendering process a company could be awarded a public works contract where a contracting authority may not be aware of any outstanding judgements by the Labour Court made against a tenderer because there is not a mechanism equivalent to the tax clearance certificate system in place for compliance with employment law.</P>

	<P>The Moriarty Tribunal made two recommendations for changes to company law, as follows: That a provision similar to section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 be adopted, together with the adoption of additional implementation or enforcement measures.  That consideration be given by the Oireachtas, and/or by the Company Law Review Group, to enacting provisions similar to those contained in Part 14 of the UK Companies Act 2006, governing the control of political donations and expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Government considered that provisions in the forthcoming Companies Bill, which will consolidate and give a statutory footing to the duties of directors, meet the objectives of the first recommendation above.  The first, and main, part of the Companies Bill, including the provisions on directors&rsquo; duties, was published in &ldquo;soft copy&rdquo; in May 2011.</P>
        <P>With regard to the second recommendation above, the Government intends to impose restrictions on corporate donations within electoral, and not company, law. Accordingly, provisions to this effect are contained in the Electoral Amendment (Political Funding) Bill, which comes within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and which is currently before the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The focus of my visit to China was to provide opportunities for exporters to increase their profile with prospective trade buyers and expand access to existing and potential customers across as many business sectors as possible.  The trade mission was focused on the enterprise to enterprise aspects of doing business with China.  Consequently, the mission was organised by Enterprise Ireland (EI) with participants drawn from the business sector and especially from the agency&rsquo;s client base.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that some time ago EI was in communication with Dublin City Council (DCC) in relation to developing links with Beijing in the context of a Taoiseach led mission but that the Council decided to proceed with its own initiative at an earlier date.  EI&rsquo;s Beijing manager helped assist the Council in its twinning initiative in June 2011.  Participation by non EI clients, including public authorities, on trade missions can be considered on a case by case basis and where this will provide tangible added value to Ireland&rsquo;s trade and investment objectives.</P>

	<P>The Development Capital Scheme as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs has been developed to complement the existing suite of financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland.  A range of other initiatives are already in place for the provision of capital at the early stage and scaling phases, and a clear market failure was identified in the availability of risk capital for established companies seeking to sustain growth and achieve greater scale. </P>
        <P>Longer-term investment capital is currently not readily available to Irish growth focused companies in either the form of debt or equity, and there is very limited private equity funds/debt available to innovative SMEs.  This situation has resulted in an equity gap, which is constraining the development of a key cohort of established Irish growth companies.  Development Capital can be defined as equity funding for the expansion of established and profitable firms, that is, those that have passed the start-up stage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Scheme was launched on the 12 April 2012 and a call was issued by Enterprise Ireland for &ldquo;<i>expressions of interest&rdquo;</i>, from fund managers.  This &ldquo;call&rdquo; allows for a three month period before a closing date.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Exchequer funding requirement for this scheme is &euro;50m over 10 years.  It is proposed that Enterprise Ireland will commit &euro;25m each to two funds which will leverage a further &euro;50m each from the private sector. Any fund investments supported by EI under this scheme would be made under the &ldquo;<i>market economy investor principle&rdquo;</i>   seeking a maximum return for the State by sharing equally in the risks alongside other investors.  The scheme will focus on funds that provide equity or quasi debt of between &euro;2m to &euro;10m per investment although it is likely that many investments would be in the &euro;2m to &euro;5m range.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The second call referred to by the Deputy relates to <i>Innovation Fund Ireland</i>. The second call for expressions of interest under that Fund was issued on 16 March 2012.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 318 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions concern a dispute between the company and twenty employees in relation to a claim for enhanced redundancy terms of four weeks pay per year of service in addition to statutory redundancy entitlements, following the acquisition of the company and the closure of its Dublin offices in 2011.</P>
        <P>The company rejected the workers&rsquo; claim for enhanced redundancy terms and, following failure to resolve the dispute at local level, the matter was referred to the Labour Court for adjudication, in accordance with Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. A Labour Court recommendation under Section 20(1) is binding on the union, but not on the company.</P>
        <P>A Labour Court hearing took place on the 20 January, 2011.</P>
        <P>Having considered the position of both sides the Labour Court recommended that the claimants should be paid an ex-gratia redundancy payment equal to four weeks&rsquo; pay inclusive of the statutory payment already paid.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding.  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations.  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</P>
        <P>I understand that the company has complied with its obligations in respect of statutory redundancy payments and that  a total of 35 redundancy rebate claims have been made to the Department of Social Protection in respect of the company concerned.</P>

	<P>The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, on which legislation was published on 3 April, is designed to address two specific market failures, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. inadequacy of collateral (Pillar 1) and</P>
        <P LI="1">2. inadequacy of bank understanding of novel aspects of the business environment, particularly in the areas of new markets, new technologies and business models (Pillar 2), which may restrict the bank&rsquo;s ability to offer certain lending products as they are perceived as a higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</P>
        <P FLI="0">SMEs in these two categories are eligible to access the Guarantee Scheme.</P>
        <P>For lenders to participate, we will require a detailed consideration of how the lender will use the Scheme to support lending over and above that currently being achieved. In order to demonstrate an understanding of the additionality principle, lenders will be requested to provide examples of where the Scheme could have been used in the past &mdash; i.e. examples of viable lending applications that were declined specifically due to the circumstances that the Scheme is intended to address.</P>
        <P>By training participating lenders on the scheme criteria at the outset and requiring specific declarations to be made in connection with each facility guaranteed in terms of loan viability and/or the two market failures set out above and then following-up with appropriate monitoring over the life of the Scheme, it is possible to ensure that additionality is consistently being monitored and achieved.</P>
        <P>The design parameters of the Scheme and the proposed three year timespan of the scheme will ensure that the State&rsquo;s exposure is capped and will deliver an overall risk share of approximately 50:50 between the State and the Banks over the lifetime of the Scheme.  In that way, both parties (Lender and Guarantor) are demonstrating a joint commitment to addressing market failures with regard to meeting the borrowing requirements of Irish SMEs.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that Scheme-related performance and behaviours will be closely monitored and reviewed, and that data will be analysed on a regular basis. The Operator chosen to run the Scheme (Capita) will be responsible for the data-gathering, analysis and the reporting process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323, 326, 329 to 331, inclusive, 333 to 336, inclusive, 339 to 343, inclusive, 345 to 349, inclusive, 351 to 354, inclusive, and 356 to 358, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Questions the Deputy has raised relate to measures the Government undertook to deliver in the first Quarter of 2012 as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  The first Progress Report on the Action Plan was published by the Government on 20 April and provides a detailed update on the specific issues covered in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.djei.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Eighty of the 83 measures due for delivery across the whole of Government in the first Quarter of 2012 have been implemented.  These measures include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The launch of the &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo; initiative, aimed at delivering at least 5,000 jobs in five years.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Launch of a new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland, targeting 1,800 new exporting companies.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The publication of legislation for the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The design and launch of the new &euro;150 million Development Capital Scheme, aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth companies.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The issue of a global second call under Innovation Fund Ireland worth more than &euro;60 million, to target investment in high-growth technology companies.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The allocation of &euro;20 million to a new Education and Training Fund.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The extension and simplification of the employer PRSI exemption scheme; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The enactment of the Finance Bill, giving effect to several pro-jobs measures.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, this is just the first stage in delivering on the Action Plan for Jobs.  We will build on this work over the coming months and a further Progress Report will be published in July.  I fully expect that the three measures which were not fully completed during the first Quarter of the year will be implemented in the Second Quarter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 and 325 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group was approved by Government on the 21 of February this year to be implemented as a whole of Government Policy goal. The Government agreed to the publication of the report, the future alignment of public investment with the 14 areas of priority identified in the Report, and appropriate cross-Government coordinated oversight and independent review mechanisms to give effect to the recommendations and take stock of their implementation. Minister Bruton and I launched the report on the 1 of March.</P>
        <P>Research prioritisation will be implemented under the authority of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs and a Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) has been established to drive implementation. In order to reinforce political and policy commitment to the research prioritisation agenda, I personally chair this Group and its membership comprehends those Departments that are members of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation and relevant research funding Agencies under the remit of those Departments.</P>
        <P>The PAG had its first meeting on 28 March and the intention is that it will meet on a monthly basis initially at least. At the first meeting we agreed a modus operandi for implementation which includes a focus on the 14 priority areas as well as systemic changes recommended in the Report to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the STI system. In relation to the 14 priority areas the intention is to develop Action Plans for each of these areas and that process has begun. In relation to the systemic actions these will be tackled simultaneously yet systematically with varying approaches depending on the nature of the change which is required.</P>
        <P>At its first meeting the PAG decided to prioritise implementation of a number of the system changes recommended and this included, in particular, those relevant to the establishment of a framework for monitoring implementation of prioritisation. Work is underway to agree macro level indicators to measure the impact of investment on the overall STI system in the first instance and the next phase of this work will be to establish micro level indicators to measure impact on the individual priority areas. It is expected that the first phase of this work will be complete by mid-year with the next stage due to be completed by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is clear that individual research funders are already aligning their funding calls with the priority areas recommended. This is exemplified in the recent call for proposals issued by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under their research centres programme. A central component of the new programme is that each new SFI research centre will be aligned with one or more of the prioritisation areas identified by the Report of the Steering Group on Research Prioritisation.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</askee>
        <Quest> if he is satisfied item 1.12 of the jobs action plan has been implemented; when he expects legislation reforming wage setting mechanisms to pass; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 1.12 of the Action Plans for Jobs provides for a commitment to enact legislation to reform wage setting mechanisms.</P>
        <P>To this end, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 was published on 22 December 2011. The Bill has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is currently awaiting Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system. The reform of the legal framework for underpinning this system is aimed at increasing employers&rsquo; ability to retain and employ workers, particularly in sectors hard hit by the prevailing economic circumstances and to facilitate necessary cross-sector adjustment.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the EROs and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</P>
        <P>The fact that the process of making EROs was found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with the identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of this process, only underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the Duffy/Walsh report.</P>
        <P>The commissioning of the independent review of the ERO and REA systems was one of the undertakings given by the last Government in the context of the EU and IMF-supported financial assistance programme for Ireland.</P>
        <P>When enacted, this Bill, will implement the programme of reforms to the JLC/REA systems agreed by Government in July 2011. It will radically overhaul the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wrote to my Ministerial colleagues in March, asking them to examine all charges which are levied on business by their Departments and associated bodies, with a view to identifying which charges can be reduced, or frozen to the end of 2013 or beyond.</P>
        <P>My officials are currently preparing a composite overview of the responses from Government Departments and the bodies under their aegis.</P>
        <P>I can confirm, at this stage, that a number of areas have been identified where charges are being reduced or frozen.  These include charges relating to certain areas of the Agriculture sector, the aviation and transport sectors, the tourism sector, as well as patent and design fees.</P>
        <P>In addition, 68 of the 88 Local Authorities have maintained their Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV) at 2011 levels, while a further 19 have reduced theirs.  One Local Authority has increased its ARV, but this is a technical adjustment following the extension of a town boundary.  The freezing or reduction of ARVs by the vast majority of Local Authorities will have a positive impact on the commercial rates of enterprises in these Local Authority areas.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, TD, is continuing to examine other charges on business in the agencies and bodies under his remit, to determine the scope for further reductions or freezing of such charges.  The Minister will revert to me when this exercise is complete.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no record of a Permit application being received in my Department in respect of the above named.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice and Equality determines the immigration status of persons within the State. A student on an Immigration Stamp 2, issued by the Department of Justice and Equality, is permitted to remain in Ireland to pursue a course of studies and is permitted to engage in casual employment which is defined as not more than 20 hours per week during term, and up to 40 hours per week during holidays. A student on a Stamp 2 is prohibited from engaging in full time employment and cannot be issued with an employment permit unless they have been granted permission to remain by the Department of Justice and Equality under the &ldquo;Third Level Graduate&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Timed-Out Student&rdquo; Schemes.   Full details of both of these Schemes can be found on the Department of Justice and Equality website at <i>http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Students</i>.  The purpose of the permission to remain in the State under these Schemes is to seek employment and apply for a Green Card or Work Permit under normal criteria.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />positions requiring specialist or scarce skills, expertise or qualifications which, otherwise, cannot be filled.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</askee>
        <Quest> if he will provide on a county basis a breakdown of the number of new enterprises established under the auspices of the Industrial Development Authority since 2006. </Quest>
        <QRef>[20411/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the period 2006-2011 there have been 156 new enterprises established in this country under the auspices of IDA Ireland providing almost 5,000 new jobs. This figure is broken down on a county by county, year by year basis in the tabular statement below.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to this country and its regions. At present there are almost 1,000 client companies employing almost 140,000 people.</P>
        <P>The importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Irish economy remains highly significant. In addition to exports, FDI accounts for a total of 250,000 jobs (1 in every 7 jobs) in the Irish economy and &euro;19 billion spend on Irish sourced goods and services including &euro;6.9 billion in payroll. Companies who have chosen Ireland as the location for their FDI operations include 9 of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies, 8 of the top 10 US ICT companies, 17 of the top 25 medical device companies, more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s leading financial services firms, the top 10 &lsquo;born on the internet&rsquo; companies and 3 of the world&rsquo;s top 5 games companies.</P>
        <P>In 2011 there was a record of 148 investments won by IDA Ireland and the immediate outlook for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign investment portfolio is positive with a short term pipeline in place. However, it must be remembered that it can take 3 to 5 years between the announcement of an investment and the creation of jobs from that announcement.</P>

	<P>Details of the number of site visits by potential investors to locations in Ireland on a county by county basis in each of the years 2006 to 2011 is set out in the tabular statement below.</P>
        <P>One of the high level goals in IDA&rsquo;s Strategy &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; is a commitment that by 2014, 50% of all Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  The global economy and in particular the European economy, which is the primary target market for FDI clients in Ireland, is in a low growth phase. The challenge for IDA Ireland is to win FDI in this low growth environment. There is intense and continual international competition to win this FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million i.e. London, Manchester, Singapore, Amsterdam, Boston, Los Angeles etc.</P>
        <P>As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  IDA also promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.</P>
        <P>Typically, a company is shown three or four locations within a Gateway Economic Region that can meet its requirements and, in certain cases, other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis. In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland will endeavour to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in view of</askee>
        <Quest> his proposal to amalgamate employment rights bodies, if he intends to address the unique feature of employment equality cases; if he will make reference to rights enforcement or the concept of anti-discrimination; if he will address the unique investigative nature of employment equality hearings. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>When I came into office last year I identified that people wishing to vindicate their equality and employment rights in the workplace were experiencing serious problems including long delays in having their complaints adjudicated.  The problems had been well documented and the issues had been extensively reviewed over many years.  The system was so complex that even practitioners had difficulty understanding and accessing it.  There were, and in some cases still are, long delays scheduling hearings and further delays in issuing decisions. I did not believe that this was an acceptable level of service.</P>
        <P>I have commenced a reform process to address these issues. I am committed to delivering world-class workplace relations service to deal with equality and employment related issues.  This reform will bring about major improvements while at the same time incorporating the best practice elements of existing dispute resolution bodies including the Equality Tribunal.  My aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</P>
        <P>I intend to establish a new body of Body of First Instance, to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The WRC will have a considerable role in promoting good workplace practices through the proactive provision of information and advice.  It will also provide an adjudication service for workplace equality complaints.</P>
        <P>The promotion of equality in the workplace is currently a matter for the Equality Authority and will be a matter for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission when the Equality Authority is merged with the Human Rights Commission.  The WRC will cooperate with the Human Rights and Equality Commission in relation to the promotion of good workplace practices.</P>
        <P>The main aims of my reform proposals are to increase compliance with employment and equality law, reduce disputes and, where they do arise, provide  a just, fair and efficient adjudication service.  This Adjudication Service will be provided by independent, professional and impartial decision makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing, in the vast majority of cases.  Decisions will be published.  This will be a major improvement for complainants and respondents over the existing system.</P>
        <P>On establishment of the WRC, its Adjudicators will be drawn from the existing serving officers within the workplace relations services.  The skills and experience of the Equality Mediation/Adjudication Officers and of the existing panel of Rights Commissioners will be utilised.  This will ensure that the body of expertise and knowledge built up by these bodies and officers will be brought to bear on the new service.</P>
        <P>A common standard of practice, compatible with the intended objective of providing a speedy, inexpensive and relatively informal means for dispute resolution will be adopted for WRC hearings.  All hearings will be required to comply with the principles of natural and constitutional justice. Therefore, while hearings of the WRC will not follow strict rules similar to courts of law, fair procedures should be followed.</P>
        <P>The aim will be to deliver a high standard in adjudication while ensuring that the statutory independence of WRC Adjudicators in their decision-making on complaints is not compromised.</P>
        <P>The website, <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>, will contain all information, legislation and forms for making an employment or equality complaint or appeal.  It will also publish all precedent decisions.  Periodic reviews of decided cases will be undertaken and these will be categorised and made publicly available. This will be of benefit to those considering making a complaint or who have had a complaint made against them and to those providing information to employers and employees.</P>
        <P>I am firmly of the view that the reforms I am proposing will be of considerable benefit to ensuring compliance with employment and equality law and where complaints are made they will be dealt with in a timely fair and consistent manner.</P>

	<P>I am considering the issue of whether a fee for making a complaint or appeal to the new Workplace Relations bodies, which will be established as part of the reform process, should be introduced.  However, I have made no decision in this regard yet.  I recently published a <i>Blueprint</i> which sets out, in considerable detail, how reform of the workplace relations structures and processes will be achieved.  The document also provides a further opportunity for interested parties to contribute comments and feedback on the future design and operation of the State&rsquo;s workplace relations structures including whether or not a charge should be introduced.  </P>
        <P>I indicated in the <i>Blueprint</i> that any fee introduced would be a modest administration fee somewhere in the region of &euro;50.  It would be configured in such a way as to encourage early resolution.  For example one possibility would be that no fee would apply for the Early Resolution Service with the fee only being charged when a case progresses to a hearing. In addition any fee would likely take into account the considerable additional cost incurred by the state associated with the processing of paper based complaint forms.  Therefore the fee may only apply to paper based complaints with a lesser or no fee applying to complaints submitted and processed online.</P>
        <P>It is certainly not my intention that any fee introduced would deter individuals from vindicating their rights under equality or employment legislation.  I am open, as part of the consultation process on the <i>Blueprint </i>document, to constructive suggestions and advice from all interested parties in relation my reform proposals including the issue of charging a fee.</P>

	<P>In December 2011, the European Commission launched a &ldquo;Youth Opportunities Initiative&rdquo; in response to the growing problem of youth unemployment across the EU.  The Commission&rsquo;s communique of 20 December 2011 set out a number of actions which will be financed directly by the Commission as part of the Initiative.  These include measures to be supported by the European Social Fund and by the ERASMUS and Leonardo da Vinci programmes.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for the management and operation of the European Social Fund in Ireland and for administering the ERASMUS and Leonardo da Vinci programmes.  I understand that Department has been examining the potential to provide further support for youth unemployment through these mechanisms.</P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies do not operate programmes which are directly targeted at addressing youth unemployment.  However, many young people will benefit from the employment opportunities that will arise from the Action Plan for Jobs.  They will also benefit from the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s labour market initiative, Pathways to Work.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Department of Finance that it is not possible to provide details of taxes forgone in respect of a particular age cohort, as all individuals under 65 years of age in the same circumstances are taxed at the same rate.  </P>
        <P>It has previously been estimated that each person who is unemployed costs the State approximately &euro;20,000 per annum in terms of social welfare payments and tax and PRSI forgone.  It should be borne in mind, however, that Jobseekers payments vary depending on personal circumstances, the individual&rsquo;s PRSI contribution record and by age category in relation to Jobseekers Allowance for those under 25 years of age.</P>
        <P>The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, for the fourth Quarter of 2011, indicates that 59,700 people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.  The Government is responding to the issue of youth unemployment through the measures outlined its labour market initiative, Pathways to Work, which includes various training, education and work experience measures delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.</P>

	<P>A report produced in January by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) entitled <i>Addressing High-Level ICT Skills Recruitment Needs </i>   confirms that Ireland is a successful major centre for ICT operations with around 75,000 people employed in 8,000 companies. Indeed, ten of the top ICT companies in the world having substantial operations in Ireland. </P>
        <P>The research undertaken by the Group, the Secretariat to which is provided by Forf&aacute;s, indicates that the global ICT market is expected to grow by 5% between 2009 and 2014/15 with potential growth rate as high as 20% per annum over the next decade. In order to exploit these opportunities, however, it is crucial to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s labour force is appropriately skilled. In this context the Group&rsquo;s report found that there are a range of skills and recruitment difficulties within the ICT sector with the result that, as at December 2011, there were approximately 1,800 vacancies in the sector. These vacancies arose mainly due to the lack of graduates with high-level ICT Honours Degrees and above which are required to fill such positions as Computer Software Engineers, ICT Network Specialists and Engineers, ICT Security Experts, ICT Telecommunications, ICT Project Managers and IT Sales and Marketing/Foreign Languages Skills Personnel. The report points out that this challenge is not unique to Ireland as such high level ICT skills are also in short supply globally.</P>
        <P>In order to address these challenges I, along with my colleague, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills, subsequently launched the <i>ICT Action Plan: Meeting the High Level ICT Skills Needs of Enterprise in Ireland</i>. The Action Plan establishes an overreaching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018 and outlines a number of actions that will be implemented to ensure an increased output of appropriately skilled graduates in the medium term 2015-2018.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs highlights the need to align skills with enterprise needs and outlines a number of actions in this regard, including our intention to implement the ICT Action Plan. Progress made in implementing these actions will be monitored on a quarterly basis. Last week&rsquo;s progress report on the Jobs Strategy confirms that Action 1.35, which calls for an immediate response to the challenges in the ICT sector, has been implemented in quarter 1 by:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />maximising the uptake on programmes such as Springboard; and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />establishing a high level ICT foresight Group to ensure that the higher education programmes in ICT are aligned to changing needs. This Group met in January and will reconvene in June 2012 to further consider the findings of the ICT Action Plan.</P>

The CEBs also provide a range of indirect non-financial assistance such as business advice, mentoring, management capability training and development programmes.</P>
        <P>The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.

	<P>The free travel scheme provides for free travel for eligible persons on qualifying public transport services.  Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments (including disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance) are eligible for the scheme.  While medical evidence will be required to determine eligibility for these schemes, it does not entitle anyone to free travel.  It is the fact of being in receipt of a qualifying payment rather than the fact of having a disability that gives rise to the entitlement.  Should a person with epilepsy qualify for invalidity pension or disability allowance (depending on their level of disability as a result of the epilepsy) they would be entitled to free travel.</P>

	<P>The targets detailed in <i>Pathways to Work</i> seek to ensure that those who are unemployed for more than twelve months will have access to supports that enable them to return to active employment.  The objective is to ensure that those who become unemployed during the course of this plan receive the advice and support necessary to help them secure an early return to employment.  Whilst there will be a particular focus on the long-term unemployed the Department of Social Protection will engage with each person who becomes unemployed in the future with a view to reducing the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months today to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</P>
        <P>Given limited public resources activation measures will be targeted at those groups who are most at risk of long-term unemployment as well as those who would benefit most from interventions.  The development of the Probability of Exit (PEX) profiling model by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the ESRI will facilitate the targeted focusing of resources.  The Department of Education and Skills will provide in excess of 450,000 training and education places in 2012.  These places together with the circa 85,000 job placement and work experience places provided by my Department include provision for school leavers and self-referred clients.  At a time of reduced resources these places represent a real commitment to ensuring that all those who are unemployed are given every support to return to employment.</P>

At the 30th of March last there were 62,717 people aged up to and including 24 years of age on the live register who were not engaged in employment, education or training.  This represents 14.5% of the total number of people on the live register as published at that date.

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the invalidity pension claim of the person concerned was disallowed following an assessment by a Medical Assessor who expressed the opinion that he was medically unsuitable for the allowance.  An appeal was registered on 14 November 2011 and in accordance with the statutory procedures the relevant department papers and the comments of the Deciding Officer on the matter raised in the appeal have been sought.  In that context, an assessment by another Medical Assessor will be carried out.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Following changes to the training and materials grant for Community Employment schemes announced in Budget 2012, the Department of Social Protection have made a commitment that no Community Employment Scheme would close pending the completion of a review.  This review is now close to completion.  All Community Employment Scheme Sponsors are working with the Department&rsquo;s Community Development Officers to ensure that there is adequate funding for the continuation of their Community Employment projects.  In West Limerick this process is working successfully and no scheme has had to close as a result of the budget 2012 changes.</P>
        <P>The baseline amount of the materials/training grant remains the &euro;500 per participant announced in the Budget.  The Department Officials have discretion to make an amount of up to &euro;1,000 per participant available to schemes in respect of the training and materials grant, subject to individual schemes providing a clear and transparent demonstration of need for this level of funding.  The onus is on sponsors to make the case for the appropriate level of the grant for their individual scheme.  The level of grant sought will have to be justified by the scheme sponsor and will be subject to verification and agreement by the Department on a case by case basis.  All discussions with sponsors on these matters are being conducted in a constructive manner and all support is being provided to help the schemes to remain viable.</P>

	<P>During the period in question there were a total of six meetings of the Council for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs which is the relevant formation for the Department of Social Protection. It is the practice for the Employment and Social Affairs items to be taken on one day of this two day meeting, and Health and Consumer Affairs to be taken separately on the other. In relation to the former, the subject matter covers topics which span the interests of a number of Irish government departments &mdash; Social Protection; Enterprise, Trade and Innovation; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Education and Skills. Representation at the Council is decided on the basis of the items to be discussed, and it is often the case that Ministerial attendance from this Department is not considered necessary.</P>
        <P>During this period the Minister, along with Department Officials, attended three meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council. A further meeting was attended by a Department Official.</P>
        <P>The remaining meetings were not attended by the Minister for Social Protection, and no officials from the Department travelled to these meetings.  However, officials from the Permanent Representation (including the attach&eacute; from the Department of Social Protection) would have attended these meetings.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2012, at a time of reducing resources the Department of Education will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. The main providers of these places &mdash; Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and F&Aacute;S &mdash; have been notified of the requirement to prioritise places specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more.  </P>
        <P>There are specific programmes at every level &mdash; Springboard, the Labour Market Education and Training Fund, the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme &mdash; which are specifically for the unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed.  In addition, interim referral protocols have been circulated to local welfare offices and VECs to enable the more efficient and effective referral of unemployed people to further education programmes delivered by VECs.  These protocols will complement existing protocols between DSP offices and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>In addition my Department will support in excess of 85,000 places in 2012 across a range of job placement and work experience initiatives The Deputy will be aware that in July 2011, the Government announced the establishment of a new further education and training authority &mdash; SOLAS &mdash; which will, for the first time, have strategic responsibility for all publicly funded further education and training.  As part of <i>Pathways to Work </i>  SOLAS will have a crucial role in ensuring the referral of unemployed people to appropriate further education and training opportunities</P>
        <P>In <i>Pathways to Work</i>   the Government committed to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritise places, including in the further education and training sector   specifically for those on the Live Register for twelve months or more,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Improve data collection and impact evaluation to ensure delivery of this goal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This process is well advanced and pending the full establishment of both NEES and SOLAS as well as the completion of the amalgamation of Vocational Education Committees into Local Education and Training Boards, interim protocols have been agreed to facilitate effective collaboration.  To further enhance this process my Department also now has a representative on the management advisory committee of the Department of Education and Skills and the SOLAS Board. The Department of Education and Skills and my department will continue to work together to ensure that the objectives set out in <i>Pathways to Work</i>   are realised.</P>
        <P>Finally to ensure cross departmental support for these objectives an Inter-Departmental Programme Board has been established. The board is chaired by the Department of Social Protection and includes representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Taoiseach and the Director General of F&Aacute;S/SOLAS.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of March 2012 there were 7,040 Invalidity Pension (IP) claims registered and awaiting decision.  Approximately 280 new IP claims are received each week.  The current average time to award is 32 weeks.  However, it should be noted that this includes the time taken to decide EU and bilateral cases which have a significantly longer processing time. It is not possible at present to report separately on domestic claim processing times and on the times for EU/bilateral cases. There are 26 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff currently assigned to work on all areas of new claims processing and 2 additional full-time temporary staff allocated to assist with backlogs. The current total of 28 FTE staff includes supervisors and clerical staff.  Their duties involve deciding new domestic claims, deciding EU and bilateral claims, processing arrears, carrying out reviews on decisions as requested by customers, preparing appeals papers for submission to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and management and maintenance of the system used for claim processing. </P>
        <P>In an effort to ensure continuity of payment, priority is given to applications received from illness benefit (IB) recipients whose payment is due to expire.  Therefore applicants who are in receipt of a continuous IB payment which will not expire provided they continue to satisfy the medical criteria will take longer to process. Since the introduction of the two year expiration of IB there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in this department. A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for the IP scheme as they are not medically assessed as being permanently incapable of work.</P>
        <P>The processing time for individual IP claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria. In addition, factors outside the department&rsquo;s control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.</P>
        <P>This Department is continually reviewing its processes in an effort to improve processing times and customer service. Many improvements have already been introduced in IP section. Since June 2011 all IP claims are processed on a new IT platform under the department&rsquo;s service delivery model project. This has led to further efficiencies in processing which resulted in an increase in the number of claims processed. Most claims are now desk assessed by medical assessors to determine medical suitability. Two temporary staff have been assigned to the IP area to help to reduce the backlog and waiting time. Overtime has been made available and is utilised on a judicious basis. Business process improvement is carried out in the IP new claims area on a continuous basis. Despite these improvements it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1 July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.</P>
        <P>The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. 6,475 jobseekers have commenced their internship since 1 July 2011.  There are currently 4,522 jobseekers undertaking internship opportunities.  In addition, there are 1,989 internship opportunities available across a wide number of occupational sectors and geographic areas being hosted on the website.  All these opportunities are advertised on the JobBridge website <i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>A host organisation participating in JobBridge must be in a position to provide a substantial commitment to their intern so as to ensure the provision of a quality internship.  To this end, a clear set of rules have been developed to protect the intern and safeguard JobBridge from potential abuse.  Potential host organisations can avail of the JobBridge guidelines and full eligibility criteria available on the JobBridge website.  On 15 August 2011, these criteria were amended to include the participation of Sole Traders within the JobBridge scheme provided they have a minimum of 1 full time employee (employed for 30 hours or more per week, subject to tax and PRSI).</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).</P>
        <P>Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including illness benefit, to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  Among the issues that the Advisory Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.</P>
        <P>Self-employed individuals may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1 July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors. </P>
        <P>The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. 6,475 jobseekers have commenced their internship since 1 July 2011.  There are currently 4,522 jobseekers undertaking internship opportunities.  In addition, there are 1,989 internship opportunities available across a wide number of occupational sectors and geographic areas being hosted on the website.  All these opportunities are advertised on the JobBridge website <i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Individuals who were previously self-employed may qualify for a social welfare payment such as Jobseekers Allowance. Additionally, in cases where they do not qualify for a social welfare payment it may be possible to sign on for credits.  In such cases, these individuals would be eligible to participate on JobBridge.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>If a part-time employee is claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for a period which includes a bank holiday for which they are not entitled to a payment from their employer, then they will be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance for that day.   The determination of whether a person is entitled to payment from their employer in respect of a bank holiday is governed by the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  Under this Act, for each of the nine public holidays in a year, an employee is entitled to either a paid day off on the holiday, a paid day off within a month of the holiday, an extra day&rsquo;s annual leave, or an extra day&rsquo;s pay.  Part time employees qualify for public holidays entitlement provided they have worked at least 40 hours during the five weeks ending on the day before a public holiday.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 and 441 together. </P>
        <P>Eight retired former public servants were recruited on short term contracts in the Department of Social Protection from June 2010. These officers were employed on a part time basis as Appeals Officers, and their contracts terminated at the end of December 2011.  One of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors was retained on a temporary contract beyond retirement which ended on the 20 January 2012.  The Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Advisor was also retained beyond his retirement date of 29 February 2012 and is currently employed on a temporary contract basis.  In addition, during 2010 a retired officer was employed to chair an interdepartmental group to consider the legislation required to provide for legal recognition by the State of the acquired gender of transsexual persons.  The decision to re-employ or retain this small number of staff was taken due to their specific skills and experience, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing such skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.</P>

Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer agreed to review the case. He is satisfied that a revision of his decision is not warranted.

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Social Protection undertakes Regulatory Impact Analyses and Poverty Impact Assessments in accordance with the relevant guidelines.  Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIA) are carried out in accordance with the latest guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach, and Poverty Impact Assessments (PIA) are carried out in accordance with the latest guidelines for such assessments published by the Social Inclusion Division of the Department of Social Protection.  Poverty Impact Assessments are integrated within the Regulatory Impact Assessment process, which includes a specific requirement to examine the impacts of regulatory proposals on the socially excluded and vulnerable groups.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, which was published on 5 April 2012, contains a range of amendments to the social welfare code and to the Pensions Act 1990.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) has been undertaken on the amendments being proposed to the Pensions Act 1990 and this RIA is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at &mdash; <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/Legislation/Regulatory%20Impact%20Analysis/Documents/riapension.pdf</i>.</P>
        <P>The other measures included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 relate to certain amendments to the social welfare code arising from Budget 2012, as well as measures to control fraud and abuse of the social welfare system, to clarify the operation of the Social Insurance Fund, and to facilitate the issuing of Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSNs) and Public Services Cards.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not ordinarily undertaken on the package of measures announced in the annual Budget Day Statements.  The other social welfare measures included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 are not considered amenable to the undertaking of a RIA. With regard to Poverty Impact Assessment, the social welfare measures being provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 comprise one element of the overall Budget package of social welfare changes. That overall package of social welfare changes is itself just one element of wider Budget package of tax and welfare changes. A Poverty Impact Assessment of social welfare measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 would, in isolation, be out of balance.</P>
        <P>However, the Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, is preparing an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts on families of the Budget 2012 tax and welfare packages.  This analysis is currently being finalised and will shortly be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.  After that, I will arrange for this analysis to be published on the Department&rsquo;s website, in line with the arrangements I put in place last year.  As the potential effects of the introduction of a risk reserve on the funding position of pension schemes are not definitively quantifiable due to variable factors, the amendments contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 that are being proposed to the Pensions Act 1990 are not considered amenable to the undertaking of a Poverty Impact Assessment.</P>

        <Quest> the reason certain measures are being introduced into the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, such as the change to the basis of calculation of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from six days to five days, by way of amendment at Committee Stage; and her views on whether this means these measures will get less scrutiny in the Oireachtas. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As there is a very tight timeframe between the finalisation of the measures to be included in the Budget 2012 package, in early December 2011, and the implementation date of many of these measures in early January 2012, there was an extremely short period of time available in which to draft the Social Welfare Bill 2011 and to have this Bill enacted by the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess.  This necessarily reduced the scope to include all of the required amendments to the Social Welfare Acts arising from Budget 2012 in this Bill. Accordingly, it has been necessary to introduce a further Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, to provide for the enactment of the remaining amendments to the Social Welfare Acts arising from Budget 2012 by early May 2012 in order to comply with the implementation dates provided for in the Budget.</P>
        <P>Given the complexity of some of the Budget 2012 measures to be included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, it was not possible to include all of these items in the Bill as published.  Accordingly, a number of measures have had to be provided for by way of Committee Stage amendments, including the change to the basis of calculation of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from six days to five days.   Due to significant technical issues which arose as this measure was being designed, which related primarily to benefit duration, drafting of the necessary legislation was delayed, which prevented its inclusion in the published Bill.  However, I have arranged for detailed written briefing on the Committee Stage amendments to be issued to the various Whips in advance of the Committee Stage of the Bill and for an oral briefing to be provided to opposition spokespersons in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements &mdash; including schemes with medical criteria.  Appeals Officers are statutorily appointed by the Minister to act as administrative Tribunals and are required to exercise their functions in a quasi-judicial manner.<b></b>  There is no requirement that a person be medically qualified to be so appointed.  In this respect Appeals Officers are no different from others adjudicating in judicial and quasi-judicial capacities, including judges of the Courts. In relation to medically based schemes, the Appeals Officer adjudicates on the impact of a person&rsquo;s illness/disability on his/her capability for work, on whether a person is substantially restricted from taking up full-time employment, on whether a person requires full-time care and attention or, in the case of Domiciliary Care Allowance, whether the child being cared for requires significantly more care than other children of the same age. The fact that the Appeals Officer is not medically qualified does not in any way lessen their competence to make a determination on the basis of all evidence, medical or otherwise, put before them.  </P>

	<P>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.   In 2011, over 196,000 individuals received a back to school clothing and footwear allowance payment in respect of some 384,000 children at a cost of almost &euro;91m. A total of 18,297 families (in respect of 37,390 children) benefited from the scheme in the former Community Welfare Service, HSE West area (Galway, Roscommon and Mayo). Approximately 59% of payments were made in respect of children under 12 years of age and 41% in respect of children over 12 years of age.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 4 April 2012.   It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  When received, the appeal in question will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer for consideration and the appeal has been assigned to an Appeals Officer for consideration on whether to decide the case on a summary basis or hold an oral hearing.

	<P>A key objective of current  labour market activation policy is to prevent the drift into, and reduce, long-term unemployment. The aim is to implement an activation policy which engages with every unemployed individual and, in particular, those at risk of long-term unemployment in order to provide them with a pathway to work. This means that the State will provide supports, where appropriate, in the form of access to employment advice, job search assistance/referral, education, training and work experience.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo; approach has five strands:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed</P>
        <P LI="1">2. greater targeting of activation places and opportunities</P>
        <P LI="1">3. incentivising the take-up of opportunities</P>
        <P LI="1">4. incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed, and</P>
        <P LI="1">5. reforming institutions to deliver better services to people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This approach will help people to maintain contact with the labour market, to move back to work as opportunities emerge, and will reduce the impact of long-term unemployment on individuals and their families.</P>
        <P>The Department for Social Protection will spend approximately &euro;977 million on employment supports including Community Employment schemes in 2012, an increase from &euro;882 million in 2011. This is a substantial increase of &euro;95 million in the budget for 2012, in the context of significant fiscal consolidation, and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing its labour market activation policies.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to supporting over 85,000 beneficiaries of job placement, work experience and back to education schemes in 2012 as indicated in Table 3:</P>

A large number of these interventions will be provided by the private sector and community and voluntary organisations working with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills. Participants on programmes provided by private sector bodies who contract with the Departments may qualify for income support depending on the programme and the person&rsquo;s circumstances.  The targets set out in Pathways to work are being monitored on an ongoing basis. To date progress has been satisfactory and I am satisfied that the level of training and education provision in 2012 is adequate in the context of current budgetary resources.</P>

In addition the Fairs seek to promote employment opportunities in the Single European Labour Market.</P>
        <P>The Fairs are organised with relevant stakeholders as partners. Key to their success has been the close co-operation with the Chambers of Commerce and the statutory and voluntary sectors operating at local level. The non-staff costs of these events are fully funded by the European Commission and the Department has sought funding from the European Commission to conduct at least one event in each D.S.P. region over the next 12 months. It should be noted that a very successful event was held in Carlow last September and consideration is being given to holding a Fair in Wicklow in 2012.  In general the location of each event depends on the availability and numbers of jobs which Employers have and the co-operation of relevant stakeholders. The population and labour force base is also a factor.</P>
        <P>Youth@Work is a European Commission organised and delivered programme. This programme will end this month and no further events will take place anywhere in Europe.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to   provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The maximum participation limits for CE are 3 years in total for those under 55 years of age, and 6 years in total for those of 55 to 65 years of age. Off-shore islander clients are exempt from CE participation caps.</P>
        <P>Persons in receipt of one of the four qualifying disability related social welfare payments are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., 4 years for those under 55 and 7 years for those of 55 to 65. This additional year for such persons is in recognition of the extra demands and effort required to participate in the programme.</P>
        <P>The length of time a person can remain on CE is dictated by a number of factors (as governed by the eligibility rules of CE):</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Age of the person.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Department of Social Protection (DSP ) payment and duration.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Previous participation on CE since April 2000.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether they are considered job-ready.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Budgetary limitations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The overall duration limits are strictly enforced to maximize the number of places available for potential clients. There are no plans to extend the time limits on CE.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis   on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups which need access to CE &mdash; lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons. The Department is at all times obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 15 October 2011.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 16 January 2012 and the appeal has been assigned to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</P>

	<P>The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2001-2016 (NAPinclusion) identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty. My Department has recently completed the third annual report on social inclusion. This report will outline progress in implementing the NAPinclusion over the two-year period from January 2009 to December 2010.  The report is currently being prepared for publication and will be made publically available as soon as possible. My Department also convened the annual Social Inclusion Forum to consult with all relevant stakeholders on social inclusion issues and progress in NAPinclusion.</P>
        <P>NAPinclusion sets outs the national poverty target to reduce the number of people experiencing poverty.  The latest data on consistent poverty from the Central Statistics Office relates to 2010, when the rate of consistent poverty was 6.2 per cent.  According to the CSO, this &lsquo;represents no statistically significant change on the 2009 figure of 5.5 per cent&rsquo;. By comparison, the 2005 baseline figure for the national poverty target was 7 per cent.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government provides that the elimination of poverty is a key objective of this Government.  Given the challenging economic and fiscal context, the Government has undertaken a comprehensive review of the national poverty target in order to ensure that it remains appropriate and achievable.  I expect the review of the national poverty target to be finalised shortly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A rapid return to sustainable economic growth and the development of inclusive labour market policies are crucial to reduce poverty and social exclusion. The Government recently publish its policy statement on labour market activation called <i>Pathways to Work</i>. The approach is to ensure that as many new jobs opportunities as possible filled by those on the Live Register, so that unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed, can benefit from an improvement in economic conditions. My Department will be playing a key role in this regard through the establishment of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes and people living on social welfare payments.  </P>
        <P>I am fully satisfied that MABS has sufficient resources to assist and support its clients. This is borne out by the data which show that the 54 MABS companies, employing some 277 money advice staff, dealt with an additional 306 new clients between Q4 2010 and Q4 2011, During the same period, the number of helpline calls decreased by 1,131, a fall of almost 20%.  On an annual basis, the total number of clients was 21,653 in 2010 compared to 22,462 in 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Citizens Information Board compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis. Based on the latest information available, at the end of February 2012, the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 3.6 weeks.  This is the average nationally and obviously, there are fluctuations between offices.  Information and statistics in relation to the level of services provided by MABS are available on<i> www.mabs.ie</i></P>
        <P>During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and, if appropriate, they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.</P>
        <P>In December 2011 sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the retention of 12 temporary posts within the MABS network for a further two year period.  I am satisfied that this additional resource ensures that MABS can continue to provide a high quality service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions to prevent the introduction or escape and spread of invasive alien species in Ireland.  The introduction or escape of certain fish species into watercourses has the potential to cause serious ecological damage to those watercourses, and when alien species become established it is likely to be extremely costly or indeed impossible to eradicate them. This is why it is necessary to make such provisions in law.</P>
        <P>The above Regulations allow for the granting of licences for sale of certain species.   Given the diversity of circumstances that may arise, each application for a licence will need to be individually considered by my Department, taking account of the requirements of the Habitats Directive, in particular Article 22(b) of that Directive, and best scientific advice.</P>
        <P>Regulation 50 of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 is not yet in effect.  Before this regulation is commenced, my Department will examine, with relevant experts, whether a significant threat is posed by Koi carp, as opposed to the common variety of carp.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The roll out of 4G networks is subject to the development of the necessary equipment standards and specifications, which is ongoing at this time.  For example, testing and trials are currently underway for Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-Advanced) which is one of the technologies expected to be able to meet international requirements for 4G.  No State or network operator has yet rolled out a completed national 4G network.  In addition, in Ireland, the provision of any wireless communications service, including 4G services, is subject to the award of the appropriate radio spectrum rights by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). </P>
        <P>ComReg has recently published its decision for the auction of a number of individual rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz radio spectrum bands.  This auction will offer spectrum rights of use for the period 2013 to 2030.  The spectrum rights of use being auctioned, in particular the 800 MHz and 900 MHz spectrum bands, are highly suitable for advanced mobile services, including 4G services, due to their excellent propagation properties which give high quality and wide area coverage.  ComReg is independent in the exercise of this function.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the independence of ComReg in this matter, the requirement to secure spectrum rights to operate any publicly accessible wireless network and the publicly notified planned auction of spectrum rights, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter at this time.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any statute which defines turf as an agricultural product.</P>
        <P>The Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1998 provide for the statutory role and functions of Bord na M&oacute;na plc.  Section 17(1)(b) of the 1946 Turf Development Act 1946 assigns to Bord na M&oacute;na the function of fostering the production and use of turf and turf products.</P>
        <P>Given the finite nature of the turf resources available to it, Bord na M&oacute;na has adopted the &lsquo;A New Contract with Nature&rsquo; strategy which seeks to<b> </b>transform the Group into a sustainable provider of goods and services in the electricity, horticulture, heat, feedstock, clean air and clean water and waste management markets.</P>
        <P>A key element of this strategy involves securing appropriate and sustainable uses of Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s peatlands, which to date have been primarily used for peat harvesting for energy and for horticulture growing media.</P>
        <P>Over one-fifth of such landholdings are already committed to future uses that include forestry, tourism and amenity, industry and infrastructure, aggregate production, water storage and wind energy. In addition, some peatlands have been conserved for their high biodiversity value.</P>

        <Quest> the implications of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 on oil and gas development in the event of a commercial extraction of oil or gas project being developed that was not State petroleum prior to the enactment of the 1960 Act, which provides that compensation is payable by him and outline its implications to the taxpayer; if he will further outline if the Kinsale gas field was part of this programme; and the cost to the State. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 468 and 471 together.  </P>
        <P>The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 provides that the property in all petroleum shall vest in the State.  The Act also provides for a compensation mechanism for persons who immediately before the passing of that Act were entitled to an estate in minerals that included petroleum.  The compensation provisions in the Act, which would only apply in circumstances where a commercial discovery had been made and petroleum was being extracted, set out the process through which a person can establish their right to compensation.  Payment of compensation would reduce the financial return to the State from a producing field.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department does not have a statutory role in relation to the registration of property rights and accordingly does not have details of the property rights held by private individuals or corporate bodies.</P>
        <P>The compensation provisions set out at Chapter VI (Sections 33 to 39) of the 1960 Act are not of relevance in the case of the Kinsale area gas fields as they do not apply to offshore areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 and 470 together. </P>
        <P>The agreement between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Ambassador Irish Oil Ltd. was made over half a century ago and gave the company an exploration licence for 20 years from 29th   March 1960.  The area licensed to the company was the whole onshore area of the Republic of Ireland and any seas under Irish jurisdiction.  The licence was subject to the performance of a work programme and the surrender of 25% of the original acreage every five years.  The extensive exploration rights conferred by that agreement have long since expired, with the only areas remaining under licence being the producing fields in the Kinsale area.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, legislation applying to petroleum exploration was contained in the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918 and the Minerals Development Act, 1940.  Since the enactment of the 1960 Act, the terms applying to oil and gas exploration have been amended on a number of occasions, the most recent changes being in 2007.</P>

This support scheme was made up of two payments &mdash; a 9 cent payment per kilowatt exported from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland) and a 10 cent payment per kilowatt exported from ESB Networks.  This amounted to a total of 19 cent that a domestic customer could potentially obtain per kilowatt exported to the grid. </P>
        <P>Electric Ireland has decided to extend their 9 cent per kilowatt exported for domestic consumers to end 2012.  The terms and conditions of the Electric Ireland scheme are available on the Electric Ireland website.  ESB Networks, since February 2012 no longer offer 10c per kilowatt exported.  This was a commercial decision taken by ESB Networks.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s (SEAI) small- and micro-scale generation pilot field trial was designed to evaluate the operational performance of a range of renewable generation technologies including wind, solar photovoltaic and hydro up to a nominal capacity limit of 50 kW.  The performance of the pilot generators is being monitored by SEAI over an 18 month period. SEAI have indicated that a final report on the 18 month pilot will be forwarded to my Department in the near future.</P>
        <P>SEAI&rsquo;s initial analysis on feed-in-tariff options for microgeneration, in the Irish context, is being updated in light of developments and in particular the speed at which technology costs such as for photovoltaic have fallen globally in the last 18 months.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government states that a feed-in tariff will be provided for micro-generators wishing to produce electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and that they will be facilitated to sell surplus electricity to the grid while the tariff should not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.  Take up on the ESB scheme was quite low and that scheme offered a price that was over twice the wholesale price of electricity.  My Department and the SEAI are finalising analysis on the most cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the micro-generation sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Government Decision was made at the end of May last year to draft a new Consumer and Competition Bill.  Part of that decision involved giving effect in legislation to the recommendations of the Report of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers, and to transfer responsibility for public interest considerations from the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to my Department.  A series of discussions were held at Ministerial and official level on this subject, both before and after the Government Decision, and contacts are ongoing on the matter. </P>
        <P>Primary responsibility for promulgating the Consumer and Competition Bill 2012 rests with my colleague, Mr. Richard Bruton TD, the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand that the Consumer and Competition Bill 2012 is one of a number of Government Bills currently being drafted, and that it is likely to be later in the year before a draft Bill is published and brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The critical role of the media in our democracy, and the potentially harmful effects of an over concentration of media ownership, means that this issue is a vitally important one.  The Government remains committed to implementing a set of robust measures that allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases, and to do so as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered nationally through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.</P>
        <P>2012 marks a shift in emphasis on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy.  The Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy has established subgroups to finalise work on the roll out of the Strategy, including finalisation of revised eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme.  Heretofore, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.</P>
        <P>The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority.  Such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This priority focus will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.  All applicants since the end of 2011 have been informed that there will be a change in eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The network of 25 CBOs is delivering on the ground on an ongoing basis.  Grant agreements are pending with two additional CBOs which are expected to issue shortly.  Pending the introduction of the change to the eligibility criteria, energy efficiency upgrades continue to be provided to households on the waiting list.</P>
        <P>SEAI advises that the CBO referred to has been in contact to advise they have completed most of the homes on their list.  On foot of this information the SEAI allocated additional homes from the contractor list to CBOs, including the CBO referred to.  The CBO was offered all homes in the county in which they operate and selected the homes closest to their base of operation.  The homes allocated were completed last week.  It is worth noting that the CBO has been working continuously since they were put in contract with the SEAI.  CBOs are already in a position to deliver from their own lists and I can confirm that there has been no delay with the delivery of Better Energy: Warmer Homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 15 December 2011, I published the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill.   In developing this Bill I have had particular regard to recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report, published in March 2011.  The Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and is currently before the D&aacute;il at second stage.  It will, when enacted, fundamentally change the way politics is funded and conducted in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that political parties will be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.  This provision will address the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation that all income of political parties be disclosed.  It will go beyond this recommendation by providing that the expenditure of parties is also reported and open to public scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The Tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be disclosed.  The Bill provides that the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission will fall from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.  The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or elected representative is to be reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600.  There is provision for a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns.  In addition the Bill provides for a reduction in the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies, in reporting donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission, from a figure of &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.</P>
        <P>The Moriarty Tribunal Report noted that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Oireachtas, and for public debate and consideration, having regard to constitutional issues that might arise and to the national financial exigencies.  With reference to this comment in the Tribunal Report, a noteworthy provision in the Bill is the introduction of a ban on the acceptance of donations over &euro;200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  Such donations will also need to be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body, or by its trustees.</P>
        <P>As a further reforming measure, the Bill provides that the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual is being reduced from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  This &euro;1,000 limit will apply in respect of donations to a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, as well as a candidate at a Presidential, D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or local election.</P>
        <P>The maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party is being reduced to &euro;2,500.  The current figure is &euro;6,348.69.</P>
        <P>This Bill will significantly enhance the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland, issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.</P>

	<P>It is estimated that the annual loss arising from vehicle owners declaring their vehicles off the road is in the region of &euro;84m.</P>
        <P>Currently, owners declare vehicles off the road for the purposes of motor tax after the fact, which is effectively unverifiable and open to abuse.  I intend to provide that drivers will be able to declare their intention to keep their vehicle off-the-road in advance, so that if a vehicle is not to be used on a public road for a number of months, the owner will be able to inform the relevant authorities before taking the car off the road rather than afterwards, and so avoid a liability for motor tax.  The General Scheme of a Bill to tighten the procedures is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department and I expect to bring it to Cabinet next month.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482, 509, 510, 512, 515, 531 to 538, inclusive, and 546 together.</P>
        <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a proposal to establish Irish Water, a State-owned water company that will take over the water investment and maintenance programmes of the 34 city and county councils who act as water services authorities.</P>
        <P>The Programme of Financial Support for Ireland with the EU/IMF/ECB also requires the preparation of proposals for implementation of the recommendations of an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water service provision to a water utility and that water charges would be introduced.</P>
        <P>A team led by PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed through an open competition to conduct the independent assessment.  The full cost of the study is &euro;107,800 excluding VAT.  The first part of this study, The <i>Irish Water: Phase 1 Report</i>, was published in January 2012 together with a Departmental position paper setting out the overall approach to reforms in the water sector; copies are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These publications were part of a consultation process to inform the implementation phase.  A sum of &euro;49,000 of the consultancy fee (excluding VAT) was paid in 2011 and the balance is due to be paid during 2012.</P>
        <P>The independent assessment concluded, based on an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, international experience and stakeholder soundings, that a public utility offers the best opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water services delivery, provide access to new funding sources, and improve strategic planning and accountability.  No other model examined by the consultants would offer the same advantages.</P>
        <P>The independent assessment, while recognising that there were potential advantages to leveraging the structure, expertise and governance of an existing State agency in the establishment of Irish Water, also foresaw certain issues which would have to be satisfactorily addressed in such circumstances, and, on balance, recommended that Irish Water should be established as a new entity.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations in the independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  The Government also decided that the issues raised in regard to whether Irish Water should be established as a new State Agency or whether the role of Irish Water should be assigned to an existing State Agency should be analysed further with a view to ensuring that existing resources and capabilities in the State sector were used to best effect.  This approach is also in line with Government plans to support economic growth by eliminating waste and duplication in public spending through rationalising state agencies.</P>
        <P>The further analysis was undertaken by a team comprising the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and NewERA, in consultation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The process involved an assessment of the capacity and capabilities of a number of State agencies from amongst those identified in the independent assessment as having the potential to incorporate a new water utility.  It was not a tendering process culminating in the award of a contract.  The process involved the making of detailed submissions and presentations by Bord na M&oacute;na and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) based on identified capabilities required for the establishment and operation of Irish Water.</P>
        <P>The outcome of this analysis is that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group.  This was agreed by Government at its meeting on 17 April 2012.  Irish Water will be a public utility, wholly owned by the State.  The water service will remain in public ownership as is the case in most countries in Europe and further afield.</P>
        <P>BGE has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  The skills within the Bord G&aacute;is Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.</P>
        <P>The submissions made by both BGE and Bord na M&oacute;na are confidential and commercially sensitive and their publication, in part or in full, would require the prior approval of the companies concerned.</P>
        <P>The initial transition strategy for the establishment of Irish Water as a public utility as recommended in the independent assessment envisages a staged approach involving local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water for a period with Irish Water taking over their operations on a phased basis from January 2015, and the full transfer of operations being completed by end 2017, at the earliest.  An implementation strategy for Irish Water is now being developed to give further effect to the Government decision of 17 April.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitment under the Programme for Government and the EU/IMF Agreement in relation to State assets, the Government has decided to sell Bord Gais Energy, which is a separate business unit of the BGE group dealing with electricity and gas supply as well as power generation.  The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining BGE&rsquo;s gas networks and interconnectors in State ownership.  I am confident that Bord Gais will continue to contribute to achieving key Government and national objectives in its ongoing management of the strategic gas infrastructure as well as the sale of the Bord Gais Energy business and the establishment of the new Irish water utility.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.</P>
        <P>The local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Managers Association (CCMA) and is representative of the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.  One of the conditions of the plan, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.    The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is in the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>
        <P>In terms of comparison to other schemes of mortgage protection, it is important to note that it covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available.  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.  In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee were able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 544 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the national water conservation programme was rolled out in 2003, over &euro;208 million has been specifically invested in water conservation measures by my Department.  In addition, local authorities fund active leakage control, detection and repair from their own operational budgets.  Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in place the water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  Most local authorities have now prepared water mains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years.  The primary objective of this programme of work is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water.</P>
        <P>Progress is monitored on an annual basis through the local authority service indicators and through the collection of data from local authorities.  The most recent published comparative figures for unaccounted for water in each county are set out in the report <i>Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2010</i> which was published by the Local Government Management Services Board in December 2011, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The OECD (2010) has concluded that water metering is unequivocally the fairest way to charge for domestic water usage.  The introduction of water meters encourages households to reduce consumption, use water efficiently and to fix leaks where these are identified.  The installation of water meters will encourage households to conserve water and will ensure that customer side leaks can be identified and fixed.  Metering will, therefore, achieve significant reductions in the volumes of water that are required to be produced and treated every day and will lead to savings in the operational costs of delivering water services and in deferred capital expenditure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed water metering programme will be complemented by a continuing programme of investment in water mains rehabilitation and replacement.  My Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013 places a high priority on water conservation.  In the year to end September 2011, some 200 km of public water supply pipes had been replaced or rehabilitated under this programme.  Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  Over time, this investment coupled with ongoing active leakage control should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and improve service to customers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489, 498, 508, 511, 513, 539 and 542 together.</P>
        <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.  In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In keeping with international practice regarding water metering, the meters will be installed at the boundary of the property, most typically on the footpath at the front of a house.  Households will not be charged an upfront charge for the water meter.  However, similar to other utilities and the approach adopted in the metering of non domestic customers, it is likely that there will be a charge included in bills to cover the cost of the meter and its installation metering programme.  The level of charges, including any charges relating to meter installation and maintenance, will be determined as part of the regulatory process.</P>
        <P>Insofar as properties metered under the non domestic metering programme are concerned, such properties were not charged an upfront installation fee and their water bills include a standing charge which relates to the cost of the water meter.  It will be a matter for Irish Water to determine how it will integrate any existing metered properties into its national system.</P>

        <Quest> if he has encouraged all local authorities to exercise restraint in setting of commercial rates for 2012; the form that encouragement took; the response he received; if not completed, when it will be done; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. </P>
        <P>Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities.  Rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have, however, been asked by my Department, by way of a circular letter, to exercise restraint in setting their 2012 ARVs. Across the 88 rating local authorities, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.</P>
        <P>I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495, 500, 518 to 522, inclusive, and 530 together. </P>
        <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service, a system otherwise known as &lsquo;franchise-bidding.&rsquo;</P>
        <P>A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011.  A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests, including the Competition Authority.  A consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed.  All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising a regulatory impact analysis to examine the costs, benefits and other impacts of options for change, and to inform how best to regulate the household waste collection market.  The analysis has been informed by the outcomes of the public consultation process and by information subsequently provided by consultees, including relevant economic information.  I intend to publish the regulatory impact analysis concerning the regulation of household waste collection subsequent to Government&rsquo;s consideration of the issues.</P>
        <P>Household waste collection is a service of critical importance to every household in the country.  My intention is to ensure that household waste collection is regulated so that, as a society, our collective welfare is maximised.  I wish to see competitive, high quality, and efficient services provided to households in all areas of the country, and I wish to see the best possible environmental outcomes achieved.</P>
        <P>My approach to waste policy is not dictated by any one facility or any one technology.  Queries in relation to the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Poolbeg and related contractual issues are a matter for the parties to the contract.</P>
        <P>I expect to be in a position to finalise proposals for Government in relation to household waste collection in the coming weeks.  All policy proposals, including franchise-bidding will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives, including our obligations under the Landfill Directive and the Waste Framework Directive, the impact on consumers and the industry of potential changes to market structures, competition issues and the matter of waivers for low income households.</P>

	<P>Under the Public Safety Initiative my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;2.79 million to 21 local authorities from the funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues in 2011.  The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  A provision of &euro;2m has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.  To date, a total amount of &euro;1.54 million has been drawn down by local authorities.  Requests for funding relating to Category 4 unfinished housing developments (i.e. those developments in which serious public safety concerns exist and the responsible party cannot be pursued in the short term) are made to my Department by local authorities.  My Department&rsquo;s Housing Inspectorate examine these applications and approve the allocation of funds.  When the works have been carried out to a satisfactory degree, the local authorities then submit invoices to the Planning and Housing Policy Section of my Department.</P>
        <P>Verification of the satisfactory completion of such works is a matter for the individual local authority concerned, and my Department has no remit in this regard.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on: clear legal standards as set out in the Building Regulations; detailed Technical Guidance Documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice; the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers/builders; a statutory responsibility for professionals who are engaged by developers to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards; and the responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the 37 local building control authorities.</P>
        <P>Where a contract exists between the owner of a building (including a local authority in the case of certain publicly owned buildings) and the relevant builder/developer enforcement may also be a civil matter.</P>
        <P>Local authorities already have extensive powers under the Building Control Acts which they can use to enforce compliance with the Building Regulations.  These include the powers to scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress; to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance; to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements; and to seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.</P>
        <P>While a robust system of building control exists, there are steps that can and must be taken to strengthen the system.  I have recently released, for public consultation, proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which will provide for (a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met; and (b) the lodgement of drawings, at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P>The closing date for submissions in relation to the proposed regulations is 24 May 2012.</P>
        <P>Mandatory certification and lodgement of drawings are key reforms which will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime in 2012.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 184 of 28 March 2012. Following a challenge to the State&rsquo;s ownership of the foreshore concerned, this application was first referred to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office for legal advice in February 2011.  Since that date, a number of exchanges of information have been made between my Department, the applicants and that office in an effort to resolve the ownership question.  Final advice from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is awaited.</P>
        <P>A meeting with the applicant in advance of the resolution of the ownership question and my determination of the application for a foreshore licence would not be appropriate. However, I can confirm that my Department has been in direct contact with Rosscarbery Rowing Club recently in an effort to progress the public consultation phase of the application without prejudice to the final outcome on the ownership of the foreshore concerned.</P>

	<P>The Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/IMF and ECB commits Ireland to introducing water charges for households.  The objective of the water metering programme is to install water meters in households connected to the public mains and move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance.  The metering programme will commence prior to the end of 2012.  I expect that the Regulator will address affordability issues, including in respect of persons with medical conditions, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Social Protection in the context of developing a water pricing framework.  </P>

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.

	<P>The moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service was introduced in March 2009 in response to the financial crisis. My Department operates a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities, and any exceptions to the moratorium in local authorities require sanction from my Department.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for City and County Managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained.</P>
        <P>My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services, and economic issues are given precedence.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with Sligo County Council in relation to the Council&rsquo;s overall staffing requirements and I understand that the post mentioned is being considered as part of that process.</P>

	<P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, launched by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</P>
        <P>This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</P>
        <P>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</P>
        <P>Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 540 and 541 together.  </P>
        <P>The Government has decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to customers; the regulator will be given appropriate powers in this regard.  My Department is working with the CER on the development of the regulatory framework for the water sector and legislation is being prepared to provide the Commission with the necessary powers to fulfil its new role.  The first phase of the independent assessment, the Irish Water: Phase 1 Report, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, and which issued as part of a public consultation process on the proposed water reforms earlier this year, envisaged that the National Consumer Agency (NCA) could have a role in relation to customer complaints and that the respective roles of CER and the NCA in this regard should be clarified during the implementation planning phase. The NCA made a submission as part of the consultation process and the submission and the recommendation in the independent assessment will be given further consideration by my Department in consultation with the NCA, and the CER, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>Irish Water will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills.  For example, a wide range of flexible payment options are available for the other utility services and it is expected that these will be replicated for water services.  It would, also be expected that Irish Water would pursue payment from customers who refuse to pay even when they have the financial capacity to pay the bill, and a range of options will also be put in place to this end, as is normal practice with other utility service providers.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 553 together. </P>
        <P>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question the Moriarty Tribunal made a number of observations and recommendations in relation to Financial Regulation.</P>
        <P>The report suggests that failures in regulation in the period concerned were related more to the attitude of the Regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers or the overall system then in place. This accords with the extensive analysis of Professor Honohan which concluded that there needed to be &ldquo;a greater degree of intrusiveness and assertiveness on the part of regulators&rdquo;.  Recent reforms of the Central Bank have taken this point through new appointments at top level in the Bank; increased staffing and skills and a programme of legislative reform.</P>
        <P><i>Findings of the Report</i></P>
        <P>The Moriarty Report made the following observations and recommendations in respect of financial regulation:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The conduct of Guinness and Mahon Bank which gave rise to elements of the report (i.e. the operation of a tax avoidance scheme) failed to be regulated by the Central Bank under the last system but one (whereby there was a single Central Bank with regulatory functions). Since then the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) was established in 2003 and abolished in 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Failures in regulation were related more to the attitude of the regulator towards the regulated than any inadequacy in regulatory powers.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The future vigilance of the regulator can best be ensured by the heightened vigilance of public representatives.</P>
        <P>These findings are consistent with those of others, such as Professor Honohan in his report on financial regulation and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P><i>Reforms of the Central Bank:</i></P>
        <P>Significant changes have recently been made to the structure governing financial regulation and oversight of the Central Bank. These matters were included in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which was a constituent part of the CBFSAI, was dissolved, the posts of Chief Executive of the Regulatory Authority and Consumer Director were abolished. Two new posts &mdash; Head of Financial Regulation and Head of Central Banking &mdash; were created.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Bank is now a single fully-integrated structure with a unitary Board, the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the stability of the financial system overall, for prudential regulation of financial institutions and for the protection of consumer interests. The Governor remains solely responsible for European System of Central Banks (ESCB) related functions.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The Bank&rsquo;s statutory function of promoting the development within the State of the financial services industry was removed.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Annual Performance Statements on regulatory performance prepared by the Bank, presented to the Minister for Finance and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  (Note: this will be in addition to the Bank&rsquo;s Strategy Statement which is to be prepared at least every three years and its Annual Report and Accounts).  A committee of the Oireachtas may call the Governor and/or the Heads of Functions to be examined on the Performance Statement.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Regular international peer reviews of regulatory performance with the report of same forming part of the Performance Statement for the relevant year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the appointment of Professor Honohan as Governor and Mr. Elderfield as Head of Financial Regulation marked a significant change in attitude and approach. Mr. Elderfield is undertaking a very significant programme to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s regulatory capacity which has included the appointment of new staff at all levels within the organisation.</P>
        <P><i>Enhancing the Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central Bank:</i></P>
        <P>The Supervisory and Enforcement powers of the Central bank are due be strengthened via the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. The Bill responds to the regulatory failures of the financial crisis. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. It also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and will underpin the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.</P>
        <P>The Bill was published in July 2011 (Government Decision S180/20/10/1435 of 26 July 2011 refers) in accordance with the structural benchmark under the EU-IMF Programme.  The Bill completed Second Stage in October 2011 and is anticipated that it will go to Committee Stage shortly.</P>
        <P><i>Parliamentary Oversight:</i></P>
        <P>The report suggested that the necessary change of attitude by regulators to bring about increased vigilance &ldquo;can probably best be encouraged by increased vigilance on the part of elected representatives.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 enhances accountability and oversight mechanisms relating to the governance of the Bank and its regulatory performance.  A Committee of the Oireachtas will receive an annual Regulatory Performance Statement &mdash; a new mechanism to increase accountability in respect of regulatory obligations.  This is in addition to more general provisions already in the Central Bank Act 1942 relating to the appearances of the Governor and certain office holders before Oireachtas Committees.  It is also consistent with the recommendations of the C&amp;AG in his special report on the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P><i>Revenue Matters:</i></P>
        <P><i>Proposal 1:  Proceedings involving civil and criminal aspects</i></P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they have put administrative arrangements in place which are designed to enable the civil and criminal aspects of appropriate cases to be managed separately when required.</P>
        <P><i>Proposal 2: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</i></P>
        <P>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</P>
        <P><i>Proposal 3: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</i></P>
        <P>In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</P>
        <P>A further recommendation related to the transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further. The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.</P>

As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby any person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling house. This scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority. Since it was introduced in 1978, over 80,000 applicants have availed of the scheme to acquire the freehold title to their property.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 provides for the structural separation of alcohol from other goods in supermarkets, convenience stores and similar outlets. However, during the period leading up to enactment of the 2008 Act, bodies representing the mixed trading sector proposed implementation of a voluntary code of practice with an independent audit and oversight mechanism as an alternative to section 9. A code of practice was subsequently drawn up and agreed between the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the mixed trading sector.</P>
        <P>A new body &mdash; Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Ltd (RRAI) &mdash; was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation of the Code and Mr. Padraic While was appointed as independent Chairperson of RRAI.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of Mr. White&rsquo;s third Compliance Report on the RRAI Code of Practice on the Display and Sale of Alcohol in Mixed Trading Premises in October last, I launched a public consultation process inviting views on the Report and, more generally, on the voluntary approach to implementing structural separation of alcohol products in such premises. I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for proposals relating to future arrangements for the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Funding for services supporting victims of crime is provided through the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  Since its inception in 2005, the Commission has allocated &euro;409,600 in funding to the Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS).  The Irish Tourist Assistance Service offers immediate support and assistance to tourist victims of crime while visiting Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are no official statistics available in relation to the number of visitors to this country who were victims of crime.  However, I understand that since its inception in 1994, that ITAS has assisted over 11,000 tourists. The majority of these tourists continued their holiday after ITAS intervention.  According to ITAS&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2011, they assisted 251 visitors who were victims of crime in Ireland in 2011.  65% of the crimes committed against these visitors were theft against the person, 6% were burglary and 21% were theft from either private or hired cars, giving a total of 92% for theft and burglary offences.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter for me to offer an interpretation of the law; particularly as it would apply in a specific case.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that under section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006, a person who refuses or fails to comply with a requirement made at a mandatory alcohol testing checkpoint to provide a breath specimen is guilty of an offence, unless they have a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to do so.  In such instances where a reasonable excuse is provided, it falls upon the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to form an opinion whether or not alcohol has been consumed. If the member forms the opinion that alcohol has been consumed he/she will arrest that person and bring the person to a Garda station where they will be required to provide a specimen of blood or urine.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.  The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.  The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.  I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.   <b></b></P>

	<P>The Programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges&rdquo; and this is taking place in the form of the Judicial Council Bill for which a General Scheme had been published in 2010. As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  In November of 2011, the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, announced that the judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Bill and I have very much welcomed this forward-looking initiative. Under the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme announced by the Chief Whip on 17 April 2012 the Judicial Council Bill is in the course of being drafted with a view to being published late in 2012. </P>

	<P>The Irish Prison Service has developed and is implementing an Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) initiative within the prison system.  ISM involves a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a prisoner-centred multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.  Newly committed prisoners with a sentence of greater than one year are eligible to take part in ISM. If they agree to participate, a First Contact Assessment interview takes place.  This First Contact Assessment identifies the needs of the prisoner in several areas such as accommodation, education and offending behaviour.  Referrals are made on foot of this assessment to services within the prison such as Education or Work and Training and outside agencies providing an in-reach service.  These services and agencies carry out their own assessment of the prisoner and feed their recommended actions back to the ISM Co-ordinator. </P>
        <P>The various actions recommended are compiled into a Personal Integration Plan (PIP).  This is a plan of actions for the prisoner to complete during his/her time in prison.  The PIP will be reviewed regularly depending on the length of the sentence.  Approximately 9 months prior to the release of the prisoner, a Community Integration Plan (CIP) will be developed.  This sets out a plan for the prisoner to prepare for his/her release.  Important issues such as accommodation, employment or education are addressed to help the prisoner resettle into the community on release and reduce the risk of re-offending.</P>
        <P>There are currently seven acting full time ISM Co-ordinators supporting the process in a number of prisons.  It is envisaged, through staffing redeployments under the Transformation process, that dedicated ISM Co-ordinators will be assigned to all prisons in the coming months which will enhance the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitate the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that Merchants Quay Ireland are engaged on a contract for service basis to provide addiction counselling services to the Irish Prison Service.  There are also similar contractual arrangements in place for the provision of pharmacy services to all prisons.  The Irish Prison Service directly employs 1 pharmacist, 3 full-time and 15 part-time doctors. In relation to other practitioners, which I understand from the Deputy&rsquo;s question to be in the healthcare area, the Irish Prison Service employs 18 full-time and 2 part-time psychologists as well as 134.5 nursing staff.   To further support the provision of healthcare to the prisoner population, the services of 4.5 locum doctors and 12 agency nurses are engaged.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the recruitment of 2 doctors to fill existing vacancies in the Irish Prison Service. However, the overall staffing level in the public service is determined within the context of the moratorium on staffing levels with particular regard to the Employment Control Frameworks currently in place.  Meeting those targets will require continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment with exceptions being limited only to essential posts which are subject to the prior approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="0"><i>Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th February, 2002, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations have been received from and on behalf of the person concerned.</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><i>The person concerned applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a parent of an Irish born citizen child, born before 1st January, 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced by the then Minister on 15th January, 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  His application was refused as he did not meet the Scheme&rsquo;s good character requirements. He was notified of this decision by letter dated 8th September, 2005.</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><i>By letter dated 26th January, 2010, the person concerned was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><i>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</i></P>

All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. In advance of a final decision being made, the case of the person concerned will be examined to determine what, if any, impact the European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case may have on his case.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</i></P>

        <P>The Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme were both formally launched on 13 March 2012. For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I set out below my press release.</P>

Applications with regard to both programmes are being accepted since 15 April 2012. In addition INIS has provided an e-mail facility whereby interested parties or their representatives can submit queries in relation to both schemes.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Press Release</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Formal Launch of New Programmes for Investors and Entrepreneurs 13 March 2012</i></P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Mr Alan Shatter TD, today formally announced the date of commencement of the two new immigration programmes aimed at stimulating investment and job creation in Ireland. The new initiatives, which were approved by Government in January, will be known as:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">1) <i>The Immigrant Investor Programme</i> 2) <i>The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Since the initial outline of the programmes, the Minister&rsquo;s officials have been putting in place the implementation arrangements with the relevant State agencies.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The programmes will be open for applications from 15 April. Application forms will be available for download from 30 March together with detailed guidelines on the application process, including a comprehensive collection of &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Announcing the commencement date of the programmes Minister Shatter said <i>&ldquo;These programmes are all about investment and job creation. Everyone knows that the economic situation is challenging but sometimes that can be a catalyst for new ideas and I am happy that my Department, even though it does not have an overt economic remit, can play its part&rdquo;</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Minister went on to say <i>&ldquo;Ireland still has a bright future and migrant entrepreneurs and investors can play an important role in that future. We are now giving them the opportunity to do just that&rdquo;</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Minister then outlined the details of the programmes.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">1. <i>Immigrant Investor Programme</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Approved participants in the Immigrant Investor Programme and their immediate family members will be granted rights of residence in Ireland. This will allow them to enter the State on multi-entry visas and to remain here for a defined period but with the possibility of ongoing renewal. The intention is that the person involved would over time establish a permanent relationship with Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Types of Investment:</i> First of all it should be said that each application will be examined on its merits in a qualitative examination by an interdepartmental committee. The investment has to be good for Ireland, good for jobs and in the public interest, the funds invested have to be legally acquired and owned by the investor (i.e. not borrowed). The person has to be of good character.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In order to be considered for the programme the investor must make an investment of the following type:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>a</i>) A once off <i>endowment of a minimum of &euro;500,000 to a public project</i> benefiting the arts, sports, health, culture or education.</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>Note: The idea is that the person would put significant funds into something tangible and to the benefit of the public. It is not a question of merely contributing to State funds or displacing state investment.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><i>b</i>) A minimum <i>&euro;1,000,000 aggregate investment into new or existing Irish businesses for a minimum of three years</i>. Funding by the investor through the intermediary of a venture capital fund will be considered provided that it can be demonstrated that the net effect is at least equivalent to that of a direct investment.</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>Note: The investment must contribute to creating or saving jobs. Merely purchasing an asset for speculative purposes would not qualify. A shareholding in an Irish publicly traded company could be considered in exceptional circumstances but a simple share purchase on the open market would not meet the requirements of the scheme.</i></P>
        <P LI="2"><i>c</i>) minimum <i>&euro;2,000,000 investment in a special low interest 5 year immigrant investor bond.</i> There will be one interest payment of 5.1% at the end of the 5 year investment period and this is equal to an annual equivalent interest rate of 1% (AER).</P>
        <P LI="2" el="0" Just="Left">The bond will be issued on behalf of Ireland by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). It will be offered exclusively to participants in this scheme that have been approved by the Department of Justice and Equality. The bond will not be tradable on any market, will not be transferable and must be held by the participant for the full 5 years until it matures.</P>
        <P LI="2">d) A minimum <i>&euro;1,000,000 mixed investment consisting of &euro;500k in property and &euro;500K in immigrant investor bonds</i>.</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>Note: Property investments will be evaluated on their merits by reference to their contribution to the public interest and job creation. In certain circumstances, where the overall investment in property is over &euro;1m and considered to be of particular benefit to the State, a bond investment may not be necessary.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Duration of permission:</i> Successful applicants would get an initial residence permission for 5 years. This is in two tranches. The first permission will cover two years and there is a review at that point to make sure that the investor is continuing to meet the conditions of the scheme (i.e. the investment has not been withdrawn, they continue to be law abiding and self sufficient). Assuming all is in order a further period of 3 years will be granted. After the 5 years have elapsed the investor would be free to apply for ongoing residence in 5 year tranches.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Residency Requirements:</i> The applicant is not required to establish actual residence in Ireland. The programme is about rights of residence that the applicant may exercise as their business and family needs dictate. No minimum residence requirement is set other than the stipulation that the persons concerned should visit Ireland at least once in every 12 month period.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Self Sufficiency:</i> Applicants will be required to be self sufficient and to support their families without recourse to State funds.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Character:</i> Applicants must be of good character and will be required to attest to their bona fides. This will be done via affidavit sworn in this jurisdiction. False, misleading or incomplete information submitted can lead to removal from the State as well as revocation of the immigration permissions.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Provenance of the Funds:</i> The applicant must be able to show the source of the funds proposed for the investment, that the funds were legally acquired, are fully owned by them and are theirs to dispose of as they wish. All funds must be fully compliant with Anti Money Laundering Legislation.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Naturalisation:</i> This is definitively not a &ldquo;passports for sale&rdquo; scheme. The programme deliberately makes no concessions in this area. Investors can qualify for naturalisation on the same basis as other foreign nationals living in Ireland. The minimum period will be 5 years residence as it is for other applicants.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Taxation:</i> The programme makes no provisions in the area of taxation. Taxation will continue to be governed by the applicable taxation laws and international treaties and the programme does not alter that regime in any way.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2. <i>The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><i>Target group:</i> The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme is aimed at people of good character with entrepreneurial ability and some financial backing who wish to start a business in the innovation area.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme provides that migrants with a good business idea in the innovation economy and funding of &euro;75k can be given residency in this State for the purposes of developing their business. No initial job creation targets will be set as it is recognised that such businesses can take some time to get off the ground.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>What Types of Business?</i> This is an important issue. The intention of the programme is to support high potential start-ups. The scheme is not intended for retail, personal services, catering or other businesses of this nature. The Department&rsquo;s existing immigration channel referred to as the &ldquo;Business Permission Scheme&rdquo; remains available to this sort of enterprise. While each application will have to be considered on its merits the sort of business intended for this programme are those that are part of the innovation economy, in areas of high potential growth in the future. The State agencies will play a key role in evaluating the suitability of proposed business proposals for the programme.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Duration and Nature of Immigration Permission</i>: Successful applicants would get an initial residence permission for 2 years to develop the business. After that time their case would be reviewed depending on progress. All going well permission would be renewed thereafter. However if the business has failed and the applicant has no prospect of launching another venture or finding another basis to remain in the State then a different outcome would be likely.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Participants can be joined by immediate family provided that they can show that their family can be fully maintained without recourse to State funds.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Self Sufficiency:</i> Applicants will be required to be self sufficient and to support their families without recourse to State funds.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">3. <i>Evaluation Process</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">All applications for both programmes will be considered by an Evaluation Committee comprised of representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the following Government Departments; Finance; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Health; other Government Departments as the need arises and the Minister&rsquo;s own Department of Justice. Applicants must be of good character and be able to support themselves while in Ireland. Applicants will be required to attest to their bona fides on affidavit sworn here. False, misleading or incomplete information submitted can lead to removal from the State as well as revocation of the immigration permissions. An Annual Report will be published on the operation of the Programmes and they will also be reviewed to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Evaluation Committee will operate to a strict code in its operations. In respect of an individual application the Committee will deal only with the applicant him/herself or with the applicant&rsquo;s duly authorised legal or financial representative. There is no role in this scheme for brokerage, agency or third party intervention. The evaluation committee will not entertain any correspondence from such third parties.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Application Procedures:</i> All applications for either the Immigrant Investor Programme or Start-up Entrepreneur Programme will be made on an application form and will have to be accompanied by an application fee of &euro;750. However the Minister indicated that the fee may be waived on the advice of the evaluation committee in respect of certain entrepreneurship applications where a State agency is a stakeholder in the project.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As to likely uptake, the Minister said</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>&ldquo;I look forward to getting the first set of recommendations from the evaluation committee by early summer. It is impossible of course to predict the level of interest in these programmes and, as I said before, I am making no predictions. Let&rsquo;s wait and see. However I do believe that when you add the specific incentives in these programmes to all of the other benefits that come with living in Ireland there should be significant attractions for participants. We have a strong pro business culture that people will find rewarding. By global standards we live in a country that is safe and tolerant. Education standards are high and we enjoy a climate and clean air environment that many would envy. &rdquo;</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">In conclusion, the Minister thanked his Government colleagues and the various State agencies for their assistance in developing the programmes and looked forward to their ongoing support in their operation.</P>
        <P>A dedicated e-mail address for queries (but not applications) about the investor and entrepreneur schemes has been set up at <i>investmentandstartup@justice.ie</i>.</P>
        <P><i>Any bonds referred to in the above announcement have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;), and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered or sold within the United States (as those terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act).</i></P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 580 to 582, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Incidents involving the use of force by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not recorded in an electronic format at present, although a written record is maintained of the use of incapacitant spray, a baton or a weapon.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, however, currently evaluating a new recording process which will enable incidents involving the use of force to be recorded electronically in the future on the PULSE system.</P>
        <P>The fundamental principle underpinning Garda policy on the use of force is that any action taken must comply with the fundamental principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and accountability and be applied in a non-discriminatory manner in accordance with the principles of the European Convention of Human Rights.  In carrying out their duties, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, as far as practicable and in so far as the circumstances dictate, consider non-physical means prior to resorting to the use of force.</P>
        <P>Insofar as children are concerned the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s draft guidance on the use of force policy outlines that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should give special consideration to the heightened vulnerabilities of children and members of other vulnerable groups in relation to the use of force.  Although not incorporated into domestic law, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  This Convention identifies four core principles:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> The best interests of the child must be paramount (Article 3);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Children have a right to be heard (Articles 12 and 13);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> Children have a right not to be discriminated against (Article 2);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> The State has a duty to protect children (Article 19).</P>
        <P FLI="0">Statistics on the number of times force of any kind was used by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the last eighteen months broken down on a Divisional and District basis is a very broad request and may not be available in the detail sought.  I am making enquiries of the Commissioner as to what statistics are available and I will write to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>Under section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927 (as amended), holders of an on-licence or theatre licence may apply to the District Court for special exemption orders which permit extended opening hours for special occasions. A licensee applying for a special exemption order must serve on the officer in charge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the licensing area concerned a notice of intention to apply for the order at least forty-eight hours before making the application. The District Court may grant the order if it thinks fit to do so having heard the officer concerned but shall not grant an order unless it is satisfied that the special occasion concerned will be conducted in a manner that will not cause undue inconvenience or nuisance to persons residing in the locality or create an undue risk of public disorder there.</P>
        <P>Section 5(5) of the 1927 Act provides that a special exemption order shall expire at 2.30 a.m. (1.00 a.m. where it extends to a Monday that is not a public holiday) unless the Court, for stated reasons, grants the order for a shorter period. Section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 (as amended) allows a further thirty minutes drinking-up time.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Courts Service that the number of special exemption orders granted in the Dublin area in each of the last three years is as follows: 2009 &mdash; 23,343; 2010 &mdash; 26,961; 2011 &mdash; 20,049.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a procurement process for the supply of Garda vehicles is currently being finalised by the National Procurement Service with a view to putting in place a contract which will allow for the provision of additional Garda cars.

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 and 603 together.</P>
        <P>There has been an enormous increase in the volume of applications for a certificate of naturalisation in recent years.  In 2000 the number of applications made that year was just over 1,000 whereas last year the number was 25,671 &mdash; an increase of almost 2,500%.  Quite clearly, this dramatic increase in volume has impacted on the capacity of the administrative system to process them and has given rise to a large volume of cases on hand. This gave rise to a situation where most cases were taking well over two years to complete. I undertook to address this issue and committed to get to the stage that by the second quarter of this year, save in exceptional circumstances, persons applying for a certificate of naturalisation will be given a decision on their application within six months.  In this regard, a major effort has and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I came into office just over a year ago there were about 22,000 cases on hands and, as indicated, applications were taking well over two years to complete. In 2011 over 16,000 applications were dealt with. I expect to have made a decision on 12,000 applications by the end of May this year and a further 12,000 by year end. By contrast, in 2010, a decision was reached in just under 7,800 cases. The number of certificates of naturalisation issued in 2012 up to the 1st April was c. 6,500, equivalent to the total issued in the full year 2010.</P>
        <P>The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  The primary aim, however, over the past year has been to reduce the large volume of cases on hand as swiftly as possible and this has been achieved in the majority of cases.</P>
        <P>By way of general comment, it is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. I can, however, inform the Deputies that steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications and to have made significant inroads into them by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Records are not maintained by the relevant section which processes naturalisation applications in a way which would facilitate the extraction of the detailed information sought by the Deputies without the commitment of significant staffing resources to the task. In any event, my priority is that the outstanding applications be processed and I am reluctant to divert staff from that core duty for no obvious benefit and to no advantage to applicants.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 589, 597 and 605 together.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputies are primarily interested in whether any staff of my Department, who benefited from either the Incentivised Early Retirement Scheme in 2009 or the transitional arrangement that operated up to 29 February, 2012 which allowed public servants to retire on pensions calculated on the basis of the salary scales prior to the January 2010 pay reductions, have subsequently been re-employed by my Department.  Accordingly the information set out below covers the period of both these Schemes.  Information prior to 2009 is not readily available.</P>
        <P>The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER), which was in place from 01 May 2009 to 23 October 2009, allowed public servants, who had not yet reached minimum retirement age, to retire without any actuarial reduction applied to their pension entitlements.  A total of 51 staff in my Department availed of the ISER, none of whom were re-employed by my Department.  Under the terms of the ISER persons who availed of the scheme are not eligible for re-employment by their former public service employer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided that the superannuation benefits of public servants, who retired within a grace period from 1 January 2010 to 29 February 2012, were unaffected by the pay reductions introduced for all public servants under that Act.  A total of 116 staff in my Department retired within this grace period.  A number of these staff retired under the terms of the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme (CNER) while others had reached normal retirement age.  None of these staff have been re-employed by my Department.</P>
        <P>While none of the above staff were re-employed, it should be noted that on occasion, retired public servants may be re-engaged by my Department on a short term basis because of their particular knowledge and expertise in a particular area, for example, to serve on interview boards.</P>

        <P>It is not possible to give an average time frame for processing these applications as each one is given a comprehensive and individual consideration and the facts of each case can vary widely.

        <P FLI="0">For the sake of completeness, the Deputy might note that there were 8,072 cases relating to failed asylum seekers seeking leave to remain in the State at the end of March 2012. The leave to remain process is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy should note that the processing of cases at this point is complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection.   The investigation of such applications requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether or not the applicant is likely to be exposed to serious harm if returned to his/her country of origin. Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person.</P>
        <P>All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.  Steps have been taken to speed up the processing of these applications by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies.</P>

        <P LI="1"><i>I assume that the information sought in respect of humanitarian leave to remain refers to applications made under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999.  These applications arise in circumstances where a non-national who has no permission to be in the State is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead. In the years in question, that is, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, temporary leave to remain was granted to 1,052, 512, 232 and 1,101 persons respectively. Over the same period, in each year the total number of section 3 application cases on hands was approximately 12,000.</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0"><i>In addition, prior to a determination being reached on an application made under section 3 as outlined above, where a subsidiary protection application is submitted it must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection under the criteria defined by the applicable EU Directive. The vast majority of subsidiary applications are from persons who have already been refused refugee status following consideration of their asylum claim by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT). In 2008, 479 decisions were made on applications for subsidiary protection of which seven were granted, 680 decisions made in 2009 of which 27 were granted, 521 made in 2010 of which four were granted and 884 made in 2011 of which 13 were granted.</i></P>

        <P>Under the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation of the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths and the conduct of any subsequent inquest. </P>
        <P>Coroners must ensure that a proper public investigation be seen to take place in order to reassure the public as to the cause of death in all cases of reportable death.  I am aware that it is the practice of our coroners to be especially sensitive in so far as is possible, to the needs of families in the handling of all inquests and particularly so where suicide may be in question. I am aware of the hurt and trauma involved for family members and relatives in all tragic death situations, but perhaps especially in regard to suicide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to suicide, preventative measures and interventions can assist a person in distress from taking that very final step.   In that regard, the work of voluntary groups, such as the one referred to by the Deputy,  who provide practical assistance help and support to persons bereaved by suicide, is of such importance.  I understand that there is a link to that group via the coroner&rsquo;s website &mdash;<i> www.coroners.ie</i>.  In addition, in  September 2010, my Department wrote to each coroner, drawing their attention to the existence of the group in question.</P>
        <P>The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State. It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill this year.</P>
        <P>The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of agencies within my Department&rsquo;s remit is as follows:</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Courts Service</i></P>
        <P>The Courts Service does not have its own internship scheme in place for graduates.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service has facilitated two interns through the JobBridge Scheme which is run by F&Aacute;S.  These interns worked in 2011 in the areas of Information and Communications Technology and in Finance.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service has links with University College Cork and the University of Limerick whereby undergraduates avail of work experience in Court Offices in Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Waterford.  This experience counts for course credits for these undergraduates.  There are currently six undergraduates availing of this work experience scheme.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service is currently considering the further use of interns in 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal</i></P>
        <P>While the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal did have the services of an intern during 2011, there is none on placement there at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Equality Tribunal</i></P>
        <P>The Equality Tribunal provides one internship place under the JobBridge scheme.  Two persons have taken up placements to date. The first, an intern at Legal Research Assistant level completed a full 9 month placement in January 2012. A second person has started in April 2012 in a Legal Assistant role.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Irish Human Rights Commission</i></P>
        <P>The Human Rights Commission has four internship schemes.  Since being introduced in 2008, 33 persons have availed of internships with the Commission.  18 persons have been placed on the Commission&rsquo;s Internship Programme for recent graduates and 10 on the Professional Placement programme for professionals looking to increase their experience, with these placements being for 4 months on a full time basis.  In addition, 3 internships were arranged for persons from overseas Colleges, and two persons have been placed through the JobBridge Programme (National Internship Scheme). 4 interns are currently placed with the Commission.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Irish Prison Service</i></P>
        <P>To date 9 persons have taken up JobBridge placements with the Irish Prison Service and these were assigned through my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Division.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Legal Aid Board</i></P>
        <P>While the Legal Aid Board does not have a formal internship scheme in place, it does participate actively in the National Internship Scheme (JobBridge). The Board currently has eight solicitors and four administrative staff on internships through that scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>National Disability Authority</i></P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority (NDA) does not have a graduate intern scheme but has availed of interns <i>via</i> the Job</P>
        <P>Bridge and Work Placement Programme (WPP1) Scheme. The NDA currently has one intern from the Job Bridge Scheme who will be retained until October 2012 and has had one intern under the WPP1 Scheme whose placement terminated in February 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Office of the Data Protection Commissioner</i></P>
        <P>While the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has had a practice in the past of taking one law undergraduate from University College Cork for a period of approximately four weeks each year, it is now participating in the Job Bridge Scheme and currently has two law graduates on placement as part of that scheme.  The Office also from time to time takes applications from graduates with relevant qualifications/experience on an ad hoc basis for a period of weeks to provide them with relevant work experience.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Private Security Authority</i></P>
        <P>The Private Security Authority (PSA) has participated in the Job Bridge Scheme and two graduates have availed of this scheme with the PSA to date.  Both have completed their internships with the PSA and their work during their period of internship with the Authority has proven to be of great benefit to both the Authority and the interns concerned.  The requirement for graduate interns is project-driven and currently there are no projects where the input of these persons is required.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also be interested to note the following information in respect of placements made by my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Division across the Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has been offering temporary work experience opportunities for a number of years through an Intern Scheme and under the F&Aacute;S Work Placement Programme, focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on law graduates and final year law students.</P>
        <P>Since July 2011, my Department has been actively engaging in the Government&rsquo;s new National Internship Scheme (JobBridge) as referred to earlier.  My Department has advertised internship opportunities across a range of vocational areas including the areas of legislation, statistics, procurement, customer relations and general administration.  To date 39 individuals, 21 of whom were graduates and some of whom, as already indicated, were assigned to the agencies referred to above, have taken up JobBridge placements in my Department across a number of areas including those dealing with immigration, asylum and citizenship, courts policy, domestic and gender based violence, crime and anti-human trafficking.  In all cases a mentor has been appointed to the intern to provide support and guidance and to ensure that he/she benefits from specific learning outcomes associated with that internship opportunity.</P>
        <P>Finally, I believe that the National Internship Scheme (JobBridge) provides opportunities for my Department, and the Civil Service generally, to assist in the process of national recovery.  My Department can provide significant and in some cases challenging job experience opportunities to persons in need of such opportunities and better prepare them for either re-entry to the jobs market or a change in job direction.</P>

Where such a member is involved in a road traffic accident which is caused by the negligence of another party he or she has a right to commence a civil claim against that party.</P>
        <P>If a member is involved in a road traffic accident in which there was no other party involved and they themselves were not at fault they may apply for compensation where they suffer certain categories of serious injury.  Under this arrangement a particular lump sum is specified as compensation according to the level of injury suffered.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in May, 2008.</P>
        <P>The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character, lawful residence and intention to continue to reside in the State, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application.  I can inform the Deputy that good progress continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

        <Quest> the fate of the carcasses and manure of the five mink farms at which mink are killed; if his attention has been drawn to the environmental and health risks from disposing of carcasses of mink in landfills when mink are killed using barbiturates and that mink can be carriers of the transmissible encephalopathy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Holders of licences to keep mink are subject to conditions which include compliance with all relevant legislation concerning the environment, animal health and welfare.  Licence holders are subject to regular inspection by officials from my Department to establish that they are compliant with those conditions.</P>
        <P>Mink carcasses are generally disposed of by rendering as animal by products (ABP) at approved Category 1 rendering plants.  The animals are killed humanely by gas and not by lethal injection such as barbiturates unless in exceptional circumstances they are put down by a veterinarian.</P>
        <P>Land-spread of manure from mink farms does not present a risk with regard to the spread of any serious transmissible diseases thus manure from these farmed animals is treated the same as other manures in that it can be spread on land as fertilizer to increase the nutrient value of the soil.</P>
        <P>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy is extremely rare in mink. Isolated outbreaks have been reported in the USA and some Eastern European countries but no case has been reported since 1985.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest> if he has secured approval for the changes proposed in Budget 2012 to the disadvantaged area scheme; the changes that will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The changes to the rules governing the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, as outlined in the following paragraphs, have today been published by my Department.  However, as these proposals have yet to be approved by the EU Commission, they may be subject to change.</P>
        <P>Terms and Conditions booklets currently being prepared and will be issued in the coming days to each individual land owner whose farm is wholly or partially classified as Disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes are as follows:</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Requirement to have met a stocking density of 0.3 lu/ha in 2011</i></P>
        <P>In the first instance, an applicant is required to have met a stocking density in 2011, for three consecutive months, of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare.</P>
        <P>However, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to lower stocking by agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</P>
        <P>All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.</P>
        <P>The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Minimum Stocking Density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in 2012</i></P>
        <P>While the minimum stocking density remains at 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, the applicant must meet the minimum stocking requirement for six consecutive months during the scheme-year. In addition, the stocking density is calculated over the twelve months of the scheme-year.</P>
        <P>Again, there will be a continued recognition of farmers, who will not meet the minimum stocking requirement due to the impact of agri-environment measures, including the NPWS Review, which has established stocking densities for all commonages, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) and Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Differential Rate of Aid</i></P>
        <P>Where the applicant&rsquo;s main holding/residence is situated in a non-DAS area and where some of that applicant&rsquo;s land declared is non-Disadvantaged land, a digressive of aid will be payable, on the ratio of non-Disadvantaged/Disadvantaged lands farmed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Inclusion of horses from equine breeding enterprises and donkeys</i></P>
        <P>While horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.  Equine breeding enterprises are defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine breeder and have bred a foal, from a mare registered as on the applicant&rsquo;s holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, which was registered in a Stud Book approved by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with pedigree recorded (sire and dam).</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the premises of all who meet this criteria must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with S.I. No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.</P>
        <P>Where these criteria are met, the following equines will then be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 Scheme:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />All equines aged one year to five years, (aged using 1 January), registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his/her holding;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Breeding mares, registered as having been on the applicant&rsquo;s holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in either 2009, 2010 or 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Donkeys will be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation where the animals in question are appropriately registered and in respect of which the relevant identification documentation has been issued, showing the animal(s) concerned as being in the ownership of the given applicant.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5"><i>Distance from main holding</i></P>
        <P>Where the applicant&rsquo;s main holding/residence is situated in a non-DAS area, land situated more than 80 kilometres from an applicant&rsquo;s main holding is not eligible under the 2012 Scheme.</P>

	<P>The EU Court judgement referred to by the Deputy relates to aquaculture consents in areas designated as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive. The judgement has also affected aquaculture consents in areas designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive. Areas designated under these Directives are known as Natura areas.</P>
        <P>A key priority for my Department has been the need to do everything possible to avoid the imposition of EU fines on the State while simultaneously protecting sustainable employment and economic activity in the aquaculture industry in the context of progressing as quickly as possible with the very detailed process of achieving full compliance with the relevant EU Directives. In accordance with procedures agreed with the EU Commission my Department has not issued any new aquaculture licences for the cultivation of finfish or renewed such licences in Natura areas pending the achievement of full compliance with the relevant EU Directives concerning these areas.</P>
        <P>All applications in Natura areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of Natura areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.</P>
        <P>This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</P>

        <P>Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check of all applications, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), must be completed before any payment can issue. During this checking process it was discovered that the person named had selected an invalid combination of actions on parcel E21212016, namely, Species Rich Grassland, which constitutes an area based action and Tree Planting Whips.</P>
        <P>Under the Terms and Conditions of the scheme area based actions must be delivered on a full LPIS parcel basis, therefore only the Species Rich Grassland is deemed valid on this parcel. The person named was informed in writing dated 28 September and subsequently on 20 January that the Tree Planting Whips was invalid as it was not selected in accordance with the scheme Terms and Conditions.  The person named appealed this decision in writing on 17 February and my Department replied on 29 March that the original decision was upheld. The application of the person named will be processed for payment on the basis of this decision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>For reasons of bio-security, many third countries, or countries outside the EU insist that the animal products exported to them derive from animals originating in the exporting State. The Protocol for pigmeat agreed between my Department and the Chinese Ministry with responsibility for Quality Supervision Inspection and Quarantine in 2005 contains a requirement that &ldquo;<i>slaughtered swine for pork exported to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China shall be born, raised and slaughtered in Ireland</i>&rdquo;.  I understand that the Chinese authorities require similar wording for most, if not all, countries with whom they have agreed veterinary health certificates.  The certification for pigs slaughtered in Northern Ireland is under the remit of the Northern Irish authorities and outside of the control of my Department.  Therefore, as the case you raise refers to pigs slaughtered in Northern Ireland, it is a matter for the Northern Irish authorities and it would be inappropriate for me to raise this issue with the Chinese.  I would also point out that the conditions set out in veterinary health certificates which allow for the export of products to third countries, are ultimately a matter for the importing country.  </P>

        <P>My Department is responsible for the management maintenance and development of six Fishery Harbour Centres located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth. Any property held under lease from my Department at the Fishery Harbour Centres in subject to an individual legal agreement (the lease) between the tenant and my Department. The lease sets out the terms and conditions that apply to the individual property and it is agreed and signed by the tenant and landlord at the commencement of the lease period. In general leases signed prior to the application of Section 132 of the land Coveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009, have what are referred to as &ldquo;upward only rent reviews&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>All leased properties at the six Fishery Harbour Centres are subject to rent reviews in accordance with the rent review terms and conditions of the individual lease.  My Department notifies the tenant of the rent review and the Open Market Value of the premises is assessed, by a qualified valuer.</P>
        <P>If a tenant is not in agreement with a revised valuation the lease document sets out a resolution mechanism by way of the nomination of a Chartered Surveyor, agreed by both the tenant and my Department, to determine the rent.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate and in recognition of the difficulties currently being faced by some businesses operating in my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour Centres I have decided to apply a nil increase on rent reviews falling due in the years 2008-2012.</P>

It offers access to food processing pilot plant facilities and expertise for product development purposes at Teagasc Centres in Ashtown, Dublin and Moorepark, Co. Cork. The Programme acts as a conduit for the transfer and conversion of knowledge into business benefits. The aim is to support innovation and competitiveness in SMEs through knowledge and technology transfer in order to support growth, exports and employment in the sector.

	<P>Discussions on the draft EU proposal for a Regulation to support rural development under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) 2014 to 2020 are continuing at EU level.  The type of afforestation measures to be funded and the level of that funding are still under negotiation.  It is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome of those negotiations or to comment on the structure of any future EU funded afforestation schemes.  On completion of the negotiations at EU level and following a national consultation process, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme for the new round will be submitted for approval to the EU Commission.

	<P>The recent announcement of the commercial partnerships between Irish Agri/Bloodstock Industries and companies in China has huge potential for the Irish thoroughbred sector.  The next step will involve the setting up of an appropriate racing infrastructure in that country.  Training is to be provided in Ireland for trainee jockeys and the Chinese are also interested in seeking equine veterinary expertise as it is their intention to establish world class thoroughbred facilities.  The high standards maintained by the Irish horse industry can act as a useful model.   It should be recalled that the experience in Hong Kong is that the racing industry there operates to the highest animal welfare standards.</P>

The contract is for a maximum of 70 days and to date has cost my Department &euro;10,803.42.  One Assistant Secretary General has been re-engaged by my Department on a part-time contract basis since retiring under the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement in October 2010.  Sanction for this contract was received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The cost to my Department to date is &euro;117,246.37.  This contract is due to expire in October 2012.  One Superintending Senior Research Officer, two Senior Research Officers, and one Superintending Veterinary Inspector are also re-engaged on a contract for services basis for a limited period.  In addition, there are approximately 60 retired Veterinary Inspectors who are available for roster for meat inspection duties, as and when required, on a contract for services basis.  Normal pension abatement rules apply in these cases.  In relation to the semi-State Bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, the query should be addressed to the State Bodies themselves.</P>

	<P>As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The discussions that have taken place to date in relation to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte have been in the context of the valuation process and the possible options, and associated issues, arising from that process.</P>
        <P>No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.  It is therefore not possible to engage in discussions with any party until such time as such a decision is made.  I also wish to advise that I had no discussions in relation to the possible sale of Coillte assets during my recent visit to China.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the National Reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from an independent Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal examines and makes recommendations on applications for additional quota from individual producers on the grounds of hardship and/or animal disease restrictions.  The allocations aim to mitigate, rather than alleviate, difficulties caused by hardship or animal disease.</P>
        <P>The most recent allocations recommended by the Tribunal were in respect of applications received under the animal disease category. To date, a total of 967 applications have been assessed by the Tribunal under this category. Some 26.4 million litres of milk quota has been allocated to 868 applicants, while the number of applicants who did not receive an allocation is 99.</P>
        <P>The recommendations presented by the Tribunal were based on information supplied on the application form by both the applicant or his/her Co-operative.  This information includes restriction dates, total available quota, milk deliveries made in the current year and in the previous two years, herd profile, and stock retained due to restriction.  Among the cases where the Tribunal may recommend &lsquo;nil&rsquo; allocations are those where production was significantly over quota in the previous years or the amount of quota requested is insignificant.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 80 further applications to be assessed by the Tribunal. These applications are from dairy farmers whose herds were restricted after the closing date for above assessments but before the end of the milk quota year. It is expected that these applications will be examined by the Tribunal before the end of April.</P>
        <P>There were 329 applications examined from dairy farmers in County Cork, 33 of which received Nil allocations.</P>

	<P>I am aware that there is very strong demand for hardwood timber for the firewood trade. My Department is addressing supply through grant-aid to forest owners under the Tending and Thinning of Broadleaves scheme. The scheme is targeted at improving the quality of broadleaf of hardwood plantations, and in doing so releases fuelwood onto the market. The scheme will also result, in time, in increased availability of larger sized hardwoods suitable for use in sawmilling and other applications. </P>
        <P>Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as sale of timber, are the responsibility of the company.  I understand, however, that, while Coillte holds auctions of softwood timber on a regular basis, it sells only very small volumes of hardwoods on local sale. I also understand that hardwoods are generally sourced from privately owned old woodland estates.</P>

	<P>Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined, and recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date. </P>
        <P>Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &ldquo;t<i>he Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.&rdquo;  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>A delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) visited Ethiopia earlier this month and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption.  The AAI is currently preparing a report for me on its assessment of the situation which will inform the next steps to be taken.</P>

	<P>The organisation in question was not successful in its request to secure funds for the development of a website and the engagement of a Health Promotion Officer under the 2011 National Lottery Funding Scheme and was advised of this in writing by my Department on 2 December 2011. In this regard the Deputy might note that the overall value of applications received by my Department since its establishment in June of that year amounted to just over &euro;2.4 million which far exceed the available resources. In the circumstances it was not possible, unfortunately, to assist all applicants. However, it will be open to the organisation to re-apply for funding in 2012 under the National Lottery allocation made available to my Department this year and details of the funding scheme, including the related application form, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website  <i>www.dcya.gov.ie</i>. </P>

	<P>The Government currently supports the provision of early childhood care and education through three support programmes &mdash; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme. These programmes are implemented by my Department.</P>
        <P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1st September in the relevant year.  Both community and commercial childcare services are eligible to apply to participate in this programme.</P>
        <P>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefitting from their service.  Because of the current budgetary situation there will be no approvals for new childcare places under this programme in 2012.</P>
        <P>The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010.  The CETS programme provides free childcare places in both community and commercial services to qualifying F&Aacute;S and Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) trainees and students.  Again, due to the budgetary situation, no approvals for new childcare places are currently being made under this programme.</P>

	<P>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  About 66,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.   </P>
        <P>Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year. Children born between 2 February 2008 and 30 June 2009 will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2012 and children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify for the programme in September 2013. There are no exceptions for children who are below the qualifying age.</P>
        <P>The child referred to by the Deputy was born outside the age range for eligibility for the programme in the school year commencing in September 2012 but will be eligible for the programme in the school year commencing in September 2013.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</P>
        <P>My Department also implements the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Parents who consider that they qualify for support under this programme should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee to establish exactly what participating community facilities are available in their area. Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Childcare Committee may be contacted by telephone at01 2368030 or by e-mail at <i>info@dlrchildcare.ie</i>.</P>

The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary care and represents a tangible re-focusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.</P>
        <P>Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA advises that it is at all times open to proposals which can contribute to the achievement of broader social and economic objectives and has committed to giving first option to public bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes.  The provision of primary care centres must be informed by needs analysis, with priority given to areas of urban and rural deprivation.  Therefore it is important to recognise that not all NAMA controlled buildings and sites are appropriately located or suitable.</P>
        <P>I have met with NAMA recently with a view to building on potential synergies between NAMA controlled land and property and the requirements of the health sector, not just in the area of primary care, but in other areas also.  The Health Service Executive and NAMA have been engaging constructively in that regard in recent months and will continue to do so.</P>

	<P>Regulations were introduced in October 2011 to provide a legal basis for community pharmacists to supply and administer seasonal influenza vaccine.</P>
        <P>Unlike registered pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants are not subject to statutory fitness to practise requirements and disciplinary sanctions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 and, therefore, cannot be held personally accountable or restricted from practise for professional misconduct or poor professional performance.  In addition, the Act places no legal obligation on pharmaceutical assistants to undertake continuing professional development to ensure that they continue to be competent and fit to be registered.  Other health professionals involved in the administration of vaccines to patients, i.e. medical practitioners and nurses, are subject to fitness to practise and disciplinary sanction in the event of professional misconduct.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, when the legislation allowing for the administration of seasonal influenza vaccinations by pharmacists was being drafted, it was decided that it should not extend to pharmaceutical assistants.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive have advised that all communications on the seasonal flu vaccination programme, including training, were directed to community pharmacy contractors.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 694 and 695 together.</P>
        <P>I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.  The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget.  In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients.</P>
        <P>Where a hospital is the centre for national specialties it will continue to accept patients from all locations.  In relation to other specialties, hospitals generally do not cover patients outside their catchment area.  However, patients who have received their treatment in such hospitals will continue to receive treatment as long as it is clinically appropriate.</P>
        <P>In relation to the detailed information sought by the Deputy, as these are service matters they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 706 to 710, inclusive, 721 and 722 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE is developing chronic disease programmes to improve patient access and to manage patient care in an integrated manner across service settings.  The programmes aim to deliver better health outcomes, enhanced clinical decision making and more effective use of resources.  Work is ongoing on the  development of the following programmes which are particularly relevant to primary care:  Diabetes; Stroke; Heart Failure; Asthma; and COPD.</P>
        <P>The Diabetes programme is due to commence in Quarter 4 of 2012.  The model of care for the Integrated Care Diabetes Package prescribes that:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes patients will be managed in Primary Care only.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Patients with complicated Type 2 Diabetes, as defined by the National Model of Diabetes Care, will be managed by both primary and secondary care.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. All patients with Type 1 Diabetes, genetic causes of Diabetes (MODY Diabetes), secondary causes of Diabetes, post-transplant Diabetes and pregnancy and Diabetes, will be managed in secondary care only.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A National Steering Committee has been set up to oversee implementation of the Diabetes programme and the key work streams are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Alignment of 10 pilot diabetes initiatives with nationally agreed model of care;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Selection of Phase 1 sites;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Identification of Drug Savings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The work stream to identify Phase I sites is now complete.  Primary Care Teams within the 4 HSE areas have been identified and GP practices have been mapped to these Teams.  The results will be presented to me shortly for consideration.  I would envisage that an announcement will be made thereafter.</P>
        <P>The rollout of the national Diabetes programme is to be phased over 4 years (2012-2015) as follows&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />In 2012, it is aimed to cover up to 1 million of the population.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />2013 targeted to cover additional population of 1.7 million;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />2014 targeted to cover further additional population of 1.7 million;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />2015 targeted to cover final population of 0.45 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">&euro;2million is required for the Diabetes programme in 2012 and this has been identified from within existing HSE resources.  Funding for implementation in 2013 to 2015 is dependent on the identification of savings within the health system which will be re-invested in diabetes care.</P>
        <P>In relation to investment in Primary Care Teams, funding of &euro;20 million has been provided in the HSE&rsquo;s 2012 National Service Plan to fill as many vacancies as possible in primary care that have arisen as a result of the recent public service retirements and to expand existing arrangements where sessional services are provided by allied health professionals.  At this time of scarce national resources, it is essential that such posts will be allocated according to an objective assessment of needs.  The HSE is accordingly analysing the current provision of posts in proportion to population and population health needs to identify which areas are least well served.</P>
        <P>The allocation of the extra posts will be subject to approval by the Universal Primary Care Project Team, which has been tasked with working through the issues relating to the Programme for Government commitments on Primary Care.</P>
        <P>GPs and Primary Care Teams will also be supported in the provision of chronic disease management by a number of complementary initiatives including the development of clinical care pathways and electronic patient information systems.</P>
        <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> provides for the introduction of a new GMS contract with GPs with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  GPs already undergo 4 years vocational training, which includes training in chronic disease management.</P>

	<P>Under its Clinical Programmes Directorate the HSE has established cardiovascular related programmes for Stroke, Heart Failure and Acute Coronary Syndrome to improve and standardise patient care by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to HSE service users.</P>
        <P>The National Stroke Programme aims to provide rapid access to best-quality stroke services; prevent 1 stroke every day and avoid death or dependence in 1 patient every day.  The work of the national programme continues in 2012, including the implementation of the TRASNA project, the development of services for the investigation and treatment of patients with suspected Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA), continued implementation of the stroke register, planning for services to identify patients with high risk factors for stroke (atrial fibrillation) and working in partnership with other relevant clinical care programmes to ensure access to community-based services for stroke patients.  The National Heart Failure Clinical Care Programme aims to reorganise the way heart failure patients are managed in our health service. Over the coming years a co-ordinated, multi-disciplinary and patient focused disease management programme will be rolled out nationally.  While the initial focus of the work is on the creation of dedicated hospital centres where care and expertise in heart failure is concentrated, the majority of people with heart failure are managed in the Community.</P>
        <P>The Programme aims to ensure that every patient with symptoms of heart failure is diagnosed correctly and without delay and seeks to reduce recurrent admissions by 1,000 with additional impact on de novo admissions, thus reducing length of stay, saving 20,000 hospital days per year.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme are to improve the care of the acute coronary patient and to reduce their length of stay in hospital.  The programme is currently aiming to:</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 737 and 768 together.</P>
        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day-case surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>Wisdom Services currently provides services to over 200 people with intellectual disability. The HSE contracts for services with Wisdom Services through a service agreement on an annual basis. Service Agreements are used with a range of providers across many services as the means by which the state contracts for services with voluntary or non statutory providers.  </P>
        <P>Wisdom Services is a voluntary body operated by the Daughters of Wisdom and provides services for people with a disability. It currently has an interim board of governors and an interim executive manager in place. It receives service users from a wide geographical spread. It supports over 200 service users with 111 on campus, 75 in the community and 20 day attendees included respite and shared care options. Wisdom Services is not a limited company so the order has a liability for any deficits.   Under the HSE National Service Plan 2012, the disability budget nationally is being reduced by 3.7% in 2012. The NSP states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies. Despite this additional flexibility, aimed at the most minimal impact on front line services in the first instance, it is most regrettable that Wisdom Services do not appear to be in a position to agree a service level agreement with the HSE for 2012, despite the efforts of the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve this. In this context, the Department of Health is reassured that the HSE and Wisdom Services are working together to ensure that all service users will continue to receive the care and support they require, and that discussions are ongoing in this regard. These discussions are also considering the most appropriate arrangements and funding for the various services delivered by Wisdom Services.</P>

	<P>The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased at alarming speed in recent decades, so much so that the World Health Organisation calls it a global epidemic. The disease is now a major public health problem throughout Europe. The high levels of obesity in all age groups of the Irish population are of increasing concern to me but of particular concern are the rising levels of obesity in young children. Recent figures from research commissioned by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs found that  an alarming figure of 1 in 4 children are overweight or obese at 3 years of age.</P>
        <P>The situation in Ireland mirrors the global obesity epidemic, with 61% of Irish adults now overweight or obese. Most worrying is the fact that childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Europe, with body weight now the most prevalent childhood disease. 26% of 9 year old Irish children are overweight or obese. WHO Europe Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative, in which Ireland participated in 2009, found that 23% of  7 year olds are overweight or obese.</P>
        <P>During 2011 I established a Special Action Group on Obesity comprising key stakeholders, and chaired by my own Department. The group includes a representative from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Safefood and its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity.</P>
        <P>Alone no single initiative will reverse the trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference. The Special Action Group is concentrating on a specific range of measures including Healthy Eating Guidelines for the Irish population, restricting the marketing of food and drink high in fat, sugar or salt to children, nutritional labelling, calorie posting on restaurant menus, the promotion of physical activity and the detection and treatment of obesity. The Group will work with other Government Departments in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity.</P>
        <P>As part of the work plan of SAGO, in February I launched a national consultation to seek opinions on the best way of putting calorie information on menus in Ireland. This is an initiative I announced late last year when I wrote to Fast Food Outlets and Cafes requesting that they begin including calories on their menus. The consultation, being conducted by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, is an opportunity for consumers and the food industry to give their views on how &lsquo;calories on menus&rsquo; can be best implemented in Ireland. The outcome of the consultation will be available at the end of April 2012 and the results, when analysed will inform the next steps in the process.</P>
        <P>Given the available evidence in the area, the Special Action Group on Obesity has recently recommended the establishment of a Steering Group to oversee the carrying out of a Health Impact Assessment on the health and economic aspects of introducing a Sugar Sweetened Drinks tax.  The Institute of Public Health will be facilitating the Department of Health with this assessment.</P>

	<P>Obesity is now one of the largest public health issues in Europe.</P>
        <P>Currently  61% of  Irish adults aged 18-64 years  are overweight or obese. Levels of overweight and obesity have increased in the last 20 years, with a rise from 51% in 1990 to 61% in 2011.</P>
        <P>In those aged over 65 years, 79% were classified as obese or overweight, 84% of men and 73% of women. Looking at the trend since 2007, this shows a decrease in obesity, but an increase in overweight over the 3-4 year period. The increase in overweight can be seen particularly in men.</P>
        <P>Given the data available it is difficult to make projections, however, I am interested in tracking overweight and obesity levels in the Irish population on a regular basis in order to monitor trends carefully and prioritise actions accordingly. My Department is currently considering the best way to achieve this on a regular basis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Obesity is now one of the largest public health issues facing children in Europe and rates of obesity in children have increased rapidly in recent years.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, there have been a number of Irish studies on childhood obesity showing that overweight and obesity levels are on the rise. While these studies have looked at different age groups, it is possible to conclude that up to 1 in 4 Irish primary school children are overweight or obese. This shows that there has been at least a two-fold increase in obesity in children aged 8-12 years since 1990.</P>
        <P>The recent Growing Up in Ireland study found that overweight and obesity levels in children as young as three years of age are also one in four.</P>
        <P>A similar upward trend in levels of overweight and obesity has been found amongst Irish teenagers showing that one in five teenagers are overweight or obese.</P>
        <P>My Department in participating in the World Health Organisation European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative. This study was initiated in 13 European countries, including Ireland in 2007/2008 and it assessed the overweight and obesity levels in 6-9 year old school children. The study is repeated every 2 years and the most recent information on childhood obesity in Ireland comes from Round 2 in 2010. Measurements were recorded for 6,609 children and 23% were classified as either overweight or obese. A significantly greater proportion of girls were overweight or obese compared to boys. The proportion of normal versus overweight and obese children did not change between 2008 and 2010. Round 3 will commence later this year and I am looking forward to seeing if the levels of overweight and obesity will stay stable. Given the data available it is difficult to make projections at present.</P>
        <P>According to Round 1 of the European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative of the WHO, 24% of primary school children throughout Europe are overweight or obese.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 752 and 753 together.</P>
        <P>The Special Delivery Unit was established in my Department last July to tackle patient wait times for hospital services. Unacceptably high wait times have been tolerated for too long and have become systemic for both unscheduled and scheduled care. The problems have to be tackled step by step so that improvements can be sustained. </P>
        <P>Up to now the number of patients waiting for OPD appointment has not been consistently and reliably quantified by all hospitals.  The data has simply not been sufficiently accurate to be meaningful at a national level.  The SDU has now begun to work with the HSE building a new approach to compiling and validating outpatient lists.</P>
        <P>The priority for the first quarter of 2012 was for hospitals to support an SDU/NTPF project to establish weekly monitoring of outpatient waiting list numbers. The first task was to collate, analyse and validate the number of outpatient referrals in the system. This work had been well advanced by the HSE during 2011. Once it has been finalised and considered it will enable the SDU to make recommendations to me in respect of an outpatient wait time target in 2012. In principle I will be adopting the same criteria of strict chronological management of the waiting list which is now in place for in-patient treatment.</P>
        <P>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

	<P>The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established by the HSE in 2005 is part of the internal organisation of that body and the appointment of a Director is a matter for the HSE.  The former Director of the NOSP retired last September and having regard to the importance of the work of the Office, the HSE appointed an Acting Director from the date of  the retirement, pending approval to retain and fill the post following the seeking of expressions of interest and redeployment within the HSE.    The position was initially advertised in February 2012 and interviews were scheduled for March.   However, it came to light that the Expression of Interest Notice did not reach all HSE staff and in the interest of fairness the position was re-advertised nationally to the entire HSE to ensure that all eligible staff were given an equal opportunity to apply.  The new closing date for receipt of applications was 30th March 2012 and interviews are now scheduled for 17th   May 2012.  It is intended that a Director will be appointed when the selection process has been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 760 and 761 together.</P>
        <P>The NTPF have not provided orthodontic treatment in the past as it fell outside of its remit. In July 2011 I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF &mdash; namely that it would move from working to largely outsource treatments for those waiting longest to working with hospitals in a performance improvement capacity to improve access to scheduled care.  The NTPF has been aligned with the Special Delivery Unit and is now targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU&rsquo;s performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>By the end of 2011, very significant progress had been made on SDU initiatives in relation to unscheduled care and inpatient/day case targets.  In order to maintain and improve on these targets, the SDU has advised the HSE of a penalty scheme which will be levied on hospitals which fail to treat inpatients and day cases within the 12 month target.</P>
        <P>The priority for the first quarter of 2012 is for hospitals to support an SDU/NTPF project to establish weekly monitoring of outpatient waiting list numbers. The first task is to collate, analyse and validate the number of outpatient referrals in the system. This work has been well advanced by the HSE during 2011. Once it has been finalised and considered it will enable the SDU to make recommendations to me in respect of an outpatient wait time target in 2012. In principle I will be adopting the same criteria of strict chronological management of the waiting list which is now in place for in-patient treatment. When this process is competed it will inform my decision on how to best approach orthodontic waiting lists  The difficult budgetary position facing the health services this year means that maintaining and building on services will be a significant challenge particularly in the initial few months of 2012, typically the busiest time for acute hospitals. However, I am encouraged by the recent successes of the SDU and those involved in the delivery of acute hospital services.</P>

        <P>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</P>

	<P>Under Action 119 of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, work is under way to research and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative correction/rehabilitation programmes for a range of road traffic offences, with a particular emphasis on high risk re-offenders.  This includes repeat drink-driving offenders.</P>
        <P>My Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Road Safety Authority (RSA), the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been engaged in discussions on this matter.  The range of alternatives available includes requiring repeat offenders to take certain courses, to resit tests, or to have particular types of device fitted to their vehicles.  Discussion has focused on the range of options, their feasibility in an Irish context and how they might work in practice.  In addition, the RSA has engaged consultants to examine, in particular, the technological options for sentencing alternatives.  That study is due to be completed by early May 2012.</P>
        <P>There is general agreement on the need to explore new ways of tackling the problem of people who are repeatedly involved in road traffic offences.  However, no decisions have yet been made on which measures would be most appropriate or would work best in an Irish context.  Further discussion will be necessary between my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, the RSA, the Courts Service, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to ensure that the most appropriate solutions are chosen.  Implementation will necessarily involve changes to primary legislation, at which time a Regulatory Impact Analysis will be carried out.</P>

	<P>Under the Road Traffic Act 2002 penalty points are required to be endorsed on the Irish driving licence record held on the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and a current driving licence is required to serve penalty points.  While in the majority of cases this endorsement takes place without difficulty against the relevant NVDF driver record there are circumstances where endorsement of the points on the NVDF is not possible. </P>
        <P>It is not possible to determine the number of drivers who have not had penalty points applied to their licences on the NVDF due to the absence of driving licence numbers in the data provided by the Courts Service. However since 2002 some 83,788 penalty points offences ( total of 365,795 penalty points) received from the Courts could not be associated with the relevant driving licence record on the NVDF. This is broken down as follows with overall penalty points offences for each year also included. In all these cases the NVDF issued a notification of penalty points to the driver in question so the driver is aware of the situation.</P>

         <P FLI="0">The Road Traffic Act 2010 requires a motorist to provide a driving licence and a copy of their licence in Court. The purpose of bringing a copy of the licence is to speed up the logistical and administrative recording of the driver number to facilitate its availability for update of the NVDF. It also means that the motorist does not have to surrender their licence to the Court for processing.</P>
        <P> I refer the Deputy to replies given by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality to Deputy Broughan on 7th March  (Ref: 13045/12) and on 18 April (Ref: 19071/12) which stated that the Courts Service are making the necessary arrangements to facilitate the recording of the driving licence number.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the provision of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as the renewal of the bus fleet for PSO services comes under the remit of the NTA.   </P>
        <P>While the question relates to additional buses, it is assumed that the information being sought is in respect of the replacement bus fleet also.  Accordingly, the information being provided relates to bus purchases by Dublin Bus over the period 2008 to 2012, whether additional fleet or replacement fleet.      Following the placement of an order for 100 new buses at the beginning of 2008, Dublin Bus took delivery of that order over the course of 2008 and 2009. No EU funding was received in respect of these buses.    I understand from the NTA that since that delivery, no new buses were purchased in 2010 or 2011.  Dublin Bus are conducting a tender competition for the delivery of 80 new buses, with delivery intended to be over the second half of 2012 or possibly early 2013.  As that is an on-going tender competition, the exact costs are not yet available.  Funding for that purchase will be provided by the NTA from the capital allocation provided by my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 784 to 786, inclusive, and 791 together.</P>
        <P>The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the statutory body responsible, in accordance with the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003, for the regulation of the taxi sector in Ireland, including issues related to the transfer of SPSV licences, controls on fares and related charges and the area of operation for licensed drivers. I will arrange for your correspondence to be forwarded to the NTA for direct reply where appropriate. If you do not receive a reply within ten working days please notify my private office.  </P>
        <P>I should add that the NTA is currently working on progressing recommendations contained in the Taxi Regulation Review Report in accordance with the timeframes set out in the Report. </P>
        <P>The Review Group agreed to introduce a prohibition on the transferability of taxi vehicle licences such that after 1st October 2012 all taxi vehicle licences will be unique to the person to whom the licence has been issued and cannot be transferred or sold to another individual.  I understand that the NTA are currently examining future arrangments for multiple licence holders including those who operate family businesses.</P>

	<P>Athletes from thirteen countries will train at the National Aquatic Centre (NAC) in the lead up to the London Olympic and Paralympic Games including the US Synchronised Swim Team, the South Korean National Squad, the UK Paralympic Swimming Squad and individual swimmers from the Cayman Islands, Poland, Venezuela and Surinam.   A pre-Olympic Water Polo Tournament taking place in the NAC in July will involve participation by Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Romania, Great Britain and current Olympic Champions Hungary.  A number of other Olympic related events are also taking place in Ireland before the Games with international participants.  A Men&rsquo;s Hockey Olympic Qualifying Tournament was hosted at the National Hockey Stadium in UCD last month.  In July, the World Youth Sailing Championships will take place in Dun Laoghaire while Morton Athletics Stadium in Santry will host a Pre-Games International Athletics Event.      </P>
        <P>The US Synchronised Swimming Squad trained at the NAC earlier this month and will return to the centre for further pre-London training in July and August.  The squad worked closely with the NAC to be as accessible as possible to the Irish public during their first training camp. They visited Temple Street Hospital and hosted a Workshop for the NAC Synchronised Swimming Girls Academy. The squad&rsquo;s visit culminated in a public performance at the NAC, attended by over 2,000 people, with all proceeds going towards Temple Street Hospital.</P>

        <Quest> the analysis the National Transport Authority has carried out to model traffic projection over the next ten years in the greater Dublin area; and if in the absence of the introduction of the Dublin metro system and the East Wall rail interconnector, how he expects to avoid major traffic congestion on the M50 and other strategic sections of the road network should there be an increase in traffic volumes due to a return to economic growth in the same time period. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has, as a statutory function, the undertaking of strategic planning of transport in the Greater Dublin Area.  Section 12 of that Act requires the NTA to prepare a strategic transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area.  </P>
        <P>I understand that in the preparation of a draft strategic transport plan, which was published for consultation in draft form during 2011, the NTA carried out considerable analysis of projected transport demands throughout the region and assessment of various proposals to address those demands.  I further understand that the horizon year for that analysis was 2030, being the end of the proposed strategic plan period that was selected by the NTA.  I am also informed by the NTA that the work carried out on that plan did include assessment of various measures against what is termed a &ldquo;do-minimum&rdquo; scenario, being the scenario that would be expected to happen in the absence of various proposals being implemented.   It is the case that the non-development of certain public transport projects would, in the longer term, result in increased car usage along those corridors.   However, in the case of Metro North and DART Underground schemes, these projects have not been cancelled. The position is clearly stated in the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium-term Exchequer Framework, in relation to these schemes that &ldquo;they are being postponed for consideration in advance of the next capital programme which will be drawn up in 2015 and will cover the period from 2016 onwards.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In relation to the M50 motorway, the planning consent granted for the M50 upgrade requires that a scheme of specific demand management measures for the motorway corridor is published by the relevant road authorities no later than three years after the upgrade has been completed. The overall M50 upgrade project was completed in September 2010.</P>
        <P>A group comprising officials from Dublin City Council, South Dublin, Fingal, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and the NRA has been set up to examine the implementation of measures that would meet the requirements of the Bord Plean&aacute;la decision.</P>

	<P>Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) on 1st December 2009, the provision of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as LUAS BXD, now comes under the remit of the NTA.</P>
        <P> You will be aware that arising from their consideration of the railway order application, An Bord Pleanala (APB) wrote to both the RPA and the NTA seeking clarification of certain matters relating to the planning application. Both organisations responded to APB by the specified date, i.e. 30th March 2012.</P>
        <P>BXD is a priority project under the Government&rsquo;s capital investment programme for transport to 2016 &mdash; &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016 &mdash; Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;.  Therefore funding has been included in my Departments capital allocation to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  Construction is expected to take 4 years. </P>
        <P>However, key decisions and actions which will determine the precise construction start must await the outcome of the planning process.</P>
