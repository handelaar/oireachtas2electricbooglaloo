        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>     the number of households yet to switch over to digital television; the proportion of relevant households yet to switch; his views on whether this number will fall significantly; if he has any contingency plan in place if significant numbers do not switch; and if he will make a statement on the matter.     </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>It is estimated that about 250,000 households are solely reliant on the Irish analogue television network.  A similar number use the network for secondary televisions.  These households must change to digital by 24 October or be left without access to television.  Households who only use pay television platforms, which is about 81% of households, will not be affected by analogue switch off.</P>
        <P>In preparation for digital switch over, RT&Eacute; was required to build and make available a new free to air digital network to 98% of the population.  Its Saorview digital television service has been available nationally since May 2011.  It currently provides access to free to air television to almost 98% of the population and will fulfil the full extent of its coverage obligations by 24 October 2012.  For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched Saorsat in March 2012.  Saorsat is a free to air satellite system providing access to RTE channels and TG4.  Since March 2012, therefore, everyone in Ireland can make the switch to digital.</P>
        <P>Equipment for both Saorview and Saorsat is readily available throughout the country.  I have been informed by Saorview that over 400 retailers nationwide stock Saorview approved equipment.  Saorview television equipment costs from &euro;50 while the Saorsat set top box costs around &euro;180.  More and cheaper Saorsat equipment is anticipated.  To date, over 150,000 Saorview television sets and 50,000 Saorview set top boxes have been purchased.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s national digital switch over public information campaign rolled out in September 2011 and provides information on what is happening, the time lines and the different choices available to upgrade to digital.  This comprehensive campaign includes advertising on television, local and national radio; an analogue marker to act as a constant reminder to everyone using the analogue service to switch to digital; a dedicated website; research; a national telephone helpline; and an information booklet delivered to every household in the country by the final week in July.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>I have also introduced an outreach programme to ensure vulnerable people receive one-to-one help in making the switch to digital.  Over the same period, Saorview has been operating its own information campaign.  Both campaigns will ensure that there is full awareness of digital switch over well in advance of 24 October.</P>
        <P>Initial feedback from the outreach programme is positive; people know what is happening but they are inclined to leave switching over until very close to the switch off.  This mirrors what has happened in other European countries which have successfully achieved analogue switch off.  On this, Saorview is advising households to upgrade quickly because the cheaper Saorview equipment might be sold out.</P>
        <P>I would urge any voluntary organisations to contact their local champion and become involved in the national digital switch over effort.  As I made clear last Thursday at the special digital switch over briefing session to which all Oireachtas Members were invited, the date of analogue switch off will not be changed.  On Wednesday, 24 October this year, 120 days from now, the analogue system will cease to operate.  I am confident that, by the switch off date, as a result of the national information and the Saorview campaigns and the outreach programme that is now in place, everyone will be fully aware that the analogue network is closing down on 24 October 2012 and of their switch over options.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  On the information campaign, this morning I received in my Oireachtas pigeonhole a copy of the information booklet that is being circulated.  What are the modalities of the distribution and will it be distributed by An Post?  I am concerned that we get clarification and that we do not have a similar situation to that which pertained when we had the household charge information campaign.  In other words, if we go through An Post, which is the premier door to door distributor of such material, can we be guaranteed that every house will get the booklet?  There appears to be an information deficit with regard to the changeover.  I acknowledge it is difficult to try to communicate a deadline in the future, as it is not an issue that is uppermost in people&rsquo;s minds.  I am anxious that the booklet is distributed through An Post, because that provides a guarantee, in so far as An Post can guarantee, that it will be delivered to every household.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of the information campaign is newspaper advertising.  Will the information campaign use local and regional newspapers rather than national newspapers, because many people do not read the national papers as assiduously as the local and regional papers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>We have taken every reasonable step to ensure there should not be an information deficit.  The advertisements are rolling all the time and there is a bug that occasionally makes an appearance on people&rsquo;s television screens warning them that they better make the move before 24 October.  The booklet to which the Deputy referred, is being delivered to people&rsquo;s households currently by An Post and I am confident, given An Post&rsquo;s performance in similar campaigns or general elections, the booklet will get to every household in the country.  It is an accessible guide to what people must do in order to make the switch.  Deputy Collins is right in that there is a danger some people will wait until the last minute.  In such circumstances they run the risk of a blank screen because in the digital world it is not that they will get a faded, difficult picture; they will get no picture.  Deputy Collins asked me whether I have any contingency plan if significant numbers do not switch.  I am glad he did not follow up the question but to emigrate is the only contingency plan.  In the meantime we need to bring home to people that they should make the switch or there will be no television.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>What is the position with local and regional newspaper advertising?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I cannot answer whether there will be local newspaper advertising but we have taken great pains to communicate with, relate to and do interviews for local radio to sell the idea.  They have been doing this already.  In addition, the outreach programme in place is built entirely on community groups organised by The Wheel, whether the GAA, Muinitr na T&iacute;re, the IFA or whoever.  They have the information on a parish level.  Each country has nominated a digital champion who has been given a measure of training on what is needed.  These people, in turn, have their finger on the pulse and will know of someone living in a remote area, someone who is not technically competent or who believes that he is not technically competent to make the switch, or who might not have members of family who can do it for them.  These champions are feeding back to us all the time and this is one good aspect of the roll-out programme.</P>

        <asker>    Deputy Martin Ferris</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>     his views on whether there should be a universal service obligation imposed on mobile phone service providers.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[30797/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended.  In accordance with this function and with its obligations under national and EU law, ComReg is obliged to ensure the efficient management and use of the radio frequency spectrum.  ComReg is independent in the exercise of the spectrum management function.  In line with its statutory functions, ComReg has consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands, which are used to provide licensed mobile telephone services.  I am advised that ComReg received considerable interest in this consultation process, which has resulted in a decision document for the award of several individual rights of use in the above radio spectrum bands.  This document, known as ComReg document 12/25 and decision 04/12, was published on 16 March 2012 and is available on ComReg&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>ComReg&rsquo;s information memorandum for this award process details the processes and procedures that the regulator is employing to implement its substantive decisions.  This document is also available on ComReg&rsquo;s website.  It is known as ComReg document 12/52 and was published on 25 May 2012.  The reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its decisions on the minimum coverage and roll-out requirements are set out in section 5.5 of document 12/25.</P>
        <P>Among other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed the 70% population obligation by a considerable margin given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>The importance of maintaining the existing levels of mobile telephony and mobile broadband coverage has been raised with ComReg by my officials.  While the outcome of the forthcoming multi-band spectrum release process can not be anticipated, I understand ComReg is not expecting any reduction in coverage as a result of this process.</P>
        <P>The four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their current respective licences.  For example, for third generation or 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as &ldquo;3&rdquo;, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is more than its obligation.  Furthermore, as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s national broadband scheme and rural broadband scheme, all parts of Ireland will have access to a basic broadband service by 2013.  ComReg&rsquo;s coverage proposals are designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a manner that would ensure cherry-picking of high density urban areas would not occur.  With regard to the question of whether a universal service obligation should be imposed on mobile phone service providers, I advise the Deputy that the setting of such obligations are subject to the EU universal service directive.  The directive requires the setting of a universal service obligation to provide a network connection at a fixed location and does not provide for such an obligation in respect of mobile coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he is aware, there is no designated universal service obligation provider for the mobile telephone sector at present.  However, Eircom is the designated provider for landlines.  I understand ComReg is currently deciding whether to renew it.  I raise the issue because I fear that if ComReg does not impose a universal social obligation on mobile telephone operators, successful bidders for the new licences will concentrate on large urban areas, to the detriment of the rural areas in which 30% of the population live.  ComReg has indicated that competition among companies for customers in rural areas will ensure coverage but I am not so sure that will be the case.  Supply, demand and profit will be determining factors.  Does the Minister agree that a universal social obligation should apply, as is the case for landlines and postal services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Ferris is correct that mobile services are not subject to the same universal social obligations as fixed lines.  I started out from a similar position to that of the Deputy.  My officials have discussed this issue with ComReg on several occasions and I have met its representatives on more than one occasion.  ComReg is adamant that difficulties will not arise for a number of reasons.  First, the infrastructure is in place and the masts have already been erected.  There will be no roll-back on that.  Second, the obligations on Vodafone, 3 and O2 in respect of 3G services were greatly exceeded.  Third, mobile telephone companies are already competing to provide services and there is no question of a diminution of that competition.  The 70% idea arose principally because it was considered desirable that such a large figure be a requisite to prevent cherry picking by a new entrant to the market.  A new company would not be able to pick populous urban centres while avoiding regional, provincial or rural areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I have a supplementary question on a slightly different matter.  I have been in touch with the Minister&rsquo;s office and ComReg regarding Meteor&rsquo;s refusal to release an individual from a mobile telephone contract even though it has been proven that it cannot provide her with a service.  ComReg has indicated that it powerless to do anything about the matter.  Can anything be done for people who enter into contracts and discover at a later stage that the service is unavailable in their home despite a commitment from the service provider?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>If the service provider agreed contractually to provide the service, it seems to me it is obliged to provide it.  I would need to see the details of the contract but I would be happy to raise the matter with the authority that has statutory responsibility for consumer protection in this area if the Deputy outlines the details.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>     the safeguards that are in existence to protect confidentiality of telephone calls emanating from banking and other financial institutions, insurance companies, telecom companies and a growing number of other organisations here (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to the use of these techniques; and if he will introduce legislation to enable the recipients of these calls to be provided with a transcript of the tape recording within seven days of the recorded conversation.     </Quest>
        <QRef>[30996/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Calls of the nature referred to by Deputy Tom Fleming are regulated in accordance with the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011, known as the e-privacy regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement of these regulations falls to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Regulation 13 of the e-privacy regulations seeks to protect individuals from receiving unsolicited communications for the purpose of direct marketing.  The regulation covers the making of unsolicited telephone calls and the sending of unsolicited fax messages, e-mail and SMS text messages for direct marketing purposes and gives individuals the right to prevent organisations from using electronic means to contact them in order to sell a product or service.  Since the introduction of the e-privacy regulations in July 2011, it is an offence for a marketer to make an unsolicited marketing telephone call to a mobile telephone without the prior consent of the telephone subscriber.  With regard to landlines, the national directory database opt-out register has been in operation for several years.  The register allows consumers to have their numbers registered to prohibit marketers from cold calling them.  Over 1.16 million landlines are on the register.</P>
        <P>It is an offence for a marketer to make a marketing call to such registered numbers.  Where subscribers choose not to place their number on the register, they may still protect themselves from continuous marketing calls by requesting the marketer not to call them again.  A marketer who fails to respect such a request commits an offence.  I am satisfied there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure consumers can be protected against such cold calling if they so wish and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard at the current time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>I am glad to hear there is some provision out there.  The vast majority of the public are unaware of these measures and that regulations protect those with mobiles and landlines.  There is a growing trend of people being inundated by telephone calls from finance, telephone and insurance companies.  People receive calls on a cold call basis and they are caught on the hop.  Various offers and incentives to take up attractive offers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I ask Deputy Fleming to frame a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister take up this point and contact the Data Protection Commissioner?  We need stronger measures and more assistance for the public.  People should be facilitated to ensure they are not plagued with unwanted telephone calls.  The calls have a contractual basis and people are led into having a talk to take up a particular offer.  It appears to be a semi-contract and some weeks later people receive further telephone calls.  Unfortunately, people do not recollect the original telephone call.  Will the Minister provide further protection?  People take a telephone call and may be unaware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Thank you Deputy.  I call on the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>They are given brief notice that the telephone call is being recorded.  I call for further protection for the public and those receiving calls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I accept that the practices described by Deputy Fleming take place.  It may be that the e-privacy regulations, which I transposed into Irish law last summer, need further promulgation and need to be brought to the attention of consumers in the manner described by Deputy Fleming.  Where calls are recorded and retained by the marketing company, the subscriber has the right of access to a copy of the recording under section 4 of the Data Protection Act.</P>
        <P>With regard to the confidentiality of marketing telephone calls and the recording thereof, the provisions of the Data Protection Acts concerning the processing of personal data are applicable.  As I said in my response, some 1.16 million landline telephones are on the register and their owners will not be pestered in the manner the Deputy described.  He is correct that there is no such register in the case of mobile telephony, but other protections are in place.  These include not only the Data Protection Acts, but European Union privacy regulations.  Deputy Fleming may well be correct that it is more a matter of promoting, promulgating and publicising their existence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister should instigate a publicity campaign to educate the public regarding these regulations and their entitlements.  Raising awareness is the main issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not dispute the Deputy&rsquo;s argument that there are many people who are not aware of their rights in this regard and that we should seek to address this.  If I can help to publicise the protections that are in place, I will endeavour to do so.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>On 11 May 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published its preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction in the form of a small desk-based study carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  Among the main findings of this review was the observation that the integrity of the well is vital for minimising potential impact in regard to fracking in terms of ground water contamination from leaks and well blow-outs, in which instances fracking fluid could potentially enter groundwater.  The knowledge of local geology was identified as an important issue, as was the question of the carbon footprint arguments in regard to natural gas.  In terms of environmental impacts, the report outlined potential impacts due to the large volumes of water used and related issues in regard to storage and disposal.</P>
        <P>Arising from that report, it is the intention of my Department, in conjunction with the EPA, to undertake a second, more broadly-based study in order to identify best practice in respect of environmental protection for the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques.  It is anticipated that this research will commence later in the year, following the engagement of the relevant experts.  The conduct of the study is expected to take up to 12 months, which would give a potential publication date in late 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party&rsquo;s position is that the issuing of any further licences, whether exploratory or preliminary, should be put on hold in the absence of a broader national policy.  We must move with haste to address these issues.  The Minister of State outlined the findings of the desk study that is in the public domain.  In regard to the second report he has commissioned, will he indicate or undertake to publish its terms of reference?  I was going to probe him on the time line, but he has indicated it will be 12 months.  When will the research commence and when will it finish?  What form will the public consultation take?  This is a highly contentious issue in communities throughout the State, as the Minister of State knows.  The greater the level of public engagement on the issue, the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>I agree that we must have full engagement with the public, particularly with regard to the terms of reference of this study.  A steering committee will comprise, among others, representatives of the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The call for research will go out later this year.  We intend to publish the terms of reference and to have public consultations on them before we proceed with the actual study.  The terms of reference are critical because the outcome of further research will assist in a robust, scientific-based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology.  Until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA&rsquo;s research, I can confirm that the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>If the Minister of State is in a position to do so, can he clarify who the chairperson will be?  He mentioned a number of organisations but will he be appointing an independent chairperson to co-ordinate the public consultation and the exercise in preparing the report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>I presume that the Department itself will be involved in the research along with the EPA.  The key thing is that we get robust scientific facts, not fiction.  Whatever the facts are we must find them in their finest, broadest, most scientific and analytical detail.  The terms of reference will be on the websites of the Department and the EPA freely, openly and transparently so people can make representations.  It will proceed by the end of this year and nothing can happen until then.  There will not, and cannot, be any hydraulic fracturing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister of State said that no other exploratory licences would be issued.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes.  The only ones that have been issued were issued by the former Minister of State, Mr. Conor Lenihan.  He is the only person who issued a licensing option.  Nothing else will happen until this research is launched.  The Deputy does have a point, however, in that under the licensing option issued by the previous Government, the company will have an opportunity before end-March 2013 to indicate if it will proceed to the next phase, which is an exploration phase.  It is up to the company to do that and we cannot anticipate what will happen.  Even if it does that, however, nothing will happen until this report is in place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Last month, I launched a new Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-20.  Under this strategy the development of wind farms in Ireland will play a critical role in delivering on our renewable energy ambitions, both in terms of meeting our own national 2020 targets and in contributing to the development of a renewable electricity export market with the UK in the first instance.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable growth in the deployment of wind farms in Ireland from around 300 MW of capacity in 2005, to over 1,600 MW of capacity operational in the market today.  The latest forecasts from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is around 4,000 MW of operational capacity, subject to achieving our energy efficiency goals.</P>
        <P>Currently, approximately 1,900 MW of renewable generation is connected to the grid, including over 1,600 MW of wind generation.  A further 1,500 MW of renewable generation, almost all of which is new wind-generating capacity, has contracted with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, operates a processing approach for wind projects looking to connect to the electricity grid.  This allows for a strategic view to be taken of network requirements and serves to put in place efficient connection solutions to cater for a large number of applications and to ensure optimum network development, minimising network costs and, where possible, avoidance of network bottlenecks.  The EirGrid GRID25 strategy was devised to put in place the necessary infrastructure needed to underpin this market growth.</P>
        <P>To date there have been three gates and in the latest Gate 3 phase some 3,900 MW of offers have issued to renewable generators.  The take-up of Gate 3 offers cannot be quantified as yet.  Somewhere around 500 MW of Gate 3 have accepted their offers to date and have already contracted with EirGrid or ESB Networks.  It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2, and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3, is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.</P>

        <P>In December last, the EU published an Energy 2050 roadmap which sets out a number of different scenarios for developing a decarbonised energy sector over the coming decades.  It is clear under all of these scenarios that there will be a significant increase required in renewable energy deployment in Europe, well over and above the 2020 target levels.  Following on from the Energy 2050 roadmap, earlier this month the CER published a &ldquo;Renewable Energy Communication&rdquo;, which again outlines their ambition to progress beyond the 2020 levels of renewable energy development.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a relatively small electricity demand by international standards with a peak demand of around 7,000 MW on the entire island.  It has renewable energy resources that are considerably above that level, consisting of onshore and offshore wind resources in the short term and wave and tidal resources in the medium to longer term, as those technologies develop and become commercially deployable.</P>
        <P>As the European Union moves towards more integrated European-wide electricity and gas markets, it gives us a real opportunity to develop new markets for our renewable resources.  Last week, I met with my counterpart in the UK, Minister Charles Hendry, to progress the development of renewable electricity trading between our two countries.  We put in place a formal process that will develop the necessary market, regulatory and technical issues and which aims to have a finalised memorandum of understanding in place by the end of the year.  This will create the access conditions that will allow our developers to access a significantly bigger electricity market.</P>
        <P>To summarise, while there are certainly challenges in developing new wind farms, there is a lot of work being done to overcome these.  As Europe moves towards decarbonising its energy systems over the coming years, newer and bigger market opportunities will open up for developers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome that the Government has set ambitious targets for electricity generation from wind sources.  We are in a privileged position in terms of the huge potential for wind, wave and tidal energy off our west coast.</P>
        <P>As the Minister will be aware, Scotland is one the leaders in terms of wind energy.  It has set itself the target of not alone achieving total electricity generation from wind before the end of this decade but of becoming a net exporter of electricity generated from wind.  Does the Minister believe the targets set by Scotland, which apparently will be achieved, are achievable here and, if so, what would we need to do to promote this?</P>
        <P>The Minister will also be aware of the difficulties in terms of planning that have arisen in regard to the location of wind turbines to homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in was happy to support the Wind Turbines Bill 2012 introduced in the Seanad by Senator Kelly.  It is hoped that Bill will soon come before this House and will be passed here.  Would it be better to have bigger but fewer wind farms?  There are only seven wind farms in Scotland, all of which are located further than 2 km from any home.  Would it be better for us to go the route of having bigger but fewer wind farms, all located an acceptable distance from homes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Ferris is correct that Scotland is a European, if not a world, leader in this area.  Scotland, like Ireland, has propitious wind resources.  Its energy policy in terms of oil and gas is retained at Westminster.  The Scottish Government invests a great deal in the promotion of renewables, in particular wind.  I would be hesitant to stick my neck out and say that the targets set by Scotland can be realised here for a whole variety of reasons, some of them technical.  The Deputy will be aware that currently where the wind is best the grid is weakest.  We need to address this and in that regard have announced the investment projects linking Cork to Kildare and the west grid from north Mayo to the midlands, which is important to that area.</P>
        <P>We have been and are making good progress in this area.  We are confident, based on expert advice, that we can meet our targets from onshore wind.  As regards big versus small and so on, while there is a great deal of sense in what Deputy Ferris advocates organisations such as Meitheal na Gaoithe and other small developers who got involved in this area at an early stage would be aggrieved if the decision was made to exclude them.  However, I agree with the Deputy that we cannot have wind farms at every crossroads in Ireland and that some projects of scale onshore is the desirable way to go.  It may well be that the State companies, including Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, have a considerable role to play in facilitating that objective.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s point in regard to turbines, just as we do not want wind farms at every crossroads in Ireland, we do not want turbines unreasonably intruding on people&rsquo;s domestic residences.  The response in the Seanad by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the Second Stage debate on the Wind Turbines Bill 2012 was that while the study is not yet complete she would favour the introduction of guidelines rather than primary legislation to deal with that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>My point on larger wind farms is primarily from an infrastructural point of view, as I believe it makes sense because it would be far more economical.  It would also be easier with regard to the planning process and having them an acceptable distance from local communities and houses.  I would be very supportive of us moving to meet our targets from wind energy and other natural types of energy.  We should also focus on what Scotland has managed to do.  It has seven wind farms located 2 km from the nearest dwelling.  It has a target of being energy sufficient through natural energy and being a net energy exporter by the end of the decade, which would be a huge achievement.  I believe it would be achievable here also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I was in Scotland on Friday on this business.  I met the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth in the absence of the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism to discuss some of these issues in a side conference during the British-Irish Council meeting.  Earlier last week I was in London to meet the Minister of State with responsibility for energy, Mr. Charles Hendry, to agree the goal that by the end of this year we will have concluded a memorandum of understanding between the two countries that will facilitate the export of energy from this island to the neighbouring island in what ought to be a win-win situation.  The British Government needs access to renewable energy to help meet its targets, and perhaps for more substantial reasons.  Meanwhile we have the capacity to perhaps generate as much energy again as the country uses.  The total requirement of the island is approximately 7,000 MW and we have the capacity to generate as much again if we had a market for it.  We must have a market for it otherwise there is no point.  If our market cannot absorb it there is no point in generating excess electricity.  We had a very good meeting in London at which we agreed that by July the officials will have highlighted the difficult issues that remain to be dealt with.  The two Ministers will meet again in October if necessary and some form of intergovernmental framework or memorandum of understanding will be concluded by the end of the year.  There could be many jobs in this if we can develop projects of scale here and the renewable capacity exported.</P>
        <P>To answer Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s question on large and small wind farms, the State companies, including Bord na Mona, Coillte and the ESB, have been very innovative which ought to be acknowledged.  Deputy Ferris is correct and there are thousands and not hundreds of acres of cutaway bog and the facility to have developments of scale on Coillte land and this is very important.  However, I would not like to say to small would-be developers in the system that we will try to squeeze them out.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 120 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recent publication by the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture of its report on offshore oil and gas exploration.  I am aware the committee has invested a considerable amount of time in gathering information and discussing relevant issues.  I am sure the report will contribute to the debate on how best to maximise the benefits to Ireland from the exploration and production of our indigenous oil and gas resources.  The report is a detailed document.  It runs to almost 130 pages and makes 11 recommendations.  From my initial consideration of the report, I can see merit in a number of its recommendations.  I look forward to discussing it in more detail in the Oireachtas in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
        <P>In the period since the report was published, the recommendation that has attracted the greatest level of interest is that proposing that the existing tax rate applying to petroleum production should be almost doubled.  The report recognises there is a balance to be struck between maximising revenue to the State and incentivising companies to invest in exploration for oil and gas in the Irish offshore.  It goes on to recommend that the rate of tax applying to petroleum production in Ireland should be increased to between 40% and 80%, depending on the profitability of the field.  It seems that factors such as high oil prices and advances in exploration technology were key considerations influencing this recommendation.  Economic logic would suggest that such factors should encourage increased investment in exploration expenditure.  However, high oil prices will not make Ireland any more or less attractive as a location for investment, compared to other countries with oil and gas potential.  The principal factor driving investment decisions is prospectivity.  The perceived likelihood of making a new discovery is the most important factor influencing investment decisions.  Other important factors include fiscal terms, access to markets and ability to bring a discovery to production.</P>
        <P>While I look forward to debating all of the recommendations in the report in more detail, I remain to be convinced that doubling the tax rate would be in Ireland&rsquo;s interest.  I note that the report considered two other countries &mdash; Norway, which is a very successful petroleum producer, and Portugal, which has a modest production history more comparable to that of Ireland.  The report proposes that Ireland should move from a tax level that is broadly comparable to that of Portugal to a level more comparable to Norway, which has been one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world.  As I have said previously in this House, Ireland needs an increase in the level of exploration investment &mdash; in particular, more drilling &mdash; if it is to establish the true petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  The approach we adopt to petroleum taxation policy will have an impact on the industry&rsquo;s investment decisions.  I look forward to discussing the joint committee&rsquo;s report in more detail in the Seanad tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the publication of this report, which was commissioned to respond to the belief that there is widespread concern about the current taxation and licensing arrangements for gas and oil.  I certainly believe that when gas and oil are discovered and go into production, the people of this country get next to nothing from it, in effect.  In that context, the production of this report by an Oireachtas committee is a welcome development.  Although I would go a little beyond what is recommended in the report in a number of areas, frankly, the implementation of the recommendations made by the all-party committee would be a major step in the right direction.  The Minister should take them seriously.  One of the reasonable points made in the report is that oil prices are likely to stay on their current upward trajectory, which means that oil companies&rsquo; interest in exploration will increase over time.  Ireland is a relatively politically stable place compared to many of the other locations where exploration might be considered and is therefore attractive from that point of view.  Crucially, technological innovation in the area of locating and extracting gas and oil reserves has improved dramatically and consequently some of the obstacles that might previously have discouraged gas and oil companies are not problems to the same extent they used to be.  In that context, Deputies from all parties have recommended we should increase the tax take significantly.  I do not see why the Minister would resist this.  It is probably not so many years since he would have been one of those shouting loudest for there being a significant benefit to the public from our gas and oil reserves.  For that reason, he should implement these recommendations, as a minimum step towards ensuring the people of this country gain some benefit from our oil and gas reserves rather than giving them away to private companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the report and the work put into it by the all-party committee.  The Deputy can be assured I will take it seriously.  The Seanad has invited me to discuss the report tomorrow.</P>
        <P>There are eleven major recommendations, the common sense of some of which I certainly recognise.  I would like the opportunity to discuss this further and have already committed to agreeing to do so whenever the Whips can arrange a slot in the House for us to discuss the report adequately.  I have not had an opportunity to go into the detail yet, however, even with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  We need to sit down and go through the recommendations one by one, in some greater detail than opportunity has presented so far.</P>
        <P>Deputy Boyd Barrett makes a fair point about my position on this issue.  Regrettably, the hopes all of us had in the 1970s for significant offshore strikes have not been borne out; the performance has been very disappointing.  One could take an optimistic view and say the results have been very disappointing because of the inadequacy of the exploration and drilling activity that has gone on, with only a few holes a year being drilled.  I do not know why one would have a right to expect to strike gold at that rate of activity unless one was drilling off the shore of Norway.  For that reason, this Government finds itself in the position that in order to increase the level of drilling off our shoreline we must be able to incentivise those who can do it.  We cannot do it; we do not have the investment.  The talk was of a State development company but in these circumstances, at &euro;80 million on average per hole, we are not able to do that.  Neither are we able to compete with Norway where 78% of the cost of drilling a hole is refunded if the hole is dry.  Whatever happens to me when the digital switchover happens, I would be taken away to the funny farm if I were to agree to refund 78% of the dry holes drilled off our shoreline, given the performance since the 1970s.</P>
        <P>I point Deputy Boyd Barrett to the fact that the tax take in the most similar country to Ireland, Portugal, is 27.5%, with 30% in Spain and 34% in France.  That is the background.  However, I welcome the report and look forward to the discussions we will have in the House about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett, briefly, and then Deputy Ferris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>According to the figures I have from the Numis Securities research department report, France had a take of just under 50%, not 35%.  I do not know how to explain the divergence between my figures and those of the Minister.  There is a very interesting graph of the tax takes of various countries that shows us at the absolute bottom, with by far the lowest amount of tax take for our citizens of any country in Europe.  The table shows Ireland with its tiny 25% take; a percentage it does not even receive because private companies get capital write-offs.  At the top are countries such as Iran and Venezuela which take about 90%, with most countries taking somewhere between 50% and 70%.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>One might reasonably argue there has to be some incentivisation but, to use the Minister&rsquo;s phrase, we have gone to the funny farm end of the spectrum in that we are getting virtually nothing.  The arrangements are such that we stand to get virtually nothing for the citizens of this country from the current regime.  I do not see the point of that and clearly the all-party Oireachtas joint committee also recognises this.  What is the point in having drilling and production if we get nothing from it?  This report is an attempt to redress the balance in favour of ensuring the people of this country gain some benefit if there are significant oil finds.  I welcome the Minister saying we must discuss this in more detail and it is urgent that we discuss it early.  To take the experience of Corrib, we made a bags of it on every level, public consultation, environmental and in the terms given to the private oil companies.  We made a bags of it and must ensure we get it right this time.  That means shifting the balance towards the public interest and away from the interests of the big oil companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I was a member of the committee that drew up the report.  The concept behind it was to look at where we are and at the difficulties we have had and to try to address them.  We believed the best way of going about that was to look at where there were significant successes.  Obviously, Norway was, and is, a great success.  We made the effort to meet the Norwegian ambassador and a representative of the oil ministry of Norway whose contribution was invaluable in helping us to come up with the report we did.</P>
        <P>As will probably emerge in the debate, we recommended a minimum take of 50%, on a scaled version up to 80%, judged on the size of the discoveries.  Much has been said in debates throughout the years to the effect that the success rate in this country does not entice people here.  However, part of what we discovered in our deliberations with the Norwegian ambassador and the oil ministry representative is that one of the biggest discoveries Norway made was last year and which came about by a return to what was described as a &ldquo;dry hole&rdquo; that had been drilled previously, capped and left.  Those involved went back, drilled a further 20 metres and had the biggest slice they ever had.  I know from my own experience off the west coast of Ireland there are a number of potential finds that have been capped and left.  Perhaps at some stage people may return to them.</P>
        <P>Another significant point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>A question please, Deputy.  We are running out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;was communication and discussion with host communities and the benefits of having this.  We can compare that to what happened in Glengad and Rossport and so forth.  We gave a copy of the report to those people because they also contributed, coming all the way from Ballinaboy.</P>
        <P>They read the report and were impressed by the fact that there is provision for consultation and for having a forum in place into which the industry, the political side, the host community and the trade union side can feed to ensure proactively that any benefits derived will come to the people and that where discoveries are made there will be a dividend for people in those areas and a return to the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>The report from the joint committee deserves to be debated in the House.  I appreciate the Deputies have not pressed me for a definitive response to particular recommendations and I think that is the correct way to proceed.  We need to debate it first and this side of the House is very happy to engage in that debate and see where that leads us.  I do not come to it with a closed mind.  I note the record will show that at the end of his peroration Deputy Boyd Barrett qualified what he said by adding the words if there are significant oil finds in the future.  That is the point.  One must strike a balance between trying to make significant oil finds and scaring off anybody who is likely to drill for oil or gas.  That is the balance we must get.</P>
        <P>In response to a point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I advise my note, and it could be wrong, states that France applies a tax rate of 34.4% with no royalty payable.  That is my advice and, generally speaking, I have found my advice on this area from the Department to be good and reliable.  That is the big challenge that confronts us.  It relates to Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s question and the Deputy was obviously right.  Of course there ought to be a dividend to Ireland and to coastal communities, of that there is no doubt, but given that we do not have the resources to invest the enormous moneys we are talking about in terms of exploration and drilling, we have to attract in the companies that have that kind of investment.  It is a delicate balance as between what will get them here and what will scare them away.  The record so far has not been great.  Deputy Boyd Barrett said we have lost X or Y.  The position is we have lost very little because we have found very little so far.</P>
        <P>My predecessor, the former Minister, Eamonn Ryan, changed the regime in the Finance Act 2008.  He brought in a tax regime of 25% to 40% in 2008.  That followed on from a review of independent consultants.  I think it was Indecon which was commissioned in 2006 to do an independent review of the regime applying.  The regime has changed enormously from the early 1970s.  Going back to the old 1960 Act, nothing redounded to the State and that came from a culture at the time where everybody who went to school before 1960 was taught that there were no mineral resources of any kind in this country.  Then we had some significant onshore lead-zinc finds and so on.  As a result, what was proposed by the then Minister, Justin Keating, was implemented in the mid-1970s.  That was rolled back in the 1980s because of the very poor uptake.  There was a further easing of the situation in the 1990s.  It did not produce results and then there were the changes introduced by the then Minister, Eamon Ryan, in 2008.  Deputies Ferris and Boyd Barrett are saying that it is time to look at it again.</P>
        <P>I repeat that I will be dealing with this subject in the Seanad tomorrow.  I do not know whether it is possible for the Whips between now and the House rising to debate the report from the committee but, in any event, we are not likely to strike oil over August, so we will be here in September and I will be very happy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <QRef>[30305/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>There is a commitment in the programme for Government to co-invest with the private sector and commercial semi-State sector to provide next generation broadband customer access and associated fast speeds to every home and business in the State.</P>
        <P>The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which I launched on 2 May last, and which I chaired with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, will have an important role to play in this regard.  The taskforce comprised the CEOs of ten broadband services providers.  The industry participants included the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.</P>
        <P>The specific purpose of the taskforce was to create a forum at which key industry stakeholders could highlight the legislative, policy and regulatory levers to facilitate greater commercial investment in high speed broadband networks across the country.  It was also designed to identify where regional gaps in public access to next generation broadband infrastructure and services are likely to occur between now and 2020.</P>
        <P>The report notes that by 2015, 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services, with speeds at or exceeding 70 megabits per second.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across the country, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.  The report proposes 50 or so recommendations or requirements which could enable broadband infrastructure providers to accelerate and maximise commercial investment in new next generation broadband infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In launching the report I also commenced a public consultation to allow all other interested parties to comment on the document and to offer any additional or alternative proposals.  The public consultation closed in early June and more than 50 responses were received.  My Department is currently considering the responses received and related issues.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>Building on the work of the taskforce and the responses received, it is my intention to bring proposals for a national broadband plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed services on a national basis which will take due account of the NGBT report and the additional responses received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that the plan is to cover 70% of the population but that is about 13% of this country&rsquo;s land mass and that leaves a huge number of people, especially in smaller towns and rural areas, without a decent broadband service.  Currently, only about 66% of people in the Border region have access to the Internet whereas the national figure is more than 80%.  There is already a significant differential in that regard.  Would the Minister not agree that compounding that problem is the backhaul speeds from the regions in terms of Internet access?</P>
        <P>Why was a recommendation not made on the five State owned fibre cable networks that should be brought together under the control of one semi-State body to wholesale fibre capacity for the country as a whole?  Why did this group bottle that particular recommendation and refer to establishing a one stop shop?  Why is EirGrid now planning to roll out electricity network high tension cable across the country but not include broadband fibre as part of that to ensure the peripheral regions have access?  Will the Minister not agree that without the broadband fibre infrastructure being put in place those communities will never have the high speed access enjoyed by their relatives in urban centres?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Naughten has a long-standing concern and a great deal of knowledge about the issues he raises.  I do not think it is reasonable for him to ask why the next generation broadband task force bottled it, as he put it.  It is, after all, comprised of the chief executives of the leading telecommunications companies who themselves are competing to provide a service where it is profitable for them to do so and, therefore, I am not sure that they would look kindly on the creation of a major State conglomerate that would roll together the five fibre suppliers to be created in the fashion he proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I hope the Minister does not pull it down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>The report concluded that 50% of the population will, by 2015, have access to as high a speed of broadband as anywhere in Europe, amounting to 70 megabits or more.  The report suggests a second tier which could be anywhere between 20% and 35%.  The exact size of the second tier is an issue which is much disputed and debated.  However, that second tier will have access to speeds of 30 megabits by 2018.  The third tier depends for its size on the size of the second tier.  It could be that between 15% and 30% of the population will only have basic broadband and this is the issue that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I advise Deputy Naughten not to confuse the report of the next generation broadband task force, comprising senior officials from my Department and the chief executives of the telecommunications companies, with the broadband plan which I will bring to Government before the summer recess as a national broadband plan endorsed by Government.  I am not saying it will be identical in all respects and I made this plain at the outset of what was a very valuable partnership process with the industry to identify the bottlenecks and the regulatory, legal and other impediments in the way of better commercial investment in the broadband sector.</P>
        <P>There is significant ongoing investment of the order of &euro;500 million per annum and competition is fierce in the more populous areas of the country.  The problem, as Deputy Naughten identifies, is that in less populous areas of the country, the prospect is of having to live with basic broadband and this is a market failure.  It is accepted, I think, that in areas of market failure, the Government has to intervene and therefore, I can inform Deputy Naughten that it is my intention to have Government intervention.  I do not rule out some of the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions.  Interesting, innovative solutions are arising all the time which improve the connectivity.  I refer to the considerable success of e-net and its management of the metropolitan area networks.  Virtually all the MANs are now lit, which was not the case even a year ago when almost 50% of them remained unlit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I call Deputy Naughten to ask a brief supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
        <P>I accept the chief executive officers of the main telecommunications companies do not wish another semi-State company.  I suggest the establishment of a semi-State company which would wholesale fibre capacity.  There are five State-owned fibre networks and if these were amalgamated, this would provide a key back bone structure.  I ask the Minister to consider this suggestion.  This would allow fibre to be brought to more peripheral parts of the country.  Without the basic fibre infrastructure, these communities will never be able to have high speed broadband access.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to intervene with EirGrid to ensure that when it is rolling out the high-tension cables across the country, it would include unlit fibre which could be accessed by this new semi-State holding company so that these communities benefit from access to high speed broadband rather than just having to look at these pylons as they go across their communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not have any difficulty in talking to EirGrid but it is my intention to enhance the quality of connectivity long before the transmission between north Mayo and the midlands and between Cork and Kildare is rolled out.  It is interesting that 53 organisations have responded with their criticisms and recommendations and suggestions for improvement, some of which are very interesting.  I am studying these submissions.  I have no objection to the particular recommendation which Deputy Naughten presses on me in respect of fibre roll-out and the capacity of the State sector to make a contribution.  However, it is not me he should be worried about but rather it is competition in the European Union and the undoubted probability that it would invite complaint from some of the leading telecommunications companies if one were to be less than subtle in how one would manage to create a State capacity along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  It is undoubtedly the case that the chief executives of the telecommunications companies operating in this jurisdiction have invested a great deal in the broadband task force and the quality of the interaction was immensely valuable as a result of which we are in a much better position to agree a road map for further provision of high speed connectivity.  A number of innovative initiatives are being contemplated which will greatly improve the level of connectivity in the State.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to address what has been a significant burst of incoherence from the Government over the past number of days and weeks.  We have been bombarded with different messages from various Ministers on very fundamental issues.  The comments of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on the need to defer public sector increments and the need for compulsory redundancies in the public sector, contrast very sharply with the comments of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on how the Croke Park agreement was working and which he articulated clearly.</P>
        <P>I refer to yesterday&rsquo;s leak to <i>The Irish Times</i> of correspondence between the Minister, Deputy Howlin and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, urged the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to take immediate action on the &euro;200 million overrun in the health service.  He wants the Minister to, &ldquo;personally engage&rdquo;, in the situation and to endeavour to manage it better.  He proclaimed to have serious concerns about activities in the Department of Health.</P>
        <P>I refer also to the refusal of other Ministers to rule out income tax hikes or welfare cuts, as in the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s, no red lines for the budget.  There was also today&rsquo;s rushed press conference, which was clearly organised to try to deflect from the incoherence and mixed messages of the Government but, from the early responses to that, it appears to have only added to the mess and the lack of direction and clarity.  That was in respect of the personal insolvency Bill.</P>
        <P>All of this has caused surprise.  Only last May the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said the economy was doing much better this year than last year, and all the announcements were that revenue was ahead of Exchequer targets and so forth.  I have two fundamental questions for the Taoiseach.  Will the Croke Park agreement be honoured by the Government, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, must personally engage and take immediate action on the overspend in the Department of Health?  How does the Government plan to protect front line services in the health sector to the end of the year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I note the Deputy referred to a &ldquo;burst&rdquo; of incoherence.  That word is very important to the Deputy&rsquo;s party.  I recall one of its members saying on television that somebody would burst the party asunder.  I am sure that is still stuck in the Deputy&rsquo;s memory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The word was &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, not &ldquo;burst&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>It will be challenging and difficult to draft the budget for 2013.  The target is to have the deficit down to 7.5%, which means a reduction of &euro;3.5 billion, with &euro;1 billion coming from tax and &euro;2.5 billion on the other side.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Croke Park agreement, the Deputy is aware that the Government has received the independent analysis of that agreement.  The Government will meet with the implementation body to discuss the report and its findings.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance will examine the Croke Park agreement and this report as part of their analysis of how we approach the preparation of the budget for 2013.  That budget will be presented by the Minister for Finance in December.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about Ministers needing to engage, this is a requirement for every Minister.  The letters that were published were the result of a freedom of information request.  It is a requirement and responsibility for every Minister to engage, in so far as their Department is concerned.  Deputy Martin will be aware that the Government has set its target for spending for the next three years, including ceilings, and every Minister is required to live within the agreed ceilings.  From that point of view, the Government will start the process in due course of preparing for the budget.  As I said this morning, that budget will not be drafted in public.  The Cabinet will conduct its deliberations and make its decisions in respect of what will be a very challenging position for 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>There is a serious lack of direction emanating from the Government.  There is no clarity on a range of issues.  People want direction and need clarity.  I asked the Taoiseach a simple question about whether the Government would honour the Croke Park agreement, but he was unable to answer it.  He said Ministers would look at the report.  The Government is either going to honour it or not.  One can argue the merits or demerits but the Taoiseach is failing to provide clarity.  As one of the union representatives, Mr. Ronayne, said this morning, there is a great deal of kite flying taking place.  A sum of &euro;8 means a great deal for many low paid public servants.  Those people would like some clarity, certainty and direction from the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Like we used to get from you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;-but they have no sense of that at present.</P>
        <P>At the press conference today, the Taoiseach was asked if banks would have the capacity to veto any arrangements, but he could not answer the question despite calling a major joint press conference with the T&aacute;naiste.  That lack of certainty and direction is undermining confidence.  What has been done in the past week or two by Ministers will damage economic recovery and consumer sentiment.  It will undermine the capacity of the domestic economy, in particular, to achieve some type of recovery.  It is time the Taoiseach asserted his authority in the Government and not have it undermined daily by Ministers who cannot keep their thoughts to themselves.  As the T&aacute;naiste so eloquently said this morning, every Monday morning when they wake up they feel disposed to articulate some view or other.  It is undermining the Taoiseach&rsquo;s authority and the authority of the Government, as well as its sense of clarity and direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I am very taken by Deputy Martin&rsquo;s concern for my authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>So are a few beside the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I gave a press presentation a short time ago.  Its purpose was to inform the media and the country that the Government has approved the personal insolvency Bill.  This Bill is highly technical and complex.  The explanatory memorandum for it is now being prepared by officials and the detail of the Bill will be published in full on Friday, when a full presentation will be given by three Ministers.  All the detail will be made available, rather than focusing on one particular element or another.  It is not a case of not wishing to respond here but a case of having the publication of the Bill and its presentation being carried out together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>We have been asking about it for a year and a half.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I disagree entirely with the Deputy&rsquo;s comment that there is insufficient direction or clarity in the Government.  In the past 12 months this country has moved from being associated with what was known as the PIIGS &mdash; Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain &mdash; group to a very different position.  International commentary from business, politics and economists sees Ireland and its Government, working with the people in difficult and challenging positions, to be moving solidly in the right direction.  That is reflected by the continuous and strong investment decisions being made by foreign investors, and is reflected again today in further decisions.</P>
        <P>The Government and I will accept our responsibility.  The Deputy denied all responsibility when he had a position of authority, and said so when it cost elderly people serious money.  In respect of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
        <P>What is the Taoiseach talking about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>It was when the Deputy was Minister for Health and had no responsibility for anything.  He produced 130 reports that lay on shelves gathering dust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach should answer the question he was asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>As far as the Croke Park agreement is concerned, the agreement runs to the end of 2013.  We want it to be implemented in full and as speedily as possible.  I have said that on many occasions, as has the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach honour it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The report was commented on independently quite recently, which indicated the savings, changes in structure and rosters, redeployment of personnel and movement of public servants out of the public service.  We want that report to be implemented in full as speedily as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <P>The agreement is being honoured.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes, but will it be fully honoured?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The agreement is part of the process of the preparation for the budget, and responsible Ministers have a duty to reflect on the independent report and on the figures as we move forward in that preparation.  Both Ministers will come before the Government in due course and the Government will do its work, as it is required to do under the Constitution and under the mandate it has.  The Croke Park agreement is part of that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>An Teachta Martin misses the main point.  It is not about the incoherence of the Government Ministers.  There is much incoherence but that is a given.  However, for all the apparent disagreement, the Labour Party and Fine Gael Cabinet is fully in agreement that &euro;500 million should be cut from social welfare payments.  At the same time, senior bondholders will be paid.  This week another &euro;1.14 billion worth of bonds, formerly held by Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank, will be paid.  For all the incoherence in the media this morning, the Cabinet will pay over &euro;5.98 billion.  That is more than the &euro;500 million it plans to take from citizens who receive social welfare.  T&aacute; na ciorcail &oacute;rga ag obair go han-mhaith agus t&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr ag cuid de na daoine, ach is iad na daoine eile at&aacute;&aacute; iompar.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is fair, as the Government plots and conspires among itself, to increase taxes and take money from social welfare recipients while at the same time he is paying over so much money to those golden circles?  Will he give a clear commitment now that he will stop doing that because that will sort out all of the problems?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>T&aacute; a fhios maith ag an Teachta c&eacute;ard at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas seo &oacute; thaobh iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag f&aacute;il airgid &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; leasa sh&oacute;isialaigh de.  Cuireadh cosaint&iacute; i bhfeidhm maidir leis na h&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; sin anuraidh agus sin a bh&iacute; i gceist i bplean an Rialtais.  T&aacute; a fhios maith ag an Teachta freisin go dt&eacute;ann r&eacute;im agus cusp&oacute;ir an ECB trasna chuile t&iacute;r san Eoraip agus sa eurozone. Mar sin, n&iacute; bhaineann an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag an Teachta le &Eacute;ire amh&aacute;in, ach le chuile t&iacute;r sa eurozone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>Ar&iacute;s, n&iacute;or thug an Taoiseach freagra soil&eacute;ir ar an cheist a chur m&eacute; air.  It is very simple in whatever language we speak.  The Taoiseach is paying out billions of euro to bondholders while planning to take money from those who can least afford it, and to increase taxes.  The Taoiseach stated in his programme for Government that he would not cut welfare rates or increase taxes but I see it every day in my constituency of Louth, as, I am sure, does every Teachta D&aacute;la.  I ask him to give us a clear commitment today that he will stop paying these bondholders, that he will put the money into investment in jobs and essential projects and that he will not make the ordinary working people, and the working poor, pay for the elites.  The unfairness of this Government, and the Labour section of this Government, is that he is asking the working poor, people on welfare and a range of other citizens who did not cause the crisis, to pay the burden while the Taoiseach pays out their money to these golden circles.  He is doing it today but he should not do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>What Deputy Adams is asking is that the country should default, which would be a disaster and a catastrophe economically for us and for every person living here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
        <P>It is a disaster already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not subscribe to that view.  This country has always paid its way.  The Government has made it perfectly clear that what we want in respect of the bank debt situation is a re-engineering of that to a longer-term lower interest rate, which would be of great benefit to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
        <P>The bondholders will get paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government is planning a real impetus in respect of lessening the burden on work and unemployment, improving the opportunities for people to get jobs and an investment programme which has been renegotiated in part by both Ministers with the troika whereby, when the Government decides to sell elements of State assets at the appropriate time, the proceeds of that can be used in the main for investment in sustainable employment and in job creation for our young people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams makes the point that the Government is planning to cut social welfare and to increase taxes.  I remind the Deputy that the programme for Government is very clear on that matter, and the programme for Government has not changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach is paying &euro;1.14 billion to bondholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>Reports that the Taoiseach has told the Cabinet not to speak publicly about sensitive budget issues must be welcomed, although I would have thought they would not know much about it because that budget will be written in Berlin by the Bundestag.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the reports nevertheless.  The important matters, which are a matter for the discretion of the Government, have been addressed by Cabinet Ministers in recent days and I particularly want to follow up the question about the Croke Park agreement in a specific way.  The issue of increments in the public service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>It is important for one reason, although not that increments are necessarily a bad thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>It is a bone for Finian.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm if it is true that those increments are being paid to people at the very top end of the public service?  Are people earning six figure sums of over &euro;100,000 a year being paid that amount?  If that is the case, that is an argument in itself for a reopening of the Croke Park agreement because it is unfair.  I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge that people being paid so much at this time of austerity should not be gaining so much when people at the bottom of the scale are being considered as a target for cuts and public service cuts in the budget.</P>

        <P>The position in so far as increments are concerned is that 70% of those in the public service who receive increments are in the middle to lower end of the public service.

        <P>The Deputy referred to reports from the Cabinet.  I never comment on what happened at Cabinet meetings but there are reports that the Deputy is considering the position in so far as his new constituency is concerned.  The Croke Park agreement runs until 2013.  Independent analysis of that showed up favourably in respect of it being implemented as far as roster changes, redeployment and movement of personnel out of the public service was concerned.  It will form part of the analysis and preparation for the budget for 2013 when both Ministers report to Cabinet.  I intend to meet with the public service unions, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the near future in regard to the Croke Park agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>I want to reassure the Taoiseach that I will not be moving constituencies; I will leave that to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, Deputy White and any others who want to take that course of action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
        <P>Could the Taoiseach assure the House that those public servants at the top end who are on six figure sums &mdash; &euro;2,000 a week or less &mdash; should be considered and targeted if they are receiving those sort of increments?  He should certainly give consideration to those at the lower end who are getting increments but could he assure the House that those people who are getting so much money at times of austerity will be targeted and will have it removed when the review of the Croke Park agreement comes up?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I will bear the Deputy&rsquo;s comments in mind but as I understand this those at the very top do not get increments.  There may well be those who are in line for promotion instead of long service increments in some sectors but I will take note of what the Deputy said in respect of the issues we will discuss when we meet with the implementation group.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government established the following Cabinet committees, all of which I chair: economic recovery and jobs; social policy; climate change and the green economy; European affairs; economic infrastructure; Irish and the Gaeltacht; public service reform; health; and mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P>Since January I have chaired 26 committee meetings.  In January, I chaired meetings of the committees on economic recovery and jobs and European affairs; in February, the committee on health; in March, the committees on European affairs, public service reform, health and mortgage arrears; and in April, the committees on economic recovery and jobs, social policy and mortgage arrears.  In May, I chaired meetings of the Cabinet committees on climate change and the green economy, social policy, European affairs, economic recovery and jobs, mortgage arrears and health.  So far in June, I have chaired the committees on Irish and the Gaeltacht, mortgage arrears, economic infrastructure, economic recovery and jobs, public service reform, social policy and European affairs.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet committee on climate change and the green economy last met on 2 May and will meet again in due course.  There have been six meetings of the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears since it was established in March, the last of which took place yesterday evening.  I chair this committee and its members include the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, the Environment, Community and Local Government and Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 22 May.  I have chaired two meetings of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs since the Easter recess.</P>
        <P>The Economic Management Council, EMC, was established with the same status as a Cabinet committee.  It has met 21 times this year: eight times since the Easter recess and 13 times since March.  I chair the EMC and its membership consists of the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The members of the EMC will meet with the banks later this evening.  At the meeting the members will set out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to assisting those in mortgage arrears, and provide details of the strategy, which the T&aacute;naiste and I announced earlier this afternoon, to address the mortgage arrears difficulties.  The members of the EMC will also take the opportunity to seek assurances from each of the banks that they are fully committed to addressing the mortgage arrears of their customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
        <P>Did I hear just one reference to justice and equality with regard to the Cabinet committees?  Is the Taoiseach saying there is no Cabinet committee on justice and, if there is, it certainly has not met this year?  I put forward this question approximately three months ago following the horrific, alleged gangland killing of two young men whose bodies were discovered in County Louth and the ongoing disaster of gangland killings and the death, for example, of Melanie McCarthy-McNamara and others.  Is this situation of concern to the Taoiseach?  There has also been an explosion in other areas of crime, such as burglaries.  As the Taoiseach is aware, from my colleague Deputy Conaghan, there is between a 4% and 8% chance of being caught for a burglary or from a 92% to 96% chance of getting away with it.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about this?</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister for Justice and Equality has brought forward some useful and good legislation and has had some good consultation with the public on a number of criminal areas.  However, is he up to getting to grips with the serious matter of crime in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy is straying a bit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the Economic Management Council.  There have been massive cutbacks in the area of justice.  Almost 400 garda&iacute; have retired and we are heading towards having only 13,000 garda&iacute;.  We have lost 300 patrol cars and 30 Garda stations and ten stations, including a number in my constituency, are only open in the daytime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is a matter for the Department.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy should restrain himself, please.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is whether there is a Cabinet committee on justice and defence but he has gone a long way beyond that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes, but I am in an unusual situation and just want to ask these questions.  Is there a committee?  Is the Taoiseach concerned about the situation?  What is he doing about it and is the Minister delivering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is a matter for the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>There is no specific Cabinet sub-committee on the area of justice.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality reports to Cabinet on a regular basis.  He is in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner and with the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  I deplore any attack, provoked or unprovoked, on anybody in the country, and we have seen too many of these attacks over the years.  In recent days there have been a further number of tragic incidents and I share the Deputy&rsquo;s views on such situations.  However, the changed rosters that have been introduced in respect of Garda activity are very beneficial for communities.  I meet people from all over the country who recognise the impact of those changes.</P>
        <P>I agree there are difficult decisions to be made in respect of the closure of a number of Garda stations.  When I speak to communities, whether in towns or the country, what people want is visibility, a connection and access to garda&iacute; when they need them.  In many cases, having a garda sit for two hours in a decrepit building in the back end of somewhere is less beneficial than having garda&iacute; move about a community actively and visibly where people can have access to them.  The changed rosters introduced for garda&iacute; in that regard are valuable.  There is an issue with regard to capital allocation in respect of the fleet and the provision of vehicles for garda&iacute; to do their job.  There are requirements for vehicles to be replaced after a certain mileage.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner will address the capital requirement as part of their budgetary process.  There is no specific Cabinet sub-committee on justice, but the Minister reports regularly to Cabinet on issues as they arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I have approximately eight questions submitted on this, but I will focus on just three areas.  With regard to the Cabinet health committee, is the Taoiseach satisfied with the methodology and efficacy of the system in place at Cabinet level in terms of the evolution of health policy?  A recent editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> highlighted the need for far greater clarity in terms of the direction of the health service and the need for public consultation.  It suggested a need for the publication of a White Paper or for the Government to give some sense of where we are heading with regard to health.  Despite all the promises over the past 15 months and despite the work of the Cabinet committee, which as indicated in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response has met on a number of occasions this year, no legislation is in the offing nor is there a precise timetable, as promised by the Minister, for further reform.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a sense of a drift in the health area, combined with a sense of dread and concern about the autumn and the capacity of the health service to get to the end of the year without serious consequences.  This dread relates to the overrun and to the complete lack of governance and management of our health service since the abolition of the board of the HSE.  Nothing has been put in place to replace that board.  Many of the senior people have left the health service as part of the recent redundancies and there is a sense of drift, concern and anxiety at hospital, community and patient level.</P>
        <P>With regard to the committee on mortgage arrears, will the Taoiseach clarify whether he believes it is having an impact on the significant issue facing thousands of Irish people, and couples in particular?  Over 10% of mortgages are now over 90 days in arrears.  By all accounts, despite the fact he has chaired a number of the Cabinet committee&rsquo;s meetings, the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer basic and straightforward questions about the issue at today&rsquo;s press conference.  He cannot answer as to whether banks will continue to have a veto over any resolution arrived at as a result of the legislative framework he signed off on today.  I wonder what goes on at the Cabinet sub-committee meetings if, over a lengthy period and a number of meetings, basic clarity that would give insight and information to the public cannot emerge on these issues.</P>
        <P>I put a question to the Taoiseach previously with regard to the jobs and economic recovery committee.  It has been suggested by some Ministers that the idea of the Cabinet sub-committee on jobs and economic recovery had marginalised the rest of the Cabinet with regard to economic policy and job creation.  The unemployment figure stands at 14.8% and the Government&rsquo;s prediction and that of the Department of Finance is for this to get worse.  The figures for the net employment gain over the next three years of have been revised downwards by approximately 40,000 jobs.  Therefore, some 40,000 fewer jobs will be created according to this year&rsquo;s prediction as opposed to last year&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>Clearly, things are not working in the Cabinet committee system the Taoiseach has put in place.  In the three areas I have mentioned, where Ministers have come together and meetings have been held, the situation is becoming worse.  This applies to the management of health, to bringing clarity to mortgage arrears and to decisive intervention in respect of unemployment and economic recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I completely disagree with Deputy Martin.  The Cabinet sub-committee system is working very effectively.  It brings about a focus on objectives set by the Government.  Ministers, agencies and organisations are given a high level of response.  For example, in the health area the programme for Government sets out the overall objective of the Government and what it wishes to achieve.  The work of the Cabinet sub-committee and the Cabinet follows towards that objective.  A great deal of work has been done on the HSE governance Bill, which is necessary legislation.  This morning the Cabinet approved for the Minister to draft legislation on the banning of smoking in cars containing children, who would suffer otherwise as a consequence, and on risk equalisation legislation for private health care which is also necessary.  The legislation to be drafted and produced in respect of health is extensive.  Suffice it to say that we want to achieve the introduction of universal health insurance and a single tier system, including a strong primary care and community care systems, where money follows the patient and where people are entitled to a health service based on their medical needs rather than the amount of money in their pockets.</P>
        <P>I made it clear today that questions of detail about the complex and extensive Bill dealing with the mortgage situation will be dealt with in full and at length on Friday.  Ministers will give their report on the Bill in its entirely.  The questions Deputy Martin or anyone else wish to raise will be dealt with.  We sought to avoid a situation today where, by answering one element of one detail, people would make a range of assumptions about what might or might not be in it.  This will bring great clarity about the Government&rsquo;s intention to radically overhaul the legal system by bringing about a first in Irish law in respect of personal insolvency.  It will also give a great incentive to banks to deal on a bilateral basis with certain borrowers to work out a solution while keeping the interests of the people at heart such that they do not lose their homes.</P>
        <P>This is not an isolated issue.  Deputy Martin will be aware that the Government published the findings of the Keane report and that it met the regulator and the banks.  The Government has required that they respond on the options, measures and facilities they intend to introduce for borrowers who are suffering from mortgage distress, negative equity and so on.  It is interesting that while these are challenging times, the majority of people are still meeting in full their mortgage payments.  The Economic Management Council, EMC, will meet the banks this evening.  I assume the banks will want to inform the Government of the measures they intend to introduce.  The Government will brief the banks on the approval of the personal insolvency Bill.  The details will be available on Friday when it is published.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Minister for Social Protection will continue to develop the website with information and advisory services in respect of mortgages.  This will provide people with information on where they can access assistance and the level and nature of assistance available.  This is also important.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin referred to the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs.  We published the action plan for jobs in February, containing some 270 propositions.  These are being monitored and overseen by my Department, where a special unit has been set up by redeploying people, together with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  The next tranche of the programme is due to be published inside a short time.  Ministers, agencies and organisations are aware of this and they have responded well so far and have made arrangements to have the relevant sections completed.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Martin that the employment situation is not as we would wish it; we would prefer if it were much stronger.  This is where the priority of Government lies and this is the reason legislation on partial loan credit guarantees is going through and the reason the micro-finance agency has been announced by the Government and by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is also the reason the Government is preparing an investment package, in so far as a stimulus can be put forward, to focus on this matter comprehensively and urgently.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin is aware that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform renegotiated the memorandum of understanding with the troika such that in respect of the sale of State assets whenever the Government decides to do so, the resource represented by a State asset can be used for investment and sustainable employment.  It has taken some time to get the structure right.  Everyone would prefer to see a greater take-up in the indigenous economy for the purposes of job and employment but this is where the focus of Government lies.  I assure Deputy Martin that Cabinet sub-committees operate to timelines, that they are achieving objectives and that a great deal of impetus and emphasis is put on this.</P>
        <P>Credit is due to the organisations and public servants who have worked exceptionally hard in respect of the personal insolvency Bill, a vast tome of legislation.  When Deputy Martin sees it, he will understand and appreciate the effort put in by those in the Department of Justice and Equality, other Departments and the officials in the Office of the Attorney General to get this right.  It will provide a clear incentive for banks and lenders to sit down with borrowers and work out bilateral arrangements in respect of which banks have been recapitalised and so that people will not lose their homes and a solution can be brought about to their mortgage problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Cabinet sub-committee system is becoming more about processes rather than about substance or action.  It is not about giving banks incentives to deal with people in mortgage arrears.  The banks have an obligation to deal with people in mortgage arrears.  They were recapitalised substantially and substantial funds were made available to help people in genuine mortgage arrears and to help people come through.  The fundamental point is that it is not one detail in one discrete area about which the Taoiseach was asked today; it is the central issue.  The role of the banks in all of this is central.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This raises questions about the efficacy of the committee system.  The Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears.  For some reason, either he had no wish, was not in a position or he could not answer the basic question put to him three or four times today on the role of banks in vetoing any solutions that might emerge from consultation under the framework of the personal insolvency Bill.  Why was a press conference held in the first place if there will be another one on Friday?  It is almost as if we are having a press conference about a press conference.  Perhaps it is deflecting from the different messages that have emanated from Ministers.  The Cabinet sub-committees are more about processes.  Are people really taking part?  I understand the Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet sub-committee on public service reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>If there are Cabinet sub-committee meetings on public service reform it is difficult to understand how we can get so many different messages emanating from Ministers when they speak publically on public service reform, that is on the Croke Park agreement, compulsory redundancies and increments.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has a clear view about the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport clearly has a strong views on the issues of compulsory redundancies and public sector increments.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is keen to deal with premium rates and overtime and so on in the context of the health budget.  Do these Ministers attend the Cabinet sub-committee on public service reform?  Surely, the idea and objective of such a sub-committee is to lead to coherence from Government on such issues as public service reform and such that people can argue the toss.  At least a clear message could then be sent to workers and the public that there is a sense of direction.  We do not have such a sense of direction emanating from Government at the moment due to this incoherence.  As far as I can see, the Cabinet sub-committee system is not adding value or authority to the work of the Government.</P>
        <P>In many ways, it is certainly not preventing extraordinary incoherence and fundamental differences in policy that have emanated from various Ministers.  Is it more about process than action?  We are in an unprecedented crisis.  It is no longer a matter of ticking boxes or committees going through a checklist.  The interventions need to be more dramatic and incisive, particularly in regard to the unemployment situation.</P>
        <P>It is striking that press conferences are arranged around the action plans for jobs and every small company that announces jobs but there was no press conference for the April review of the Department of Finance, which indicated that net employment would decrease by 40,000 jobs by 2015.  There would be uproar if somebody announced the loss of 40,000 from the economy but there was no press conference.  The information was buried in the Department&rsquo;s own review.  Forget the politics; this is a serious issue which needs to be addressed.  I do not think it is being addressed by the Cabinet committee or by the Government and the Oireachtas needs time to debate these issues in greater detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Before the Taoiseach replies I remind the House that questions relating to activities of individual Cabinet committees are not in order as those activities of the committees are subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  As a former Minister, Deputy Martin will be aware that has always been the position, which leads us into difficult ground when we have questions such as these.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Martin will be aware that the Cabinet has a constitutional responsibility to draft a budget and, as I have already stated, that budget will be presented in December.  We have made it clear that we are not going to speculate on the contents of the budget until the Cabinet makes its decisions on a range of activities.  Everybody in the country can have different views about these things but drafting the budget is the Government&rsquo;s collective responsibility as a unit.  Targets have been set in respect of the reduction to 7.5% for 2013 and the removal of &euro;3.5 billion between tax and cuts.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin made a big speech but it did not reflect the questions he originally asked.  He asked me the number of Cabinet committee meetings I attended in the past three months, the Cabinet committee meetings held since January 2012 and whether the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs has met recently.  I answered those questions and the other five questions were similar.  He then made a big speech about all the things that came into his head.  He asked whether the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs has met recently and when the Economic Management Council is meeting the banks.  That will be this evening and I have referred to it three times already.  He asked whether the Cabinet committee on European affairs has met recently, and so on.</P>
        <P>I have a fundamental disagreement with Deputy Martin&rsquo;s views.  These Cabinet sub-committees work to an agenda and an objective and, as far as I am concerned, they are achieving their worth and value.  The presentation given recently in respect of public sector reform was very extensive and outlined a range of achievements which I did not think would be possible in the time allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Say that to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Given the structure we have had in the public service for so many years, the activity is genuinely ground breaking.  There is a more streamlined and efficient public service for the people who pay their taxes and the people of our country.  Over the coming period I hope the impact of public service reform will be seen in the way services are accessed and provided and the way people are dealt with.  If the Deputy wants to raise specific issues in this regard I would be happy to supply him with the information he requests in so far as I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>Before I ask my question I wish to mention an issue which I and other Opposition Members have raised previously, namely, the fact that the Taoiseach is taking 23 parliamentary questions ranging from justice and defence, through climate change, health, mortgage arrears and Ulster Bank&rsquo;s crisis to the economy and jobs.  I tabled eight of these questions to tease out substantive issues.  I am not necessarily as interested in what was discussed in Cabinet meetings as in the issues arising.  I observed Deputy Martin as he tried to deal with a pile of issues.  It is not fair on him that he has to address these issues in a short space of time.</P>
        <P>I intend to deal with the issue of health now and if I have another opportunity I will raise further issues.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has demanded further cuts to health spending.  Figures recently released indicate that 158,000 patients have been waiting since January 2011 for an appointment to be seen by a consultant.  The Department of Health has signalled in its strategy that &euro;2 billion may be taken from the health budget by 2014.  Today, 313 patients are on trolleys.  How is the Government dealing with this ongoing crisis?  I realise we are limited in terms of asking about the issues dealt with by the sub-committee on health but have emergency meetings taken place?  Has the news that 313 patients are on trolleys resulted in additional meetings?  When will we see the details on the Government&rsquo;s plan for restructuring the HSE and the HSE governance Bill?  How do we deal with that?</P>
        <P>How will the Government deal with the aforementioned health issues?  How can the Opposition interact constructively with the Government to ensure our citizens get the best health service possible?  If I have the opportunity I also want to raise the issue of people in mortgage arrears and the fiasco in Ulster Bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Adams for the constructiveness of his comments.  The role of the Cabinet committee on health is to provide a basis for political oversight of the development and delivery of key health service reforms in line with the commitments set out in the programme for Government and to drive improvements in selected areas of priority.  It is not the way that it should be at this moment but a number of difficult structures have to be dealt with, as the Deputy will be aware.  The universal health insurance implementation group was tasked with assisting the Department of Health in drafting a White Paper on universal health insurance by the end of 2012, the approval of proposals for a risk equalisation scheme and legislation to be in place by 1 January 2013.  Today, following the Cabinet sub-committee on health, the Cabinet approved the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to proceed with the drafting of the Bill and it is hoped to have it enacted in the autumn, in time for 2013.  The special delivery unit became operational last December and was targeted with addressing the high numbers on trolleys in emergency departments and the numbers waiting for scheduled care.</P>
        <P>More recent developments that might be of interest include the launch of the acute medicine programme, which is a new way of working with patients who present urgent or emergency medical illnesses.  Its introduction across all acute hospitals in Ireland aims to save 500,000 bed days.  Legislation will also be commenced to eliminate restrictions on GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the general medical services scheme.  The Government has approved the heads of a Bill to formally abolish the board of the HSE and to establish a new directorate structure for the organisation.  The report of the review of the national children&rsquo;s hospitals has been presented to the Minister for Health, who is considering the next steps before bringing proposals to Government.  The Minister for Health is pursuing the public consultation to inform the review of the fair deal scheme, which has commenced and has a closing date of 16 July.  A great deal of work was done by medical personnel in respect of a number of local hospitals around the country where public consultation will take place with respect to the proposals for future development.</P>
        <P>Deputy Adams asked a question about what is happening in the health area.  The chief medical officer presented a report to the Cabinet sub-committee last week.  Some 25% of children under three years are overweight or obese.  We are facing over 250,000 type II diabetes sufferers, which could happen unless we do something about it.  Those in the current generation would be the first to bury those younger than themselves because of what is happening, most of which is preventable.  It is a combination of information, understanding and changing structures in order to have a beneficial impact on the health of the people in the country.  I found those figures staggering and frightening when one considers that a change of attitude, direction and emphasis can have a beneficial impact for so many people.  The cost over the course of a lifetime of dealing with one person who contracts diabetes is very high.  It will put a burden on taxpayers in the future but we can prevent it if we get the structure right.  The work of the Cabinet sub-committee is very beneficial and focused when we receive reports on what we can do.  I am sure Deputy Adams shares that view.  The question is in the line of what is in the best interests of the people.  When we receive this information, Deputy Adams can understand that we must take radical action to prevent the catastrophe coming at us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>I agree with the comments of the Taoiseach and his remarks about upcoming health problems, which are reflective of our lifestyles.  I will share my experience.  Recently, I wrenched myself very badly while cycling.  I went to the minor injuries unit at Louth County Hospital.  They did not have the facilities to deal with me so they put me in an ambulance and brought me to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, where I spent the night on a trolley.  I do not mind, I am not complaining and I do not raise these issues out of a sense of self-promotion.  It was a worthwhile experience for a Member of the Legislature.  Other people were on trolleys.  I was put into a cubicle because, obviously, they wanted to give me some privacy.  Elderly people were in a corridor and were very distressed.  There was one toilet serving a very modern hospital unit.  It reminded me of overcrowding in prisons I was in.  My admiration, respect and support for the staff was unbounded as they dealt with these issues.  I waited five and a half hours to be seen by a doctor.  I went in at 7.30 p.m. and was seen after midnight.  I spoke to people who had been waiting for seven or eight hours.  I was released the next morning but I was in Drogheda and my car was in Dundalk.  I had to return to the hospital for other checks.  Although I worked in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach may have noticed that I missed the odd session of Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  At one point I drove to Drogheda and was taken by ambulance back to Dublin.  I am sure I received the same attention as everyone.  Over the course of three days I was in three hospitals and two ambulances.  What was edifying was the professionalism and attention of the health workers at every level.  However, I also saw real distress.  I heard people tell me they had been there for ten hours.  Whatever progress has been made, that is the reality.</P>
        <P>I stand in the Chamber, as does the Taoiseach, and talk about these matters and it was by fluke that I was able to experience this myself.  I am not raising this matter for myself because, thank God, I am okay.  Other people do not have a voice and cannot articulate this point.  As we speak, they are in the same predicament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Adams looks fine and I am sorry he fell off the bicycle.  If he feels up to it, he can join me and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, for a charity cycle on the Ring of Kerry.  There is no disagreement about the stress, tension and imposition on people who must lie on trolleys.  I have had it in my family, like everyone else.  Deputy Adams points out the value and commitment of front line professionals in the way they do their business but also points to why the structure must be changed.  Change is always difficult to bring about.  Deputy Adams makes the point about ambulances transporting him here and there but there must be a more efficient method of dealing with patients.  Stepdown facilities, community facilities and the opportunity for people to remain in their homes for as long as appropriate will allow us to avoid sending elderly people to longstay institutions long before they should be there.  The question of restructuring the health delivery system for the future, away from what we had in the past, is obviously complex and tortuous.  This applies not only in Ireland but to all countries where change has been attempted for the betterment of the population.</P>
        <P>There is no argument about the stress and pressure people exhibit on trolleys and in distressed positions.  I am glad Deputy Adams has recovered.  The point he makes about front line professionals is accepted.  The point he makes about himself as a patient is obvious but the method of dealing with such cases should be restructured to give it greater effect.  There was a perception of catastrophe coming down the tracks when so many professional left at the end of February but it did not happen because clinical and medical teams and hospital personnel signed up to a plan or programme for each hospital.  They exhibited diligence and the capacity for change rosters and travelling distances for those redeployed in order to give of their professional services.  I accept that.  We want to get to a point where the service is effective and in the best interest of every patient.</P>
        <P>Over the years, I have been in so many wards and corridors, talking to people lying on trolleys having suffered an accident.  It is distressing.  The Minister for Health has set out commitments to reduce times on trolleys and to have it reduced to no time if possible.  There is a sense of achievement but it requires further work in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>What is the relationship between Cabinet sub-committees, individual Ministers and the Government?  With regard to the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs, for example, who makes policy on the economy, the public sector and public expenditure?  Does the Cabinet sub-committee make policy or is it the Government as a whole?  Perhaps it is made by individual Ministers on the hoof, including, for example, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  Has the Taoiseach given the latter a licence to shoot from the lip&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is a totally separate issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;demanding sackings in the public sector and cuts in the wages of low and middle-income public servants whose pay has already been cut by 15% in recent years?  Is it the case, by any chance, that the Taoiseach is going into a Cabinet sub-committee with Labour Party Ministers while having the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, fly kites for Fine Gael to see what further increments in austerity might be put on the shoulders of ordinary people as part of ongoing Government policy?  Is it proper that one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Ministers should join what has been a four-year campaign of denigration of public sector workers by certain newspaper chains&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is an entirely different question.  The Deputy is going on a different tack altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;which have disgracefully attacked and undermined them?  Is it appropriate that a Minister would lend to that, especially given that an OECD report in 2008 found that the public sector in this country was very modest in terms of the proportion of gross domestic product taken up by it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is a separate question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>I am interested in the chain of command and, in particular, the chain of policy-making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the relationship between individual Ministers, Cabinet sub-committees and the Cabinet itself.  The programme for Government is the agreed programme between the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party in government.  It is the programme that Ministers work towards implementing.  There are more than 500 commitments in the programme for Government and it is our intention to implement it in full.  I have already explained that in a small number of cases, it has not been possible to implement an issue because of constitutional or legal problems.</P>
        <P>Overall policy is set by the Government.  The targets for the reduction in our deficit have been set and agreed between the Government and the troika at 7.5% for 2012.  The ceilings in respect of spending, within which Ministers will have to live, were agreed by the Government last year.  The Cabinet sub-committees work towards objectives set by the Government, allowing for a far greater focus and effectiveness in ensuring those actions are taken.  The opportunity to interact on a much more concentrated level with public servants and public sector organisations working with Ministers helps to bring about results.</P>
        <P>Last week I presented 20 awards for public service excellence on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach.  These awards related to a range of activities, including achievements in Mountjoy Prison, by the Forensic Science Laboratory, by Naval Service personnel, in the area of education and so on.  These were brilliant examples of leadership in the public service by people who not only showed initiative and enterprise in recommending new methods of achievement in the public sector but actually put those methods into practice and, in so doing, demonstrated motivation and team discipline within their separate spheres.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet makes decisions about policy.  Ministers, working either individually or as a group, may bring single or joint memos to Government from the Cabinet sub-committees at which their work was completed and has been endorsed, for final decision by the Cabinet.  In effect, it is a method of focusing and emphasising particular areas of work and to allow Ministers to respond to the Cabinet committees chaired by the Taoiseach.  They are able to get that work done and bring those agreed memos to Government for final approval.  The Cabinet sets the overall policy, but individual areas are worked upon by Ministers, in accordance with their responsibilities, through the Cabinet sub-committee system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

This group of questions, which relate to the constitutional convention, includes questions by three Deputies who are in the Chamber.  The more time we spend on the current group of questions, the less there will be to deal with questions relating to the constitutional convention.  I am trying to be helpful in pointing out to Deputy Joe Higgins that his question has been answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
        <P>I have a brief supplementary question.  How does what the Taoiseach has just said relate to the actions and activities of individual Ministers?  Are Ministers in this Government free to make significant criticism by implication of Government policy?</P>

        <P>The Deputy has one question on this issue.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin had 13 questions and Deputy Gerry Adams had eight, or 21 out of the 24 questions between them.  I cannot allow Deputy Higgins to go on indefinitely.  In case he has forgotten, his question was to ask the Taoiseach the number of Cabinet committee meetings he has attended since Easter.  He has already answered that.  We cannot talk about the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.</P>

        <P>Yes.  My purpose in telling the Taoiseach my own little tale was to point out that the first hospital to which I went could not deal with me because it did not have the facilities.

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 35, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government published its proposals for the constitutional convention on 28 February and, on 7 June, we published our response to Opposition parties&rsquo; views on those proposals.  We will shortly move resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas approving establishment of the convention.  The Government intends that the convention will consist of 100 members, including a chairperson.  A polling company will be engaged to select at random 66 people entitled to vote in a referendum to be members of the convention on the basis that they will be representative of the population generally in terms of gender, age, social class and region.  The selection process will be overseen by the convention&rsquo;s independent chairperson.  Legislation will be required to use the electoral register in the selection and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will bring forward that legislation shortly.</P>
        <P>The remaining 33 members of the convention will be made up of Oireachtas Members and a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from each of the political parties in the Assembly which accepts an invitation from the Government to be represented on the convention.   While I have not met interest groups in regard to the convention, I am aware that several have signalled a desire to participate in its work.  Some, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, have made written representations to me.  Views have also been expressed that specific sections of society should be included in the membership of the convention, including vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised groups; children; persons from Northern Ireland, including, in particular, Northern Unionists; the diaspora; and Ireland&rsquo;s newest citizens.  The Government is firmly of the view that the convention should be composed of ordinary citizens and elected representatives.  It is not practical to accommodate as members, in a fair and representative manner, all of the groups or sections of society that have been proposed.  However, it is expected that interest groups will be able to interact with the convention, including by making submissions, and that the chairperson and members will be anxious to hear from a representative spectrum of opinion in carrying out their work.</P>
        <P>The convention will be asked to consider the topics outlined in the programme for Government, including giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish embassies or otherwise.  As well as specific topics, the programme makes clear that the convention is free to consider &ldquo;other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>To get the convention started, the Government proposes that initially it should look at two matters: reducing the presidential term to five years; and reducing the voting age to 17.  The convention will be asked to submit reports on these two matters within two months.  In that way, any necessary refinements to the convention can be made before it starts the rest of its work.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware that there have been calls for a more comprehensive work programme for the convention.  It is our view that the convention should deal first with the specific topics in the programme for Government.  The Government is prepared to consider whether other topics could be considered at a later date, in the light of experience.  I will consult with Opposition representatives and the chairperson of the convention at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>The convention will be independent in the performance of its functions and the role of the Government is to assist, as appropriate, in setting it up.  A budget of &euro;300,000 has been provided for the convention this year and staff are being provided from within existing numbers.  Preparations are continuing for the establishment of the convention and I expect that it will hold its first meeting in September.</P>
        <P>I should mention that I engaged in two rounds of consultations with Opposition parties on the proposed structure and operation of the convention.  Suggestions put forward by them are being taken into account in framing the resolutions that the Government will bring before the Houses shortly.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the Government recently published its response to the suggestions made by the Opposition parties on the <i>merrionstreet.ie</i> website.</P>
        <P>Finally, I stress that the Government has made public its commitment to giving a public response, through the Oireachtas, to each recommendation from the convention within four months, and to arrange for a debate in the Oireachtas on that response in each case.  In the event that the Government accepts a recommendation that the Constitution be amended, our response will include a timeframe for the holding of a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I call Deputy Martin.  We have seven minutes so could the Deputy put his questions in one round?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I appreciate that time is very short for such a substantive item.  I wish to remind the Taoiseach of the ringing declaration that the Fine Gael Party made some time ago when it said a Fine Gael Government would hold a referendum on Constitution day within 12 months of assuming office, in which the people would be asked to approve the abolition of the Seanad and other changes to Articles of the Constitution covering institutions of the State, principally the Executive, the D&aacute;il, the Presidency and the Judiciary.  Would the Taoiseach accept that we have come a long way from the lofty rhetoric that he so solemnly and determinedly articulated not so long ago?  From our perspective, that goes to the heart of the inadequacy of the proposal that the Government has put before us concerning the constitutional convention.  I do not believe the process the Taoiseach has embarked upon is comprehensive enough, nor does it have any sense of vision or definite direction.  </P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has said that the constitutional convention is likely to meet in September.  Many of the non-governmental organisations which have been interested in this feel there has been an inadequate degree of consultation with them.  They include the Irish Council of Civil Liberties and Amnesty International, among others.  People feel that the human rights dimension of constitutional reform should at least be considered by the convention.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach considered substituting the two issues he wants to initiate with the work of the convention &mdash; that is, reducing the voting age from 18 to 17, and reducing the presidential term of office?  They are not really fundamental or substantive in terms of the Constitution itself, and could even be agreed outside the convention.  Other issues dealing with the electoral system &mdash; or, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own words, the Seanad, Judiciary and the Executive &mdash; could be dealt with, as well as some human rights issues.</P>
        <P>In the existing Constitution we have universal access to primary education, but have we ever considered that in regard to health?  We have heard a lot about the new republic that was somehow to be encapsulated by a new Constitution, but we are nowhere near any of that now.  What has been proposed is underwhelming and there is no sense of a timetable, although perhaps the Taoiseach could outline one for me.  How does he see any changes that may be recommended by the convention coming to fruition over the next two years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the initiative to convene a constitutional convention and I especially welcome the opportunity to attend briefings the Taoiseach has organised.  However, the convention&rsquo;s scope has been limited.  During the election campaign, the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;Modern Ireland cannot be governed by a system of government originally designed for 19th century Britain.  Ireland needs more than piecemeal reform, it needs radical root and branch change&rdquo;.  I fully agree with that.</P>
        <P>Our society has changed because of the peace process in the North, the economic crisis and the revelations of corruption and all the other scandals.  People, therefore, are up for big, positive change.  There is still time for the Government to move this constitutional convention into dealing with the type of reform the Taoiseach has flagged up.  For example, my office has been contacted by an independent online youth organisation called Spunout.  It has raised a number of concerns, including whether 16 or 17 year old citizens will be involved in the process of lowering the voting age to citizens aged 17 years.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is only for six citizens under the age of 24 to be part of the convention.  All the citizen participation is limited to people on the electoral register, which means that those who are not on the register, for whatever reason, will not be able to have an input.  It also means that citizens from the North cannot have an input.</P>
        <P>Can this process be broadened out by using social networking and other methods?  Can we reduce the age to bring in young people?  It must be remembered that the constitutional referendum on the protection of children is coming up also, so we should let young people be heard in this convention.  Can we bring in people who are not on the electoral register, particularly those from the Six Counties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>To answer Deputy Martin, what I said originally was that from the date of setting up the convention, my intention would be to have a Constitution day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>No, the Taoiseach did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes, I did.  I said that from the date of setting up the convention, within 12 months one would have a Constitution day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>It was within 12 months of assuming office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Obviously, one has to set up the convention which has to do its work.  It is not from the date of the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach said there would be a Constitution day within 12 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Please, Deputy Martin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes, but clearly one has to set up the convention and let it do its work.  It has taken some time to get to that point.  I recall Deputy Martin speaking about French ministers having no further contact with the people at all, and that Irish Ministers could become full-time operators in this House and lose sight of the people, as the Deputy did when he was in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach is at sea again now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>It is clear that the questions of the Seanad and child protection are outside the scope of the convention.  This is because the two parties in Government, in respect of the programme for Government, stipulated that the question of the abolition of the Seanad being put to the people would not be a matter for the constitutional convention, but would be put to them in any event.  I notice the Deputy&rsquo;s own party seems to have changed its mind on that as well.</P>
        <P>In respect of child protection, as we indicated on a number of occasions, the intention is to hold that referendum in the autumn.  I will not name a date for it, however, until I am happy that all the bodies and organisations involved are clear about the issue involved and what the wording actually means.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I did not raise that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>That is being held outside the convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>We know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy raised the question of Amnesty International and human rights.  The very reason for choosing the questions of reducing the voting age to 17 and reducing the presidential term is to see how the convention is actually going to work.  We will select 66 people from the register of electors, representative of gender, location, regional spread, age and so on.  I want to see how it is actually going to work, so those two issues are ones about which one can give a clear-cut answer.  Does one agree with reducing the voting age to 17, or not?  In respect of the presidential term, does one agree that it should be reduced to five years in order to bring it into line with the European Parliament and local elections?  The T&aacute;naiste and I will review the convention after two months.  If weaknesses or inefficiencies are identified or if the convention is not working in the manner in which it is intended we will change it.  The Deputy stated that these issues could be agreed outside the convention.  However, they are constitutional matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Abolition of the Seanad is a constitutional matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>This will be a constitutional convention to recommend change.  One cannot agree outside of a constitutional convention to change to 17 years the age at which a person may vote.  That is a matter for the people by way of referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Abolition of the Seanad is a matter that could be agreed outside of the constitutional convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The convention may discuss the issue of human rights and so on.  It may also, together with the independent chairperson to be appointed &mdash; this is provided for in the document which perhaps Deputy Martin did not read &mdash; recommend other issues which it deems appropriate for consideration.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Adams&rsquo;s comments, I do not believe that the structure currently in place is fit for a modern democracy in 2012.  The programme for Government is clear on the scale of reduction needed in the Oireachtas and governance generally.  It is proposed to reduce the number of D&aacute;il Deputies, as per the recently published constituency commission report which proposes a reduction in the number of constituencies and Deputies.  This will be followed by a referendum in regard to abolition of the Seanad, which is also provided for in the programme for Government.  The Deputy will be aware of the initiatives being taken by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in regard to changes at local authority level, including in Limerick city and Limerick county, the amalgamation of Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding and other changes to be announced in terms of political reform, including back office services, shared services and a reduction in the overall bureaucracy around local governance.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware from the briefing that a facility will be made available to allow 17 year olds and any other person, at home or abroad, to make submissions online.  The same will apply in respect of citizens from Northern Ireland, Australia, America or anywhere else.  Those parties who are elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, including Sinn F&eacute;in, who wish to respond to the invitation to do so, will be able to nominate a person, separate from their elected representatives here, to attend the convention and reflect the views of the communities which they represent.  It is hoped the first meeting of the convention will take place in September and that it will respond on the first two issues by end November.  The Government undertakes to then examine those findings and to make a decision within four months on whether a referendum on the issues in question is required.  We will at that time know how efficient or inefficient the convention is.  If it is not working as proposed we will make changes as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their input into this and for the contributions made by the representatives who attended the briefings, including Deputy &Oacute; Fearghail on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

Perhaps, given the gravity of the situation, with more than 10% of people now in arrears of more than 90 days, the Taoiseach will tell us what the Government signed off on today and will set out a timetable in terms of publication of that Bill and its consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas, in respect of which I am unclear.  I understand that a further press conference is planned for Friday next to announce something else.  The language being used earlier was that the Government had signed off on something around personal insolvency legislation.</P>
        <P>Given the absolute need for a sense of direction in regard to our health services and the remarks by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the need for immediate action and for Minister for Health to personally engage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is a separate issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;when will the health governance Bill be published and considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy caught me out on that one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>That does not happen too often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>On the health governance Bill, on which a great deal of work has been done, while I expect it will be published towards the end of this session I cannot confirm that because there are a range of troublesome issues which need to be sorted out.</P>
        <P>On the personal insolvency Bill, the press conference today was merely to inform the people and media that the Government has approved the personal insolvency Bill.  I set out at that briefing a schedule of what will happen.  As stated by the Deputy, it is not a matter of ticking only one box.  This is a radical departure from anything that has been done before in terms of personal insolvency and the mortgage situation.  The Ministers for Justice and Equality and Finance and Minister of State with responsibility for housing will publish the Bill on Friday and will engage in a questions and answers session with interested parties.  They will also give a presentation on the complex detail of what is involved.  With the agreement of the Whips, I expect the Bill will be brought before the House as early as possible.  We may have to adjust our timetable and to sit later to get through Second Stage, to which I am sure everyone will want to contribute.  However, we can discuss that matter later in a rational fashion.</P>
        <P>I do not expect that the Bill will be implemented until at least the start of the next session.  It will not be possible to complete Second Stage quickly given the need to take all Members&rsquo; views into account.  I believe the best we can hope for, in terms of enactment of that legislation, is October.  However, much depends on the reaction of Members following publication of the Bill.  In addition, establishment of the personal insolvency advisory service will require the deployment and training of personnel from Departments to deal with the issues involved.  We will also have to develop a website for the personal insolvency and mortgage advisory service, which will be operated through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Minister for Social Protection, which cannot be done until the detail of what the banks are offering in terms of options and alternatives and full detail of the Bill have been explained to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that a presentation on the Bill will be made on Friday to the media.  Surely, that presentation should be made to the Oireachtas first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>It will be brought before the House next Tuesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Surely the Taoiseach can have it circulated to Members of the respective committee and spokespersons on finance during the next three days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I think people will want to reflect on it over the weekend.  There is enormous interest in this legislation.  I do not want people going off on tangents, assuming something is in it that is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The only people likely to do that are Ministers.  The Taoiseach should circulate it to Members of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>No.  That is why there will be a full presentation in the Government press office on Friday from the three Ministers involved.  I expect to bring it here next week when we will begin Second Stage.  I assure Deputy Martin it has taken an enormous amount of activity to get it to this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Again the House is the last to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>No, the House is not the last to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government promised change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>This is the publication of the Bill.  Deputy Martin will have his chance next week to speak in the House on it.  If we have to sit late during this month and next to get as much of the Bill through as we can we will do so, and we will need Deputy Martin&rsquo;s assistance in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Martin that it should come to the House.  I have read of many issues in the media before we have dealt with them in the House.  Perhaps the Taoiseach should invite all of the Deputies to the press briefing.  It might be another way to do it.  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Taoiseach as an bhfreagra a thug s&eacute; ar an HSE governance Bill.  Beidh a l&aacute;n oibre le d&eacute;anamh againn idir seo agus sos an tsamhraidh.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; ceist amh&aacute;in eile agam faoi reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; for&oacute;graithe.  I understand from what the Taoiseach said in the briefing that the constitutional convention to meet in September requires legislation to allow the electoral register to be used to select the citizens who will participate.  Is it envisaged that this will be done prior to the recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes.  The amendment to the Electoral Act is short and will allow for the legal official use of the register of electors.  The amendment was approved at Cabinet this morning and I expect to bring it before the House next week or the week after.  This matter will be concluded prior to the House rising for the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the customers of Ulster Bank who have been affected for the past week by the IT failure.  The timeline for the resolution of these issues keeps shifting and the matter is having serious implications for the more than 100,000 customers of the bank and perhaps of other banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>It is not really in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I tried unsuccessfully to raise it as a Topical Issue today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I think it is worth trying again tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I certainly will.  The Economic Management Council will meet the banks tonight.  Will Ulster Bank be represented at this meeting and if so will this issue be raised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is out of order on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I will certainly submit the issue again tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The Central Bank has responded with regard to its monitoring of the situation in Ulster Bank.  As Deputy Michael McGrath is well aware, this has been enormously stressful for people who either have not received their salaries or have been unable to meet their commitments.  I am aware of the shifting sands with regard to rectifying the matter completely.  I am not aware of what the actual problem was.  We will of course raise this matter with the representatives from Ulster Bank this evening.  I hope the matter can be resolved as quickly as possible.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, contacted the chief executive last Friday and obtained assurances from Ulster Bank that it is taking every measure possible to minimise the impact on its customers.  Deputy Michael McGrath is aware of the number of branches which opened for long periods at the weekend to allow this to happen.  People are also experiencing delays in social welfare and other payments.  I hope the matter is resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
        <P>With regard to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, is the Taoiseach aware that on 24 October, when Saorview will take over from the analogue system, in areas such as Lauragh, Bonane and Dromlivane more than 500 people will have no television service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Is this in the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
        <P>Yes, it is.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act contains a guarantee of service to people living in these areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Thank you, we cannot deal with the content of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach is very aware of these areas as he will be cycling around them very soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will not be able to see him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
        <P>To say something positive, I wish to thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to the fishery harbour centres rates and charges order 2012 for taking on board the representations I and others made on behalf of boatmen from Dingle who take people out to see Fungi.  To be fair, the Government took on board the concerns of the boatmen and acted accordingly and I welcome this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
        <P>It was Deputy Brendan Griffin who did this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
        <P>He knows about it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>A Fungi-ised response and I am glad the Deputy recognises it.  With regard to the change-over to digital there have always been complications in a small number of areas throughout the country and special arrangements will have to be put in place so residents in these areas will be able to watch their favourite television channels and programmes.  Such issues have arisen on a number of occasions over the past 25 or 30 years.  There are still some areas where there are great technical difficulties in receiving programmes.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is very conscious of this and special arrangements will have to be put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>The issue I wish to raise is similar to the previous one.  With regard to telecommunications legislation, mobile phone companies are being asked to buy out the rights to deliver services.  Will they be compelled under a public service obligation to ensure service levels are kept at least where they are at present and ensure all areas of rural Ireland have a mobile service?  It could be very detrimental to people if they do not have this public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>What legislation is the Deputy inquiring about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I am sure there is telecommunications legislation.  I am inquiring about a very serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Is there any promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I am probably winging it, but it is a very serious issue for rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I think you are winging it alright.  I suggest a parliamentary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnMaloney"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</NameTxt>
        <P>Is there any prospect of the criminal justice (corruption) Bill 2012 coming before the House before the recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>No, I do not think so to be honest.  The heads of the criminal justice (corruption) Bill were cleared last week and it has a distance to travel yet.  It certainly will not be before the end of the session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>What is the anticipated passage of the national vetting bureau Bill and when will it be signed into law?  I also wish to ask about the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which might go some way towards encouraging a debate the result of which might be to focus on the ability of ordinary law-abiding citizens to go about their business without fear of attack.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be later this year.  I expect the Bill in respect of vetting will be published prior to the end of the session but it will be the next session before it is enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>In light of the plight of some Irish holidaymakers overseas who find themselves without access to cash or credit as a result of the Ulster Bank debacle, has the Government issued any directions to the consular services throughout the world and has it provided appropriate financial assistance to families who find themselves in exceptional hardship as a result of this inability to access cash?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I do not think it is in order on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>I think it is, particularly under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill which is due before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That will be a bit late for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>There might be capacity to provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The people will be back from their holidays when that Bill comes before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>They may be, but a number of families are in a very difficult situation as a result of not being able to access cash.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Do not dig the hole deeper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>Has the Government been in contact with the consular service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>The Taoiseach has said he will raise the matter this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>Are funds being made available to people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to take note of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I have taken note of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I call Deputy Griffin and I hope he will not speak about Fungi.  We have already discussed him once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffinFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Griffin</NameTxt>
        <P>It is a fishy story.  I thank the Taoiseach for the progress made on the personal insolvency legislation which is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffinFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Griffin</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I welcome the fact that we will prioritise its passage by sitting later if necessary.</P>
        <P>As the Ceann Comhairle mentioned it, I was delighted to get the good news for the people of Dingle last Friday.  Deputy Healy Rae probably became aware of it this week.  The people of Dingle are very grateful for the good news with regard to the fishery harbour centres rates and charges order 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>That is great.</P>
      </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="European Council:" RHead="Statements"> 
    <Title>European Council: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>The important meeting of the European Council that will take place on Thursday and Friday of this week will have a full and significant agenda.  The main item for discussion will be economic policy.  The matters to be examined include the contents of a compact for growth and jobs and President van Rompuy&rsquo;s report on how to strengthen economic and monetary union.  We will also discuss the future budget for the Union &mdash; the multi-annual financial framework.  Under the heading of enlargement, we will consider the question of the opening of negotiations with Montenegro.  We will address a number of matters in the Justice and Home Affairs area.  We will welcome the work that has been done on nuclear stress tests on foot of the request we made in December 2011.  We will also discuss foreign policy matters, including the situation in Syria.</P>
        <P>The House will be aware that the European Council has met with increasing frequency since the economic crisis in Europe started.  During all of these meetings, we have sought to move Europe beyond crisis and into a phase of stabilisation, recovery and growth.  Our approach has not always been as balanced, ambitious or sure-footed as it should have been.  The crisis has continued.  It is clear, including from recent events, that we have yet to convince the markets that Europe is a stable and safe place in which to invest.  As a Union, our growth prospects remain low.  Too many of our people, especially young people, are without jobs.  As I have said previously, recent meetings of the European Council, especially those in January and March and at the end of May, have been much more firmly focused on how we can put in place concrete measures to engineer recovery, generate growth and support job creation.  That will be the focus of our work again later this week.  I will look for progress to be made on all fronts.  I will seek concrete steps to help us to stabilise the current situation; to get investment flowing in the real economy and thereby encourage growth and jobs; to prioritise policies, including in the Single Market and on trade, that have real growth potential in the short and medium terms; and to lay the groundwork for a more stable and deeper economic and monetary union.</P>
        <P>Our discussions on economic matters will centre around three elements: the conclusions we will adopt, the compact on growth and jobs, and the report we will receive from President van Rompuy on the building blocks needed to strengthen economic union.  The European Council will take the final formal step in this year&rsquo;s European semester in endorsing the country-specific recommendations addressed to each member state.  These will be reflected in upcoming decisions on budgets, structural reforms and employment policies.  As a country that is receiving financial assistance, the recommendation to Ireland is that we should continue to implement the terms of our EU-IMF programme as we have been doing to date.  Importantly, the meeting will adopt a compact for growth and jobs.  This is a welcome departure.  As the House will be aware, the Government has long argued that such a pact is urgently needed not just in its own terms, but also as a vitally important balance to the fiscal pact we adopted through the new treaty.  Just as we need reform and discipline, we also need an equally firm focus on growth and job creation.</P>
        <P>The compact contains measures that have the capacity to make a meaningful impact over the short and medium terms.  Most immediately, it proposes initiatives with the potential to deliver a boost to growth by injecting increased investment into the real economy.  It proposes an increase of &euro;10 billion in the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s capital, an amount that can be converted with leverage into an additional &euro;60 billion in lending, thereby supporting an additional &euro;180 billion in investment.  The compact also urges that we press forward with the pilot phase of project bonds, focus Structural Fund spending on growth-oriented projects, and bring the European Investment Fund into play.  All of these steps will make a positive difference, but they will not achieve the real results we are looking for if they are not fully accessible to countries where investment is most urgently needed.  Therefore, I will continue to make the case for the maximum flexibility and creativity so investment can be targeted where it should be.  I welcome the recognition in the draft text that the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s increased lending should be &ldquo;spread across the whole European Union, including in the most vulnerable countries&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The compact also calls for deepening of the Single Market, particularly in digital and network industries.  As the House is aware, the Commission is advancing work on the first 12 measures under the Single Market Act.  It will bring forward its proposals for the next phase in the autumn.  This will be a key input into the work of our Presidency in the first half of next year.  I have said many times that the digital agenda is particularly promising.  I expect that next week&rsquo;s meeting will call for swift progress on measures aimed at further developing online trade, including e-invoicing, e-identification and other electronic services.  We will also note the crucial importance of rolling out high-speed Internet, modernising Europe&rsquo;s copyright regime and facilitating licensing.  I hope it will be possible to reach final agreement on the patent, a file that has been open for so long it has become a symbol of Europe&rsquo;s capacity to act.</P>
        <P>The compact highlights trade as an important driver of growth.  In particular, it calls for efforts to be geared towards the removal of trade barriers, the facilitation of better market access, the creation of appropriate investment conditions, the protection of intellectual property and the opening up of public procurement markets.  As an open trading economy, Ireland welcomes this focus.  A priority will be concluding work on free trade agreements with Singapore and Canada by the end of the year, with negotiations with India to be given a new momentum.  The compact calls for a deepening of the EU&rsquo;s trade relations with Japan and looks forward to the possible launch of negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement in 2013.  This is something we will be working towards energetically.  The compact also refers to the potential of tax policy to make a contribution to fiscal consolidation and growth.  While I firmly support efforts at European level to improve the fight against tax fraud and evasion &mdash; I look forward to the Commission&rsquo;s action plan in this regard &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s position on CCCTB is very well known and will not be changing.  I know I have the support of the House on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>What is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I would be misleading the House if I did not acknowledge that some member states have not yet agreed to some elements of the compact, including the additional funding for the European Investment Bank.  Some member states believe the bank should first make better use of the resources that are already available to it.  There are concerns about protecting the bank&rsquo;s AAA rating.  In my view, these concerns are sometimes overdone.  While a top-class credit rating is important, its maintenance cannot be allowed to become an end in itself.  It is a means to an end.</P>
        <P>President van Rompuy has tabled the report on strengthening economic union that we commissioned from him when we met at the end of May.  His paper reflects the consultations he has had in the intervening period with Presidents Barroso, Draghi and Juncker.  He briefed Ministers on its contents at the meeting of the General Affairs Council earlier today.  The report is a welcome contribution to what will be an important debate.  It is worth noting at the outset that it is not, nor does it pretend to be, a means of addressing the immediate crisis we face in the eurozone.  It is an agenda and a roadmap towards a stronger economic union.  We will work our way through it over the months and years to come.  It should not distract us from the urgent steps that need to be taken to stabilise the markets.  In this regard, I believe the time has come to allow the European Stability Mechanism to fund banks directly, thereby taking pressure off Europe&rsquo;s vulnerable sovereigns.</P>
        <P>President van Rompuy&rsquo;s report contains four key elements &mdash; an integrated financial framework, or banking union as it has been called; a more integrated budgetary framework with commensurate steps towards mutual debt issuance; an integrated economic policy framework; and a means of ensuring the necessary democratic legitimacy and accountability apply.  There is a great deal in the report.  I recommend that people should read it.  It requires a great deal of careful study and consideration.  I would like to offer some initial reactions to it.  I welcome the recognition that we need to move towards more integrated financial arrangements, or &ldquo;banking union&rdquo; as it is called.  It is something I have long advocated.  We need integrated banking supervision and common deposit insurance and resolution mechanisms.  It will take a great deal of work to advance these ideas.  I would like to see an outcome where risk is shared to the greatest extent possible and where the burden of saving banks is removed from taxpayers.</P>
        <P>We have already gone a considerable distance towards greater fiscal integration, including through the six-pack and the fiscal treaty.  President van Rompuy is proposing a further tightening in a manner that is consistent with democratic legitimacy.  We will have to see the detail of what might be involved here.  It is important that he explicitly links progress in this regard with progress towards the future issuance of common debt.  The Government has argued for this.  The ultimate goal is eurobonds.  There are steps that can be taken in the interim, some of which President van Rompuy points towards in his report.  If we move forward, it has to be on both fronts, in step together.  I also support the idea of greater economic co-ordination, especially between euro area countries.  Towards this end, President van Rompuy suggests we build on what already exists in the euro plus pact.  Again, this is welcome.  The fourth essential element of the report is the need to ensure democratic legitimacy and accountability, an indispensable element in advancing this work.  We cannot move forward if the people are not with us.  In Ireland, we know this better than most.</P>
        <P>The meeting this week will offer member states an opportunity to give their reactions to what President van Rompuy has proposed.  I expect it will mandate further work and that the President will be asked to make an interim report when we meet in October, with a final report to come in December.  I very much look forward to engaging with my colleagues on this.  It is also important that this House is kept fully engaged and informed in the period ahead and I will brief Members on my return.</P>
        <P>To reiterate, working on this medium to long-term agenda must be supplemented by efforts to get to grips with the immediate crisis we continue to face.  The heads of the eurozone countries will meet over lunch on Friday during which time I expect some of the most immediately urgent issues will arise.  In a context in which market pressure has continued to mount on a number of member states, especially Spain and ltaly, I expect we will discuss whether there are steps that can be taken to better manage bond spreads.  A number of proposals involving the EFSF, the ESM and the ECB have been floated in this regard.  This will not be an easy discussion but it is an essential one and cannot be shirked.</P>
        <P>This week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council will also take stock of the progress that has been made on negotiating the Union&rsquo;s budget for the period 2014 to 2020, also known as the multiannual financial framework, or MFF.  The Danish Presidency has made good headway and has set out possible options in a draft negotiating &ldquo;box&rdquo; that will now be handed forward to the Cypriot Presidency.  I expect the European Council will express its hope that agreement can be found among member states by the end of the year, an ambition I strongly support.  There is acceptance that the new budget must make a strong contribution to jobs and growth.  The Government sees agriculture and agribusiness as a very important part of this picture and I will make a strong case in support of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>It is important that this week&rsquo;s meeting comes forward with a comprehensive and credible package which can address the immediate crisis and can set us on the right path for the future.  I look forward to the contributions from Spain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the other countries towards dealing with the immediate crisis of banking that afflicts the eurozone, evidenced most recently in the application by Cyprus for bailout funding for its banks.  I look forward to playing to a full and active part in the discussions at the meeting and to reporting to the House on my return.  I welcome the observations of Deputies from all sides along with their views as to the immediate steps that might be taken by Europe to deal with the crisis that now afflicts us.  Nobody wants to go through the summer and the autumn with continued uncertainty in the markets in respect of the eurozone and the euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>During this crisis a pattern has been established of leaders working feverishly to implement short-term solutions which unravel quickly and make matters much worse.  Yesterday, the fifth of the 17 member states of the eurozone applied for European funding because it could no longer borrow at affordable rates.  It is no longer possible for anybody to argue that this crisis is the responsibility of individual irresponsible member states.  It is a systemic problem and can only be tackled by urgent, radical and systemic reform, none of which appears in the agenda of the European Council.</P>
        <P>Preparations are under way throughout Europe for the departure of Greece from the eurozone so it appears to be already too late to save the euro.  The question now is whether a further and more dramatic escalation of the crisis can be prevented.  Can we stop a disastrous set of developments which would destroy the euro, wreak enormous economic damage and perhaps even threaten the European Union?  The social impact of a crisis which is already severe could become much worse.</P>
        <P>This rapidly evolving scenario can be halted but we can only do so if the leaders of Europe admit their failures and start to address the fundamental flaws in the design of the euro.  Unfortunately, the indications today are that Friday will not bring any major move forward and these indications have been confirmed by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address to the House.  At the core of this is the fact that there has been no real effort to build a consensus for reform among the broad base of member states.  Increasingly, our Government is taking a leading role in this failure.  When he was seeking a mandate from the people last year the Taoiseach wasted no opportunity to talk about how he had superior contacts in Europe because of his position in the European People&rsquo;s Party.  In the middle of the campaign he jetted off to Berlin to show how apparently close he was to Chancellor Merkel.  He promised that a diplomatic whirlwind of activity would engulf Europe if he were elected.  What is most incredible is that after a year and a half in office, and during a crisis that threatens even more dramatic damage, the Taoiseach and the Government have yet to say exactly what is their policy on Europe.  They have never produced a single document or speech setting out the reforms we want to see made to the EU and the eurozone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>I set them out in a letter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Instead, weak letters, in which the Taoiseach calls for measures that have already been agreed, are sent to other capitals before summit meetings.  These letters are then leaked to the media and solemn briefings are given about how the Taoiseach is pushing hard.  The current situation is that his overwhelming priority is managing the domestic media, with a whirlwind of empty photo opportunities for local papers.  The Taoiseach has reduced to a trickle the level of substantive meetings with foreign leaders and although every week brings news of a new series of meetings between other Prime Ministers, he has been content to opt out.  Just as with the promise &ldquo;not a red cent for the banks&rdquo;, the diplomatic initiative has joined the growing list of abandoned election promises.  No doubt the standard schedule of meetings which comes with holding the Presidency of the Council next year will be presented as a major new personal undertaking but nobody will be fooled.</P>
        <P>We have an excellent diplomatic service which has always done its job but missing today is direct political engagement in pushing Ireland&rsquo;s position to other countries.  The discussions should not be left to a handful of the larger states.  There is more than enough common interest between other states to take the initiative and table substantive proposals.  The time has come for the Taoiseach to put aside the timid approach of quietly going along with what has already been agreed by others and state clearly what this country believes in.  He must state exactly where he stands on the different proposals for banking and monetary, fiscal and political union.  The word &ldquo;fiscal&rdquo; was almost absent from his contribution today.  He must state what he believes is the minimum required to save the euro and return Europe to growth.</P>
        <P>One important change in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position was indicated in his office&rsquo;s leak of a letter to the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, which dealt with Ireland&rsquo;s bank-related debt.  For the first time since 2010, the Taoiseach admitted that our obligation to carry all this debt was a key factor in Ireland&rsquo;s being forced out of the bond market.  In the past he refused to make this case because it did not suit his partisan political agenda.  Now that he has taken this step he needs to go further, set out a clear demand and propose a set of actions we would take in the different scenarios.  Well over a year ago the Taoiseach told us a technical paper was being prepared &mdash; urgently.  The Minister for Finance went to Washington and handed out an exclusive story about the imminence of a new programme of burning unsecured unguaranteed bondholders.  This week, however, the bond redemptions continue unchecked and yet again the Taoiseach has stated that Irish debt sustainability is not on the European agenda.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has chosen to share no information about what is being asked so we are left to get information from other countries.  Ireland has laid down no tough negotiating position and has not clearly made the case that this debt must be handled differently from normal sovereign debt.  The ECB has publicly made the case that there is moral hazard involved in treating this debt more leniently.  In response our Government has failed to make even the most obvious arguments.  What about the moral hazard in letting reckless lenders escape untouched?  What about the moral hazard in telling countries that play by the rules they will not be allowed to benefit from subsequent changes in policy?  What about the moral hazard in leaders and institutions obsessively promoting an orthodoxy which has clearly failed?  What about the moral hazard in refusing to show respect for the view of all states within the Union?  With a large and secure majority and major movement on policies not available before last year the Government has succeeded in negotiating exactly nothing which was not developed for others first and then applied to all states.</P>
        <P>The point has long since arrived where our Government needs to set out a bottom line.  With an attempt at market re-entry not scheduled until late next year, we must set out a bottom line in regard to what debt we believe is sustainable.  It is clear from other capitals that they do not know what Ireland&rsquo;s basic need is and all they are hearing is that everything is on course.  If everything is in on course then why would they change anything in regard to Ireland?</P>
        <P>We should say unequivocally that, at a minimum, to return to the market successfully the remaining promissory note funds should not be allowed to become core sovereign debt.  They should be placed on lengthy terms which lift the extra burden being imposed on already tough adjustments.  The Taoiseach should cut out the vague generalities and speak directly.  To save the euro there must be a new approach.</P>
        <P>Today, as much as at any time in the last three years, there will be no relief from the sovereign debt crisis unless the markets regain confidence that they will get back money they lend.  Contagion has happened and is escalating.  There is little to distinguish Italy and Belgium from the five countries already unable to freely borrow and the borrowing costs of others continue to rise.  There simply is not enough money in place to show that governments will be able to finance their deficits and refinance their debts in all reasonable circumstances.  The ESM is a good development and, at a minimum, it must be leveraged.  This may break rules on monetary financing within the eurozone but surely it is better to change these rules than let them bring down the currency they are supposed to underpin?</P>
        <P>The ESM should not be used on the secondary bond market.  This would use up vital reserves and simply continue to provide an opportunity for investors to exit the market.  The interventions by the ECB on the secondary market have not contained the crisis and the involvement of the ESM will not do so either.</P>
        <P>As the growing reserves placed on deposit in the ECB and a range of other indicators highlight, the Depression-era evidence that more direct action is required has been more than confirmed.  We should not waste precious time and resources on a policy which has failed.  Instead of working to fund bailouts we should be doing everything possible to stop them being necessary.</P>
        <P>If the leaders really want to agree measures to tackle the crisis, they should also signal that they are willing to take a dramatic initiative to both fund urgent needs and show a credible pathway to long-term sustainability in public debt.  The mutualisation of debt in some form is inescapable.  At the less radical end of what could be done, the idea of a European redemption fund is exactly what is needed.  Under this funds would be used to guarantee debt over a certain level.  It would limit exposures, reduce debt costs and provide a stable foundation for reaching a sustainable long-term debt position.  It is also originally a German idea and is compatible with Germany&rsquo;s basic law.</P>
        <P>The &euro;180 billion stimulus talked about last week, and to which the Taoiseach alluded in his speech, is nothing of the sort.  The proposal is &euro;60 billion in project bonds issued by the EIB with some form of common guarantee.  The rest is due to come from co-financing and private-sector leveraging.  This is no stimulus and it is no help.  The countries most in need do not have the co-financing and cannot add further to their general government debt levels.  As proposed, the countries likely to benefit are those that least need help.  We need more than generalised conclusions or recommendations from the Council, we need specific insistence that there can be applications to countries like Ireland.  I ask the Taoiseach not to return to this House next week once again making inflated claims about decisive steps to fund growth and jobs.  The project bonds are a minor distraction from the real business of restoring confidence and transferring funding to regions in need.</P>
        <P>The meeting on Friday is likely to see agreement on some form of greater banking union.  If this is limited to a handful of large cross-border banks, it will be irrelevant.  A single monetary policy needs a single core banking regulator.  There can be no opt-out for powerful regional banks.</P>
        <P>In regard to the proposed financial transactions tax, no one has produced even the most basic analysis of how this could operate on a selective European basis without costing tens of thousands of jobs and huge investment.  It is a good idea to constrain the speculators but this will only be done if all significant financial markets sign up.  The current proposal would deal a dramatic blow to financial services in participating countries and we should have nothing to do with it.</P>
        <P>There has been a lot of briefing about making a decisive move towards real fiscal and political unions.  From the available information no such unions are being proposed.  The models being promoted in the media simply involve a further heightening of budgetary controls on eurozone members.  Genuine fiscal and political unions involve a significant and flexible transfer of resources between members.  The redistribution of surpluses between states is the core of the fiscal and political union of states in the United States of America.  The way in which this matter is being discussed goes to the heart of whether leaders are serious about tackling the crisis.  Germany and others have to be called-out on the way they refuse to acknowledge that a large part of the surpluses they are jealously protecting were generated because of the flaws in the euro which have engulfed others in deficits.  Without a transfer union there can be no fiscal union and it is time to stop pretending otherwise.</P>
        <P>The timid approach of our Government and many others must stop.  The Taoiseach needs to end his policy of sitting quietly on the sidelines refusing to speak directly when urgent needs are being ignored.  Wringing his hands about Germany is no substitution to setting out a policy and lobbying for it.  Unless he actually tries to work with others to persuade leaders to take a different approach, he can achieve nothing.  The Taoiseach should stop talking about technical papers and set out what we think we need on promissory notes to return to the market next year.  He should stop mumbling about vague ideas and set out clearly what reforms he thinks are the minimum required to save the euro and end the crisis.  He should stop putting media spin ahead of the harder and more important work of pushing Ireland&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>Many respected commentators fear that it is already too late for Europe.  We need our leaders to understand the gravity of the situation.  The cost of their failures last year is already high and there was some acknowledgement of that in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opening remarks.</P>

        <P>This week the Taoiseach has yet another EU crisis summit.  Yesterday Spain formally requested European aid of up to &euro;100 billion for its banks, making it the fourth state to require an EU bailout, within hours of that Cyprus became the fifth state seeking a bailout for its financial sector and today Italy is paying more at a bond market.  This summit, which was billed as a growth and jobs summit, will inevitably be dominated by the rising borrowing costs of Spain and Italy and the weaknesses of the European banks.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach needs to set out what he will be advocating at this summit.  Will he be bringing forward a stimulus plan?  We have not heard that.  Does he have concrete proposals about how the EU Structural Funds should work, we have not heard of those, or about how funds from the European Investment Fund could be used in conjunction with the National Pensions Reserve Fund to stimulate growth in Ireland, about which we have not heard any word?  Has the Taoiseach spoken to other EU leaders about this plan?  We have not heard of either the plan or of the Taoiseach lobbying in support of it.  Has he sought allies for his proposals?  We have not heard his proposals or who he may have contacted in support of them.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach told us on 6 June after the informal summit that the board of the European Investment Bank had been asked to report to the June meeting on the capacity of future lending for qualified structural projects.  Has the Taoiseach had sight of this report?  I do not have the same script writer as Deputy Martin but the script before me states: &ldquo;You cannot continue to sit on the sidelines and hope, as you did on the issue of the jobs and growth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
        <P>Well done lads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;that other leaders will come up with proposals that will benefit the citizens of this State&rdquo;.  What the Taoiseach said is in the programme for Government.  The Government needs to deliver the commitments made in the programme for Government and during the recent referendum campaign.  The Taoiseach promised to remove the burden of the banking debt from taxpayers but this has not happened.  He promised jobs, investment and stability and I regret very much that this has not happened.  It is my certain view and also the view of many citizens that Europe&rsquo;s leaders are failing.  Last July, they and the Taoiseach agreed to a restructuring of Greek debt but almost one year later and the situation is as bad as ever.  Last autumn, the European Central Bank provided large-scale liquidity to banks to try to ease the situation in Spain and Italy but this has not worked either.  Last December, the eurozone agreed the fiscal treaty and more money to end the crisis.  I note what Deputy Martin said during that campaign and juxtapose it with what he has said today.  The Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; most of Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; persuaded citizens to vote for the treaty in May and this has not worked either.</P>
        <P>I refer to the situation in Spain where &euro;100 billion was allocated to help clean up that country&rsquo;s banking crisis but Spain&rsquo;s bond costs have risen even further.  I have not had much time to study the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement but he states he looks forward to the report from Herman van Rompuy.  However, this report is expected to demand even greater fiscal union within which the EU could intervene directly in the budgets of member states.  More fiscal authority will be given away by the Government and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, despite all the protestations by Deputy Martin today.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s conversion to Sinn F&eacute;in policy because Sinn F&eacute;in policy has been consistently to argue for the ESM to fund banks directly.  However, he needs to go beyond Government rhetoric on this important issue and he needs to advocate actively for this policy.  Similarly, on the issue of growth and jobs, the Taoiseach needs to bring forward proposals for job creation and retention.  He engages in revisionism in his statement today when he suggests the Government has long argued for such proposals.  On the contrary, the record shows that he never mentioned jobs even once before the French presidential election.  It is all a mess and the Taoiseach and his partners in Europe need to stop digging the hole deeper.  Unless there is a radical change in the current policy the instability will continue and may result in the collapse of the euro.  The Irish Government needs to work with other EU states to find a real solution to the eurozone crisis.</P>
        <P>From the very start of this crisis, Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated a restructuring of private bank debt and a separation of bank debt and sovereign debt.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued consistently that the function of the ECB needs to be re-examined and it needs to fulfil the role of a lender of last resort.  The current policy of austerity and bank bailouts has caused only greater instability in the eurozone.  The one-size-fits-all monetary policy was part of the problem and it cannot work.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is firmly of the view that what is required is a different approach based on investment and economic growth.  A total of 24 million citizens are unemployed across the EU and in this State, 440,000 are on the live register.  We see once again the scourge of emigration.  The Taoiseach represents a rural constituency.  I am currently doing a tour of rural Ireland and the situation is heart-breaking.  The effects of emigration are more invisible in the cities but in some rural parishes, as many as 18 young men and as many young women are gone.  Senior teams are unable to play games because they do not have sufficient numbers for a senior panel.  The visit of President Michael D. Higgins to London last week illustrated how many of our young people are now ensconced there.  We need our young people back and we will only get them back with investment in jobs.  There is a fixation with austerity.  Fine Gael is a conservative, right-wing party which has austerity at its core but for the Labour Party to embrace this policy goes beyond any sense of itself or its history or possibilities.</P>
        <P>The crisis is a crisis of under-investment.  The banking crisis led to a withdrawal of private sector investment from the domestic economy on an unprecedented scale.  The result is the loss of jobs for many and of spending power for all.  In the absence of private sector investment the State needs to fill the investment vacuum.  This can be achieved by combining the resources of member states, for instance, combining the &euro;5 billion in the discretionary portfolio of the National Pension Reserve Fund with an enlarged investment fund in the European Investment Bank.</P>
        <P>This summit needs to give the people of Europe some hope that leaders have learned from the mistakes already made.  The crisis has been made much worse by the policy of the European Central Bank, supported by the German Government and the previous French Government, of bailing out banks irrespective of the cost.</P>
        <P>Austerity is part of the problem and a continuation of this bad policy will have devastating social and economic consequences.  This can be seen in the numbers of patients on trolleys in our hospitals and the long waiting lists for treatment.  I have given examples from Louth and I am sure the situation is similar right across the State.  I note that some members of the Government are committed to cutting social welfare rates or to an increase in income taxes.  The Taoiseach needs to stand up for Irish Interests at this summit and we need to stop the slide towards the collapse of the euro.  This should not be another crisis summit which ends up with a commitment to hold yet another crisis summit.  There must be a clear plan for renewal and growth and for jobs and investment.  The European banking system must be cleansed of its toxic debts.  There is an urgent need to reduce the debt levels across the eurozone through debt restructuring.  The Taoiseach repeated this fallacy this morning that we will not be defaulters.  The huge burden on citizens of the banking debt must be reduced.  The crisis will not be brought to an end by greater fiscal integration, by giving away more fiscal power; it will not be brought to an end by austerity and by bank bailouts.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in recommends a strategy of investment, debt write-downs and market return.  This is the type of plan which EU leaders need to agree this week.  The Taoiseach must advocate this plan if he has not done so.  He has not told the House of any plan.  It appears he is going to the summit not as a player but as a spectator and I am disappointed in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
        <P>It is not even a month since the people went to the polls on the issue of the austerity treaty.  We are the lucky ones because most of the 495 million EU citizens did not get a chance to have their say at the polls.  The Irish people said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with a very heavy heart.  Many did so because they believed they had no choice.  They believed they would otherwise fall off the funding cliff.  A week or two following that referendum result, there has been a complete disregard of the Irish people.  The Government then claims it is likely to push for a further federalisation of Irish political and fiscal powers.  Individual citizens who had done their best to come to a difficult decision are now told that this is not enough because the plan is to force further political development in the State.  The Government is not standing up for the people of Ireland.  The difficulties being experienced by us are being disregarded.  My colleague, Deputy Adams, has described some of the cuts implemented in his locality.  In County Meath, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan will soon lose overnight accident and emergency services.  The Government&rsquo;s cutbacks and austerity are creating deep difficulty within Irish society in terms of the basic services people require.  In addition, as has been mentioned, 76,000 people were forced to emigrate last year due to the Government&rsquo;s decisions.  The GAA generation is being deleted from our midst because of austerity policies.</P>
        <P>Consider the damage caused in this State by monetary union.  The property bubble could not be ameliorated because we did not have interest rate powers to try to pour water on that fire.  There is also the damage from &euro;64 billion being sunk into the banks by this and the previous Governments.  That is a direct result of the monetary union in which the State finds itself.  The Government&rsquo;s solution to all this is further monetary and fiscal integration.  This Government, in tandem with Angela Merkel, is pursuing a policy that is creating instability.  The policy of this Government and the German Government will either bring about the end of the euro or, the only other option, federalisation of the eurozone.  Again, it will be an either-or choice for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>European Council President van Rompuy and European Commission President Barroso pulled no punches in the pre-Council meeting report, entitled &ldquo;Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union&rdquo;.  The language is unambiguous and federalist.  They are preparing the road for yet another power grab.  We voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and by doing so we have, unfortunately, emboldened the federalists within Fine Gael, the Labour Party and in the EU to grab more power from the Irish people and hand it to the centre.  Every time power is grabbed from the Irish people and given to the centre the priority of the Irish economy is no longer accepted.  Indeed, we have come down to third, fourth and fifth in the list with regard to policy decisions that happen in Europe, instead of the Council summit considering appropriate ways to deal with investment.  Members will recall that the debate before the fiscal treaty referendum was about investment for jobs and how jobs and growth are the only ways to get us out of our problems.  Now, however, Fine Gael and Labour Party Ministers increasingly tell us that it is not investment that will solve the current problems, but the further hand-over of Irish sovereignty and political power.</P>
        <P>The Government has a major opportunity at the forthcoming meeting to take the problem by the scruff of the neck for the first time.  It can talk to other marginalised states around Europe, build a consensus or a coalition of nation states in Europe and use that coalition to create a bulwark against the federalists who are increasingly trying to take power from Irish citizens.  It can also use that consensus and coalition to seek investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank to get people back to work rather than sending them on the route to emigration.</P>

        <P>The meeting of European Union leaders on Thursday and Friday will be the 20th meeting since the eurozone crises started in earnest in Greece in early 2010.  Since then, the political and economic ruling classes within the European Union have floundered in the face of a catastrophic crisis of their system.  The abject failure of the political leadership in the European Union to find a solution arises, of course, from the failure of Europe&rsquo;s major capitalists to overcome the contradiction within their economic system.  It is a system through which a tiny corporate elite, including the speculators in the financial markets, rules.</P>
        <P>The abject failure of European political and economic leaders is most horrifically expressed in the fact that 17 million people are currently unemployed in the eurozone and an horrific 27 million people are unemployed in the European Union.  The youth in Europe are the foremost casualties of mass unemployment, with an unprecedented level of over 50% in Spain alone.  The President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, is to present a report to the EU summit this week, including what he says is a vision that can best contribute to growth, jobs and stability.  Unfortunately, it is a mammoth contradiction to speak of growth, jobs and stability on the one hand and, on the other, to continue to implement a savage regime of austerity, which is designed to salvage the capitalist economic and financial system, particularly the financial markets, from the crisis on the backs of the ordinary working class people of Europe.</P>
        <P>How disastrous austerity is for the working class, the poor, the youth and the pensioners of Europe is seen most graphically in Greece where, most tragically, society is being destroyed.  To satisfy the bondholders, people in Greece are being driven into penury.  Children are hungry in the classrooms while workers, both manual and professional, queue for soup kitchens.  Tragically, the suicide rate has shot to the highest in Europe as people see no way out.  Greece is being pauperised and turned into a country with what used to be described as Third World conditions.  This is happening in the European Union, whose leadership used to lecture us and boast about what a model of solidarity the European Union was.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach talks about getting investment flowing in the real economy.  In reality, he is looking to corporate Europe for investment.  He referred to an increase of &euro;10 billion to the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s capital, which will leverage a further &euro;60 billion.  He then mentioned a figure, and we do not know where it comes from, of &euro;180 billion in investment, which is relying on the corporate private sector.  The Taoiseach has not been reading the financial press.  If he had been, he would have seen striking articles in the <i>Financial Times</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on the fact that the proportionate rate of investment to gross domestic product in Europe is at a 60 year low.  Within the eurozone &euro;2 trillion lies uninvested by major corporations.  They are uninvested profits because the corporations are not confident that they can make further profit if they invest.  That is &euro;2 trillion that could and should be invested in massive job creating enterprises, major and necessary infrastructure and services that would take millions of workers from the unemployment wasteland and put them into productive employment, remaking and regenerating our society.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s approach to corporate profits?  It says that corporations have a sacred right to make whatever profits they wish and to do anything they wish.  It will not even consider further taxation.  The Irish Government, pathetically, will not even support a tiny tax on speculation in the financial markets, the financial transaction tax.  We should have an emergency tax, of at least 50%, on the &euro;2 trillion of uninvested profits lying in corporate cash hoards throughout the eurozone.  It should go into investment in job creation, rebuilding society and creating hope for young people and people who are under so much pressure at present.  What Herman van Rompuy&rsquo;s document promises, in fact, is even more draconian regimes than covered by the austerity treaty we debated over the last few months.  It is clear that the central agenda is to give the markets what they want once again; what is being acceded to is their agenda.  It is more austerity to bleed more from the ordinary people of Europe to satisfy the greed of the bondholders and the speculators.  Unfortunately, the Irish Government falls on its face in front of this agenda and the financial markets.  Ongoing austerity to bleed the resources of society to feed the bondholders and the speculators is what Mr. Von Rumpuy is proposing rather than any fundamental break or plans of growth and investment.</P>
        <P>On 19 May <i>The Independent</i> newspaper in Britain carried a banner headline on its front page &mdash; &ldquo;Capitalism at a Crossroads&rdquo; &mdash; referring to a global crisis of this system.  It is critical and clear that an alternative to this disastrously failed system is desperately needed.  We need socialist policies, socialist planning and a socialist alternative to replace the chaos of the financial market system, with policies that put human beings at the centre of society before private profit.  The working class people in France, Greece and many other countries have shown by their actions, movements and votes in recent months that they want an alternative, and their power must be used to mobilise to change society rather than relying on yet another meeting of floundering EU leaders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</NameTxt>
        <P>As the T&aacute;naiste is very well aware, over the next three days this country will pay &euro;1.1 billion to bondholders in the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  As he is no doubt aware also, those bonds were originally issued by those institutions in 2007, therefore, the people who bought those bonds in 2007 knew that they were taking a risk.  If they did their due diligence they will have seen that those institutions were heavily exposed to a property bubble.  The IMF warned at the time of an abrupt unwinding of the housing boom.</P>
        <P>If the people who purchased this &euro;1.1 billion from Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide did their homework they will have known that they were buying inherently risky financial products and that they were getting higher profits on them than had they bought bonds from the Irish sovereign, the American sovereign or the German sovereign because there is an implicit risk.  Since then, a group of those original bondholders will have sold them on and they will have been bought at massive discounts by speculators.  For the next few days, therefore, the Irish people will pay hundreds of millions of euro in profits to speculators and professional investors who know that sometimes the value of their investments go down as well as up.  I imagine most people in the Government, and perhaps all Government Deputies, would agree that it is grotesque for us, the Irish people, to be paying &euro;1.1 billion to people to whom we owe no money while at the same time cutting services to disabled children throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that the Government would prefer not to be paying this money, certainly if we are to believe some of the pre-election statements on the issue by the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and many others.  However, what the payment this week says to me, and this is one of the last outstanding payments on Anglo Irish Bank, is that the strategy this Government has pursued has failed.  The strategy the previous Government pursued also failed.  It has bankrupt the country and left us in a very precarious position.</P>
        <P>In terms of that strategy, what I have heard, as a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is a Government state repeatedly that the debt is sustainable and that we can and will pay our way.  I constantly hear a quasi-moral statement that we will pay our debts, that we always pay our debts and that Ireland is a country that pays its way in the world, ignoring the fact that we are paying other people&rsquo;s debts at the same time.  I see a Government which has repeatedly acceded to demands from foreign powers that we pay all of these bondholders and whose strategy appears to be based around waiting and seeing what other countries, seeing if we can get a bit of it as well and hoping that moves us into a more sustainable economic position.</P>
        <P>On our strategy, the Nobel laureate Professor Stiglitz recently stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Iceland did the right thing by making sure its payment systems continued to function while creditors, not the taxpayers, shouldered the losses of the bank.  Ireland&rsquo;s done all the wrong things, on the other hand.  That&rsquo;s probably the worst model.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Why are we getting the worst model?  Why are we doing everything wrong?  Why are we getting the worst deal?  Why did we not get a write-down similar to that given to the Greeks?  Why are we not being looked at in favourable terms as is the case with the Spanish?  Why is it that we in Ireland seem to get the worst deal from everybody?</P>
        <P>I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that there are two serious reasons for that.  The first is that we are not acting like we cannot pay these debts, and the second is that we are not saying we cannot pay these debts.  In terms of how we are acting, on the floor of the House this morning increments were brought up with the Taoiseach and I understood him to say that the Government would honour the Croke Park agreement.  That means that this year the Government will pay &euro;180 million in non-performance related automatic pay rises.  A total of 47 of the people getting those automatic pay rises are at assistant secretary level and earning &euro;127,000.</P>
        <P>The other way we are acting is that we are not saying that we cannot pay.  Again, on the floor of the House this morning the Taoiseach stated that a default would be a disaster and a catastrophe.  He went on to state, &ldquo;This country has always paid its way&rdquo;.  Of course we are not getting any write-down and are being forced to pay the bondholders.  How can we credibly say to the European Central Bank and the European powers that we do not have the &euro;1.1 billion when they can say that we have given our own employees &euro;1 billion worth of pay rises in the past four years?  They will say that we can afford it.  We are acting and speaking in a way that we are able to afford this debt and that we have some moral obligation to pay this debt.</P>
        <P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider changing the strategy in two ways.  First, we have got to behave like a country that cannot afford to pay these bondholders.  We must start acting like a country that will not be able to service a debt that is about to be 120% of our GDP.  It will not happen.</P>
        <P>Second, I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to recognise that others in our position achieve write-downs.  Iceland achieved an &euro;85 billion write-down in its banking debt and as we know, its economy is picking up nicely and it has half our unemployment rate.  We know that Germany got write-downs in 1932, 1939 and 1948.  The list goes on.</P>
        <P>There is a paper by well known economists Rynhart and Rogoff on the history of default in which they conclude that default is the rule rather than the exception, and that is default on sovereign debt.  We are not even talking about that.  We are talking about default on private debt or non-payment of private debt.</P>
        <P>There is some good news to help our strategy.  The IMF put it on record recently that the ECB has incorrectly forced this country, under very serious threat, to pay off these bondholders and that it should not have done it.  There is a growing acceptance here, in Europe and across the world that the State should not have to bear the burden of the banking sector, particularly when it does to a state what it is doing to us.</P>
        <P>I suggest that now is the time to change tack.  A concerted diplomatic offensive in Europe and with our allies in the United States and in other parts of the world would help, and it must include a change in the conversation whereby we would say that we cannot pay this debt, we never owed it, and we do not pay other people&rsquo;s debts.  We should remind those on the other side of the table who are telling us we have to pay all this banking debt of all of the debt write-downs they have had in the past 50 or 60 years before we get up on our high horses and start moralising.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider those suggestions and start changing the conversation to get this debt under control.</P>

        <P>I welcome the contributions made by Deputies to this debate.  It is very important that the Oireachtas is fully involved in our European business, particularly when such important issues are involved and these debates are a significant part of that work.  We are truly at a critical juncture for the future of the European Union project, and the future of the eurozone in particular.  I believe this House has an important contribution to make to that work.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will travel to Brussels this week with the Taoiseach to participate in pre-European Council political consultations and will work with the Taoiseach to prepare the Government&rsquo;s position for the Council.  As the Taoiseach outlined earlier, it will be a key meeting for a number of reasons.  First, this week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council will agree a new compact for growth and jobs.  This is a sea change.  For the first time, the growth agenda will take centre stage and be endorsed with the highest level of political commitment.  This is a welcome development which this Government has been advocating for some time.  While it is clear that we will not have stability until governments bring their budgets under control, it is equally clear that there will be no recovery within Europe without growth.  We need a clear and concrete strategy to achieve it, and this compact is a major step in the right direction.  Coupled with the van Rompuy report, it will map out a way forward.  This is the time for action.  We need to see our way out of the crisis and to take the necessary steps to get there.</P>
        <P>The new compact will bring together a series of actions to be taken at the level of member states, but critically it will also set out the contribution that European policies can make to growth and employment across the Union.  These will include efforts to get investment flowing to where it is needed most, through the European Investment Bank, project bonds and the re-programming of structural funds.  In doing this, it is essential that we do not allow bureaucratic hurdles to get in the way of getting important investment flowing to the regions which have been hardest hit by the current crisis and where it can have the most positive impact.  The Government will be making the case for a pragmatic flexibility.  That affects Ireland&rsquo;s future interests and we will be clear in our views on this in Brussels this week.  The new compact also addresses the very considerable growth potential which remains within the Single Market.  There remains considerable scope to achieve more.  Once again, we see Ireland as a beneficiary of that potential.  To this end, we look forward to the presentation by the Commission of a further set of growth-enhancing measures during the autumn.</P>
        <P>We must prioritise a properly-functioning digital Single Market, which facilitates cross-border on-line trade.  Trade also offers a real engine for growth.  We look forward to the early formalisation of free trade agreements with both Singapore and Canada.  Progress in trade negotiations with the US, and with India and Japan, will be important in giving the global economy a shot in the arm, and will boost the export of European and Irish goods that serve markets around the world.</P>
        <P>As well as adopting the new compact, this week&rsquo;s European Council will also consider President van Rompuy&rsquo;s report on how to strengthen economic and monetary union.  In his report, the President has identified the essential elements on which we need to work to ensure a strong, stable and durable economic union, namely, greater integration on banking, on budgetary frameworks and on economic policy.  This is a perspective the Government has called for and it is welcome to see it now formally on the table.  However, although all of these proposals will build momentum in the right direction, it remains my firm and clear view that until we break the pernicious link between bank and sovereign debt, we will not restore confidence.  This needs to be done in the short term because for as long as it remains, it will be difficult to restore confidence in the markets.</P>
        <P>The van Rompuy report sets out an agenda for strengthening economic union in the medium to long term in a way that is fundamentally in the interests of all Europeans, including the people of Ireland.  It does not, of course, pretend to address the immediate crisis.  That will also have to be addressed in a clear and decisive way at this week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council.  President&rsquo;s van Rompuy&rsquo;s report covers the elements on which we are going to have to find a way forward if we are to deliver long term stability. which is, after all, what it is about.  It is not about integration for integration&rsquo;s sake, but reinforcing economic union to ensure a stable and secure future.  We need to see the right balance between sharing of mutual risk and furthering of integration.  Put simply, solidarity must accompany integration in a balanced manner.  Our challenge is in the immediate here and now.  We need political will to show concrete steps in the short term.  A theme running through all elements of President van Rompuy&rsquo;s report is the need to ensure full democratic legitimacy and accountability throughout the process ahead.  This is absolutely vital and we have long advocated it.  We in Ireland know better than most the critical importance of bringing people with us.  Their support cannot be taken for granted.  President van Rompuy clearly envisages a role for national parliaments, including this House, in what lies ahead and this is both necessary and welcome.</P>
        <P>This meeting of the European Council has a very full agenda.  In addition to the compact and President van Rompuy&rsquo;s report, it will address for the first time at Heads of State and Government level the next multiannual financial framework.  It will also address a range of other issues including: the Justice and Home Affairs area;the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro; nuclear stress tests; and foreign policy issues, most notably the evolving situation in Syria.  The House can be assured that the Government will work to advance and defend Irish interests throughout the process.</P>

        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the topic of the ongoing crisis in Syria, which seems to be escalating out of control as each day passes.  I wish to state my total support for Ireland&rsquo;s commitment and support for the cause of international peace.  Our Defence Forces have played a key role down the years in many areas throughout the world and I hope they continue to do so.</P>
        <P>My main reason for tabling this issue today is to establish the position of six members of the Irish Defence Forces who are part of the United Nations supervision mission in Syria.  That mission was to supervise a ceasefire as part of a six-point plan devised by Kofi Annan.  The ceasefire has not happened and over a week ago the United Nations announced it was pulling back from its monitoring operations.  However, the mission remains in Syria.  There is great concern among the family members of the Defence Force members in Syria.  They are concerned about their security and safety, particularly as the mission is unarmed and is to remain in the country.  According to news and other reports, UN vehicles have been shot at and hit on numerous occasions.  They suffered both direct and indirect attack before they halted their monitoring patrols.  Explosions have also occurred close to the UN patrols.</P>
        <P>I understand the members of the Irish Defence Forces are in communication with their families, as are the Defence Forces here.  Is there a plan in place to deal with the situation if communication with Syria or with the area in which the mission is breaks down?  Is there a plan for an emergency evacuation in the event of the situation escalating further?   I understand the monitoring mission has been stepped down but that it will remain in Syria until 21 July.  What are the plans after the mission is complete post 21 July?  I understand that initially the aim was for the mission to continue for a longer period, perhaps for years, but this appears to be under question now.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for taking the issue and I call on him to answer the queries raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the current appalling situation in Syria and I thank Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony for raising the issue.  All right-thinking people are offended by the continuing violence and blatant repression of human rights which are estimated to have claimed more than 10,000 lives in the past 15 months.</P>
        <P>The situation in Syria was extensively discussed at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, which I attended.  The Council adopted strong conclusions condemning the brutal violence and the recent massacres at Houla and Al-Qubair and urging the Syrian regime to cease killing its own civilians.  The Council was united in the view that President Assad and his regime have no place in the future of Syria.  The Council also discussed and strongly condemned last Friday&rsquo;s shooting down of a Turkish jet fighter by the Syrian forces.  This incident illustrates well the serious regional ramifications of the Syrian crisis and how easily the conflict could spill over into neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon.  I emphasised this point in my intervention as there is now widespread concern to ensure that the current rather fragile stability in Lebanon is not endangered by events in Syria.</P>
        <P>In face of the repeated gross violation of human rights carried out almost on a daily basis, all Syrians are legitimately entitled to expect that those guilty of such atrocities must be held to account.  These issues are being discussed at the current session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, at which Ireland and its EU partners are active and which is likely to adopt a strongly worded resolution on the human rights situation in Syria in the coming days.  We have also made clear that we will support any referral of Syria to the International Criminal Court by the UN Security Council.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony referred in particular to the situation of the six brave members of the Defence Forces who are participating in the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, UNSMIS.  At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday I highlighted the critical situation of the UNSMIS.  The operating difficulties faced by the mission were such that the force commander, General Robert Mood, had to suspend monitoring activities on 16 June.  This came about in the face of escalating violence, a rise in completely unacceptable attacks on UNSMIS patrols and the constant obstruction of its activities.  I understand, however, that as of yesterday UNSMIS has been able to resume conducting patrols and that the conduct of such patrols is being reviewed on a daily basis.  I welcome this development.  I expect the Syrian authorities to ensure from now on the full safety and freedom of movement of UNSMIS observers.  In early July, the UN Secretary General will submit proposals to the UN Security Council and troop contributors on the future of the mission after its current mandate expires on 20 July.  I earnestly hope that it will be possible for the mission to continue in some form beyond next month.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant problems it is encountering, the Annan plan is thus far the only platform available to end the violence and to initiate a long-awaited political transition in Syria.  We remain fully committed to this plan and to Kofi Annan&rsquo;s efforts to bring about a more concerted international response to the crisis.  Closer engagement with Russia remains crucial in this regard.  In the meantime, pressure must be increased on the Syrian regime to abide by its international obligations.  The EU has already imposed extensive sanctions against Syria and further measures were adopted yesterday.  At this stage, however, UN sanctions would be most effective, in particular, a comprehensive arms embargo to prevent arms getting through to both sides.  I urge early action by the UN Security Council in this regard.  The prospects for further increasing the pressure on the Syrian regime as well as encouraging greater unity and co-operation among the Syrian Opposition will also be considered at the next meeting of the Friends of Syria Group in Paris on 6 July, which I will attend.</P>
        <P>The priority must be to end the violence and initiate some form of political process leading to transition in Syria.  For the moment, we must continue to lend full support to the special envoy, Kofi Annan, the UN and the Arab League in their efforts to bring this about.  Ending the conflict, not escalating it, remains the goal to which the international community must direct all its efforts.</P>

        <P>The Government continues to attach the highest priority to the safety and security of the members of the Defences Forces participating in the mission and that of all those participating in the mission.  Close contact is being maintained between my Department, the Department of Defence and the UN, through our mission in New York.</P>
        <P>General Mood fully briefed troop contributor countries and the UN Security Council during his recent visit to New York.  We have received assurances from the United Nations that ensuring the safety of personnel and the safe conduct of patrols will continue to have the highest priority as UNSMIS resumes monitoring.  I hope UNSMIS can continue in some form after its current mandate expires because its presence is of great importance and reassurance to the Syrian people.  I take on board Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s comments on the concerns of family members of those serving on this difficult mission and I would be happy to brief him or to have my Department brief him on the steps being taken with regard to ensuring the safety of the personnel involved.</P>
        <P>The events in Syria represent one of the greatest challenges to international peace and stability.  There is daily escalation of violence and casualties, which are horrendous.  Since the conflict erupted Ireland and our EU partners have been at the forefront of international efforts to steer the Syrian authorities away from violence and repression and to persuade all parties to engage in a peaceful process of transition.  The conflict in Syria is bloody and horrific and I assure the House that we are determined to contribute to its resolution.  We have contributed personnel to UNSMIS which is working in difficult circumstances.  We are giving the highest priority to the safety and security of the members of the Defence Forces involved in the mission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of compensation for women excluded from the redress scheme of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  All Members, including the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, have acknowledged the appalling wrongs done to the women who suffered altogether unnecessary hysterectomies at the hands of Michael Neary.  The redress scheme of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was rolled out in 2007.  It covered most of the victims but, unfortunately, it left 35 women in the cold.  These women did not fit into the bureaucratic grid designed for the scheme.  The intransigence of former Minister, Mary Harney, meant that calls for the inclusion of these women were met with cold indifference for years, which compounded the injustice they had already suffered.  I understand that 29 of these women were excluded on the grounds of age.  Women under 40 who had unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies were barred from even applying to the scheme.  In one exceptionally harsh case a woman was excluded because the procedure was delayed by one week and, as a result, took place just three days after her 40th birthday.</P>
        <P>The voices of these women went unheard for four years until this Government committed to finding a mechanism to compensate those who were excluded from the redress scheme on age grounds alone.  Other women have been excluded for reasons other than age, including some who lost children and others who suffered unnecessary gynaecological hysterectomies.  These cases have already been raised by the Patient Focus organisation.  Last February I was heartened by the Minister for Health when he stated to the House that he was aware of these cases and had given an undertaking to Patient Focus that he would review them.  He went on to indicate that the review was already under way.  However, I am concerned that five months later there is still no sign of a mechanism to acknowledge the grievous wrongs done to these women, who have already been waiting five years.  What was done to these women was shameful.  We must not add insult to injury by forcing them to wait any longer for the justice they deserve.</P>

        <P>I thank Deputy Nash for raising this issue.  I recognise that he feels strongly about it and has raised it in the House on a number of occasions previously.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government commits to finding a mechanism to compensate those women who were excluded on age grounds alone from the Lourdes hospital redress scheme.  I am conscious of the distress that has been caused to a number of women and recognise the difficulty the issue has caused to those affected by it.  The Government is committed to dealing with the matter sensitively so that, if at all possible, closure can be brought to those affected.</P>
        <P>The Lourdes hospital redress scheme was established following the findings and recommendations contained in the report of the Lourdes hospital inquiry into peripartum hysterectomy, which was published in 2006.  The inquiry was conducted by Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark.  The inquiry did not extend to a wider examination of Dr. Neary&rsquo;s general practice or the clinical practice of his colleagues.  However, during the inquiry Ms Justice Harding Clark became aware of certain patients who underwent bilateral oophorectomy procedures, or the removal of their ovaries, which were not clinically necessary.  These women lost their ability to reproduce and suffered immediate surgical menopause.</P>
        <P>The scheme of redress approved by the Government was a non-statutory, <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme.  Awards were determined in 2007 and 2008 by an independent redress board chaired by Ms Justice Harding Clark.  The objective of the scheme was to provide compensation to the patients of Dr. Michael Neary who received unnecessary obstetric hysterectomies, that is, hysterectomies carried out in association with pregnancy, and women under 40 years of age who received unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies.  The Department of Health has been engaged in a review aimed at finding a mechanism to compensate those who were excluded from the original redress scheme on age grounds alone.  This review involves taking legal and other advice, including from the Office of the Attorney General, on this sensitive issue.  I understand that departmental officials have engaged with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I am also aware of the recent media reports in respect of High Court litigation where sums have been awarded to plaintiffs against the Medical Missionaries of Mary for incidents that occurred prior to the State taking over the hospital.  In this context, I understand that litigation is currently before the courts in respect of two plaintiffs who were patients of Dr. Neary.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is committed to finding a mechanism as soon as possible and that he intends bringing proposals to Government for its consideration at the earliest opportunity.  I am aware of the sensitivities associated with this issue and understand the importance of finding a solution that will bring closure for all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and welcome the commitment in the programme for Government regarding the women who were outside the original scheme.  The removal of ovaries and the crude withdrawal of the ability to reproduce is difficult for any woman to accept but it is particularly difficult in cases where such procedures are not clinically necessary.  These are challenging circumstances for the women involved, many of whom reside in my constituency.  In light of the impact this process has had on the women and their families, I ask the Minister of State to bring a sense of urgency to the matter.  I recognise that she understands the sensitivities involved but I do not want the Attorney General to review the issues arising in perpetuity or the views expressed by the Minister and departmental officials to disappear into a black hole in her office.  That has happened too often.  These women need closure and justice must be done for them and their families.</P>

        <P>I assure Deputy Nash that I am conscious of the sensitivities involved and the serious distress that has been caused to these women.  There is no question of the issue disappearing.  Departmental officials are currently holding discussions with the Attorney General and I reiterate the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is aware of the difficulties that face homeless people.  I wish to discuss the particular difficulties experienced by homeless people in accessing dental services.  There are no reliable national data on the number of individuals who are homeless in this country.  I have seen estimates of up to 5,000 people and concerns have also been expressed about the increase in the number of young people who are homeless.</P>
        <P>I ask that funding be ring-fenced for dental services for the homeless in Galway and Galway city in particular.  Galway Simon Community and HSE west are co-operating closely to help the homeless despite the moratorium on recruitment.  Progress has also been made on funding for chiropody services for homeless people and a multi-disciplinary team has been put in place with a psychiatric nurse, a substance misuse counsellor and a designated community nurse.  I pay tribute to the nurse, Ms Joan Gavin, and her team for the work they are doing.  However, the homeless face major barriers to accessing dental services.  They are a high risk group for oral and dental disease and dental services should form an integral part of the primary care services for these vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>When I speak about homelessness I do not refer solely to those who are sleeping rough.  Those who live in hostels, sleep on the sofas of their friends&rsquo; houses or remain in hospital because they lack a home in which to recuperate are also affected by these issues.  They receive limited entitlements because they are treated under the group medical card scheme but they also require dental services.  Many also suffer from depression and other problems.  My main request is that the Minister of State considers funding and considers ring-fencing funding for dental services for the homeless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising the issue, which he has been concerned about for some time.  I am pleased to address dental services for homeless people in Galway.  The dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, provides access to dental treatment for adult medical card holders.  The service is provided by dentists contracted by the HSE.  The DTSS budget for 2012 is &euro;63 million.  A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment are available to all eligible patients.  Patients with special needs, those who have greater clinical needs and high-risk patients, including people who are homeless, receive priority for treatment.  High-risk patients are those for whom untreated dental disease or the treatment of dental disease poses significant health problems.</P>
        <P>The National Oral Health Office of the HSE issued standard operating procedures to dental contractors in November 2011 to support equitable and priority funding and provide clearer guidance to dentists on the application of DTSS prior approval requests.  The procedures confirm that high risk patients are to be prioritised for approval.  They receive all DTSS services that were available prior to April 2010, when services were reduced because of budgetary constraints.  This includes an examination, all fillings as required and approval for complex care including root canal treatment, gum treatment and dentures.  Homeless people, because of their lifestyles, tend to have a range of attendant needs including education, training, employment and housing, as well as a range of medical issues including addiction, mental health and general health issues.  Addressing this range of requirements requires interaction between the HSE, Departments and statutory and non-statutory agencies.  The needs of homeless people are complex and the response must be multi-faceted and complex.</P>
        <P>The HSE has established a number of ways to bring health services to homeless people through, for example, the establishment of outreach multi-disciplinary teams that provide sessions in a range of homeless hostels and day services.  The HSE gives priority to processing of medical card applications for homeless people in order to assist them in accessing available services.  Of course, access to services can be arranged locally where necessary, pending a medical card being issued.  Key workers for the homeless in Galway routinely link with dental services and the use of mainstream services is directed and encouraged.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently funding a diploma in special care for six dentists as part of an upskilling programme.  Part of their training and remit includes the provision of services for homeless people and other vulnerable groups.  The expertise of the graduates will be used to advise and support decision making on dental services for homeless people.  I am pleased that, once qualified later this year, one of the graduates will be assigned to the HSE west area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and I am pleased to note that the diploma is being funded by the HSE as part of an upskilling programme.  One of the six dentists will be assigned to the HSE west area.  Apart from the representations made by me, the Minister of State also received representations from the Galway Simon Community, which does great work, and the multidisciplinary team under Ms Joan Gavin, which lobbied strongly for funding.  I hope that what the Minister of State says will be put in place.  Many people feel that, even with various limited services available and the fillings and extractions allowed under the medical card, we do not meet the needs of a vulnerable group of people.  Perhaps matters will improve and I give due credit to the Minister of State for the funding of chiropody and other services.  Providing services for homeless people is complex.  Depression and the insecurity of people living in hostels, friends&rsquo; houses or in hospital and worrying about where they will go when they are discharged must also be dealt with.  I hope the extra funding for the diploma will help.  Everything should be done to meet the needs of a vulnerable group of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputy Kitt in this regard.  I assure him that I will give this issue further attention in the coming months.  It is a welcome development that additional dentists will be trained specifically to cater for vulnerable groups, including homeless people.  The additional person in the HSE west will be a positive development.  I hope I can come back to the Deputy later in the year with specific details on what is proposed.  People who are homeless in the Galway area, who have medical cards, are entitled to the enhanced services currently available.  I appreciate the difficulty in accessing such groups or encouraging them to avail of the services but I encourage them to take up the services available to them.</P>

      <sTitle>Criminal Assets Bureau</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topical issue.  I have raised this matter before, as the Minister is aware.  The week before last, at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, we examined a European model for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Irish system and model is held up by member states across Europe as the ideal and there are attempts to duplicate CAB across Europe, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I said it was time to examine the procedures for CAB, which are defined in legislation.  It is time for a conversation on how to use the funds gathered by CAB.  Under section 21 of the Act, a report must be laid before the House.  The report breaks down the money confiscated under three headings &mdash; the proceeds of crime, money liable to be paid to the Revenue Commissioners and money liable to be paid to the Department of Social Protection.  I asked whether we could ring-fence money coming from CAB to put into communities ravaged by drug abuse.  The idea has merit and is one we should explore at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</P>
        <P>When I raised this point in the past, the Minister has told me that ring-fencing money runs contrary to the Estimates procedure.  The second reason is the amounts confiscated vary each year, which will not allow for proper funding streams for community projects that need to be planned three or four years in advance.  However, there are a number of one-off capital projects and promotional projects that local drugs task forces and community groups could use year after year.</P>
        <P>There is merit in ring-fencing the portion of money under the proceeds of crime heading.  Between 2006 and 2010, that sum amounts to &euro;14 million, whereas the money to be repaid to the Revenue Commissioners amounts to &euro;44 million and money to be repaid to the Department of Social Protection amounts to &euro;1 million.  The sum of &euro;14 million out of that pot is a significant amount of money to put into communities dealing with drug abuse at the coalface.  It only requires an amendment to the legislation to enable it to happen.  I ask the Minister to consider the idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I am aware that the Deputy has raised this matter on several occasions and is keen to have a full debate on the question of diverting moneys collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau into community programmes.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the current position in this regard.  The bureau has served the State well in tackling serious and organised crime, including drug trafficking in this jurisdiction.  Its work is an important part of the overall response to serious crime.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and his force, together with the Revenue&rsquo;s Customs and Excise service, on the extraordinarily significant seizures of drugs in Dublin and Kildare today.  This event demonstrates the determination and resourcefulness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise service in tackling the activities of the major players in the illicit drugs trade.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005, all moneys collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are returned to the Exchequer.  In 2010, the total sum forwarded to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Exchequer through the actions of the CAB was approximately &euro;7 million, of which &euro;3.1 million related to actions taken on foot of proceeds of crime legislation, some &euro;4 million related to actions under revenue legislation and &euro;180,000 was raised through social welfare actions.  These funds are returned to the Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.  Suggestions have been made from time to time that moneys collected through the actions of the bureau should be used to fund community programmes.  I appreciate that such proposals are made out of concern for the well-being of those communities most exposed to the adverse affects of crime in our communities and which bear the burden of living with its consequences.  I also appreciate the significance of such a gesture as potentially a visible and tangible expression of the right of our communities to have returned to them advantages that were taken away by criminals within those communities.  It is a suggestion that has been discussed from time to time and on which my Department has previously consulted with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>While it has always been accepted that there may be a symbolic value in the suggestion, it has also been acknowledged that the ring fencing of such moneys gives rise to a number of practical difficulties.  We are all aware of the requirement that public moneys be spent only as Voted or approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann unless otherwise provided by statute.  A policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose, such as the funding of community programmes, runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.  While there is a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, generally speaking, impose constraints on the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.  It can also be argued that a significant proportion of the moneys secured by the bureau, as evidenced by the statistics I gave for 2010, are already owed to the Exchequer, being related to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.</P>
        <P>In regard to the suggestion that particular projects be funded from proceeds of crime activities, given the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the bureau in any given year and taking into account the delays that may arise through possible legal challenges to court disposal orders, the provision of ongoing funds to community projects would be problematic.  The uncertainty surrounding the level of revenue available on a yearly basis would not facilitate the proper planning of such programmes by organisations involved in the delivery of community development services.  It is also the case that additional costs would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert funds to local programmes.  There would certainly be an additional administrative burden in the management of any such programme, whether through the engagement of service providers to administer an application process or otherwise.  These additional administrative costs would arise without any additional revenues being generated.</P>
        <P>The reality, given the present economic climate, is that the Exchequer could not sustain a loss of revenue without making compensatory adjustments.  If the CAB money were to be diverted to community programmes, there would inevitably be implications for any other moneys those programmes received from the Exchequer.  Alternatively, other public expenditure programmes would have to sustain the loss.  While there are superficial attractions in the type of proposal the Deputy is putting forward, I ask him to reflect that, given the difficulties facing the Exchequer, his proposal would not have the positive effects he wishes to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he acknowledged, I have been seeking a more wide-ranging debate on this matter for some time.  I accept his point completely in regard to moneys owing to Revenue or to the Department of Social Protection.  As I said, the figures from 2006 to 2010 show some &euro;44 million going back to Revenue and approximately &euro;1 million to the Department.  I am not suggesting for one moment that these two pots of money should be ring-fenced for community funding purposes.  I acknowledge that these are moneys that should have been gone to the State in any case.  I have no issue with that.  I am asking the Minister to review the other transferred money, namely, the &euro;14 million from the proceeds of crime.  He observed that such a scheme would be difficult to administer.  Why could it not be done by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs or even the Health Service Executive, to give just two examples?</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s argument that such a scheme would have only superficial benefits.  We are talking about communities under enormous pressure because of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Most if not all community groups have been subjected to cuts in funding in recent years and are expecting more of the same in the future.  I am arguing that there is an opportunity to ring-fence this particular allocation for the benefit of communities.  I do not accept that this would run contrary to normal Estimates procedures.  We only have to look to the introduction of the household charge to see how money can be ring-fenced if the political will exists to do so.  What I have proposed could be introduced by way of a simple amendment to legislation.  I understand the Minister is considering the introduction of legislation to provide enhanced powers to the CAB.  That undertaking provides an opportunity at least to explore some of the proposals I have put forward.  It would be a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s sincerity in raising this issue and admit that his proposal does have certain attractions.  However, I am obliged to be conscious not only of what is in the current legislation but whether, on a policy basis, the introduction of such a scheme would be a good idea.  The work done by CAB is paid for out of public funds, as is the work done by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring to justice those engaged in serious criminal activities.  In circumstances in which the financial position of the State is substantially constrained on a general policy basis, I cannot support an amendment to legislation the effect of which would be to ring-fence any portion of the moneys obtained by the CAB in the manner the Deputy is suggesting.  It is not how we should proceed at this time because it is not defendable in the context of the fiscal difficulties confronting the country.  It is important to bear in mind that some of the moneys  retrieved by CAB go into the general pool of funding, out of which pool the Department of Justice and Equality receives the allocation it requires to fund a range of programmes designed to support and assist the communities to which the Deputy referred.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to present this important legislation to the House, the primary purpose of which is to close an existing loophole in the law.  Under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, it is an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence.  However, that provision of the 1998 Act specifically excludes sexual offences.  I am therefore bringing forward this Bill in order to ensure there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of all serious offences, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda of same.</P>
        <P>Members of this House will be well aware of the content of published reports such as the Ryan report, the Murphy report and, more recently, the Cloyne report.  These reports provide a litany of quite shocking revelations concerning the sexual abuse of children and failure to respond to that abuse.  More recently, further revelations concerning Fr. Brendan Smyth have emerged.  It is clear from these revelations and the various reports published that, if those who had knowledge in the past of sexual offences committed against children had informed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many children who subsequently became the victims of abuse may have been protected from clerical sexual predators.  I believe there is, therefore, a compelling argument for closing the current loophole in the law.</P>
        <P>As Members of this House will also be aware, the full scale of abuse of children which has taken place in the past is still not fully known and new information is continuing to emerge.  The problem is also not confined to offences against children.  There have also been a number of equally serious cases of vulnerable adults in institutional care being subject to serious sexual and physical abuse.  In drafting the Bill, however, I must also be mindful of the fact that the balance of evidence suggests that the majority of abuse of children or vulnerable adults takes place in the person&rsquo;s own home.  It is, therefore, important to reaffirm that we are not just concerned with issues of sexual abuse by persons in authority, be they in the Catholic Church or in any other religious group, or institutional settings.  I must emphasise that this Bill applies to all persons, all organisations and all sectors of society.  It is important that we produce legislation that affords protection from abuse to children or vulnerable persons, in any scenario or in any location.  That is essentially what this Bill is about.</P>
        <P>Members of this House have already been very supportive of the Bill when contributing to the consideration of the draft scheme of the Bill at hearings by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Bill before us today has been drafted to include provisions to take account of the issues raised by the joint committee in its deliberations.  Under the provisions of this Bill, it will be an offence to fail to disclose to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without reasonable excuse, information concerning certain serious criminal offences where such offences are committed against a child or a vulnerable adult.  These &ldquo;serious offences&rdquo; are listed in the Schedules to the Bill.  These offences all carry a penalty of imprisonment of five years or more.  They include most sexual offences and offences such as assault causing harm, causing serious harm, cruelty to a child, abduction of a child, manslaughter and murder.  The Bill also establishes some limited defences for persons charged under it, such as a parent, guardian or medical professional who is acting in the interests of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person.</P>
        <P>I would like to outline for the House the key provisions contained in the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard interpretation section which defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 creates the offence of withholding information on serious offences against children.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to a number of key provisions in this section.  First, it is only an offence to withhold information where the person knows or believes that an offence has been committed, and the person has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the offender.  This means that a person is not under any obligation to inform the Garda regarding any kind of vague rumours, innuendo or suspicions.  He or she only commits an offence if he or she has substantive information regarding an offence and fails, without reasonable excuse, to disclose that information to the Garda.  This reflects similar offences contained in other Acts, such as the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  I also want to highlight the fact that section 2(2) provides that the Bill will only apply to information that a person receives, or becomes aware of, after the Bill becomes law.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with the Attorney General, it was decided that it would not be feasible to make it an offence to withhold information where that information had been received before the Bill was enacted.  There are potential legal concerns in regard to applying the provisions of the Bill to confidential information received prior to this law coming into force.  There are also practical issues.  I am mindful of the fact that most abuse happens within families, and in many cases the facts of the abuse would be known by siblings or other family members who were not themselves the perpetrators.  Making the law retrospective and applicable to information received by a family member, or to a person who provided support to a victim many years ago, would in many instances be unjust.  It would potentially criminalise individuals who had in good faith decided that it was not appropriate to report an offence to the Garda at the time they became aware of it, but who would not be able to show that their decision meets the revised standard now required in this Bill.  The new law will, therefore, apply to non-disclosure of information received after the Bill is passed, although it may relate to something that happened before enactment.  This ensures that in regard to future actions, behaviours and responsibilities there is certainty and clarity in the law.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Bill also provides that the victim cannot themselves be guilty of any offence if he or she chooses not to disclose the offence against him or her.  This exclusion was welcomed during the consideration of the Bill by the Oireachtas joint committee.   Subsection (3) of this section confirms that the victim of any offence covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information where he or she does not report the offence to the Garda.  Subsection (4) provides that the Bill is without prejudice to any right or privilege that is recognised in law.  In that regard, this provision is simply to allow the courts to use their normal discretion in considering issues of privilege.  There has been a lot of media comment suggesting that this Bill has an effect on the &ldquo;seal of confession&rdquo; or sacerdotal privilege, although there has been less agreement within that commentary as to what the exact impact or effect will be.  One report suggested that the entire clergy of the Catholic Church are exempt from the requirements of the Bill.  Another stated that the clergy is bound by the Bill, and that I am persecuting the church.  Let me repeat my earlier comment: this Bill applies to all persons, to all organisations and to all sectors of society.  No one is exempt from prosecution.  A person charged may claim any defence that he or she so wishes but it will be a matter for a court to determine, in the circumstances of a particular case, the extent to which that defence does or does not exist.</P>
        <P>It must also be borne in mind that existing provisions in the criminal law for the protection of children continue to apply.  Current provisions in the criminal law have frequently been ignored in media reports on this Bill.  These include section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which makes it an offence for a person with authority or control over a child or abuser to intentionally or recklessly endanger a child by causing or permitting a child to be placed or left in a situation which creates a substantial risk to the child of being a victim of serious harm or sexual abuse.  It is also an offence to fail to take reasonable steps to protect a child from such risk while knowing that a child is in such a situation.</P>
        <P>On the subject of privilege, I point out that the issue of confession does not arise in regard to the many cases of criminal offences identified in the Ryan, Murphy or Cloyne reports.  These reports all relate to complaints of abuse made to the church authorities by the victims or by family members or by members of the public.  Nor, as far we know, is it an issue with regard to the reprehensible activities of the late Fr. Brendan Smyth and many of the other priests who have during the past two decades been convicted and sentenced in this State for child abuse.  The provisions of this Bill will ensure that in the future those who have knowledge of similar crimes against children or vulnerable persons and who fail to disclose that information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be prosecuted and convicted for that failure.</P>
        <P>Section 3 creates the offence of withholding information on certain offences against vulnerable adults.  It has the same structure and provisions as apply in section 2 in regard to withholding information concerning offences against children.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for a range of defences for persons who are acting in the interests of the health and welfare of the victim.  It is important to note that nothing in the Bill will impede any victim, or any other person, at any time from going to the Garda to report an offence.  The defences in the Bill solely relate to circumstances where the victim chooses not to do this, or does not have the capacity to do this.  As I have already mentioned, subsection (3) of sections 2 and 3 provides that the victim of any offence covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information where they do not report the offence to the Garda.  It follows from this provision that a person who does not report an offence, at the request of the victim, also has a legitimate defence.  This is set out in section 4(1).</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, reference was also made to the difficulty which arises where the victim does not have the capacity either to report the offence or to make a decision as to whether they want another person to report it on their behalf.  Many victims of abuse do not have the capacity to report offences against them either owing to their age or some other vulnerability.  Such victims should be able to rely on another person to act on their behalf.  The Bill provides that where the victim does not have the capacity to form a view as to whether the commission of the offence should be disclosed to the Garda, and the offender is not a family member, then the parent or guardian can make known, on behalf of the victim, that the victim does not want the offence to be so reported.  An important safeguard in this circumstance is that the parent or guardian concerned must have reasonable grounds for acting on behalf of the child or vulnerable adult and must show that in doing so, they are acting in the best interests of the child or vulnerable adult.</P>
        <P>They must also show that they had regard to the wishes of the child.</P>
        <P>Members will also note that there is a presumption in section 4(2) of the Bill that a child under 14 years of age does not have the capacity to decide whether to report an offence and might wonder why this age has been chosen.  It is important to state that a child of any age can, if he or she wishes, choose to report an offence.  Nothing in the Bill prevents this.  The reference to the age of 14 in the Bill is to allow the parent or guardian to act on behalf of the child, where the child is below that age limit.  The age of under 14 has been chosen because a child of 14 years or over is, under the provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 considered legally competent to give evidence on oath or affirmation.  Having considered the options, the Government agreed that under 14 years is the most appropriate age.  The law would be inconsistent if it allowed a person of 14 years or over to give evidence under oath but did not recognise him as her as having the capacity to determine whether information in relation to an offence against him or her should be disclosed.</P>
        <P>The Bill must give separate consideration as to what provisions are appropriate if the victim does not have the capacity to report the offence and the offender is a family member.  In these circumstances, it is considered that it is not appropriate for the parent or guardian to act on behalf of the child because of the potential conflict of loyalties within the family.  The Bill, therefore, provides in section 4(8) that in these circumstances a designated professional, who is providing services to the child or vulnerable person in respect of the harm or injury caused by the offence, may make it known that in his or her view the information relating to that offence should not be disclosed, provided that he or she can show that he or she is acting for the purpose of protecting the health and welfare of the child.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that designated professionals are doctors, nurses, psychologists and social workers.  In making these provisions, I am trying to ensure that the Bill will not discourage a victim from seeking appropriate treatment at a time when required and when he or she is too traumatised by what has happened to go through the additional trauma of making a report to the Garda&iacute;.  In cases where the victim is very severely traumatised, a medical professional, who is treating him or her, should be able to decide that it is not in the interests of the victim&rsquo;s health and welfare to report the offence at that time.  It is important to note that the medical professional will under the Children First Guidelines which are to be placed on a statutory footing by the Children First Bill, still be under an obligation to notify the HSE of any abuse of a child.  The draft scheme of the Children First Bill has been published by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and is currently under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  This separate obligation to notify the HSE, contained in the Children First Bill, is important to ensure that even where an offence is not reported to the Garda&iacute; under this Bill, the victim is given the appropriate supports, treatment, monitoring and protection.  I anticipate that the number of cases where it is appropriate for a medical professional to decide on behalf of the victim that a report should not be made to the Garda&iacute; will be limited in number.  In cases where the victim is very severely affected by the offence, this provision will be vital in order to provide the most appropriate protection for the health and well-being of the victim.</P>
        <P>This Bill also provides in subsections (12) and (13) for persons providing counselling services to have similar defences to those available to a medical professional who is treating the victims.  Under the Bill, these are referred to as &ldquo;prescribed persons&rdquo; who are employed or otherwise engaged by &ldquo;prescribed organisations&rdquo;.  A number of organisations, which provide counselling and support services to victims of sexual abuse, made the point in submissions to the Oireachtas committee that they often have to work with victims over an extended period of time before the victim can reach a decision on whether to report an offence to the Garda&iacute;.  I am anxious to ensure that victims are not discouraged from accessing supports which they need because of concerns that the seeking of such supports will immediately require a reporting of the crime to the Garda&iacute; for the purposes of a criminal investigation or subsequent prosecution.  As with all of the defences in the Bill, the priority is the protection of the health and welfare of the victim.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6 set out the manner in which an organisation may seek to be prescribed for the purpose of the Bill.  It will also be the responsibility of such organisations to apply for persons within that organisation to be prescribed for the purpose of defence under section 4.  Applications under sections 5 and 6 must be accompanied by information concerning the type of services provided, the training, expertise and qualifications of the persons concerned, the procedures for ensuring compliance with this Act and the arrangements for assessing the quality of services.</P>
        <P>Section 7 sets out the penalties for persons guilty of an offence under this Bill.  It provides for penalties, which vary from a class A fine and up to 12 months in prison to a sentence of up to ten years in prison, depending on the seriousness of the offence against a child or vulnerable adult, regarding which information has been withheld.  The ten year penalty would apply in the most serious cases, such as the withholding of information concerning the murder of a child.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for the amendment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 in order to ensure that there is no overlap or duplication between the provisions of that Act and this Bill.  Section 9 was introduced by way of amendment in the Seanad and corrects a minor oversight in the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012.  Sections 10, 11 and 12 are standard provisions concerning the making of orders, expenses and commencement.</P>
        <P>Schedule 1of the Bill sets out in detail the offences against children which must be reported to the Garda&iacute;.Schedule 2sets out in detail the offences against vulnerable persons which must also be reported to the Garda&iacute;.  The offences are being listed individually in order to provide complete clarity as regards to the type of offences that constitute &ldquo;serious offences&rdquo; which must be reported under the law.  Members of the House will be aware that this Bill is one element of a suite of legislation, namely, the Children First Bill and National Vetting Bureau Bill, to protect children and vulnerable persons, to which the Government is committed.  In particular, this Bill has been drafted to complement the operation of the Children First Bill.</P>
        <P>It might be helpful to the House if I elaborate further on how the Bill is to harmonise with the proposed Children First Bill, the scheme of which is currently under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The Government is bringing these two separate and distinct measures in recognition of the very separate and distinct roles of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE with regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for the investigation of criminal offences.  The HSE is responsible for providing the necessary supports and monitoring for children at risk.  This Bill focuses on the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and requires those with information relating to a serious criminal offence to provide the Garda&iacute; with that information so that they can investigate the alleged crime.  The Children First Bill will address the role of the HSE.  It requires that relevant persons in a position to assess children at risk of abuse must provide the HSE with the information necessary to monitor and provide supports to a child who may have been abused.  Any criminal investigation will be conducted in a parallel investigation by the Garda.</P>
        <P>The obligation under this Bill to disclose information is in addition to and, not in substitution for, any other reporting requirements.  This recognises that the requirement to report information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the HSE are separate and distinct measures, which are necessary to protect children and vulnerable persons.  I am pleased to inform the House that I will shortly publish the Bill to place the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable adults on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>I thank Members of this House who have already provided support for this Bill in their contributions to the hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the draft heads of the Bill.  I thank them also for their suggestions during those hearings on how the Bill as published could be improved.  I am sure the debate on the Bill in this House will be informed and constructive.  I look forward to that debate.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks on the Bill.  I also thank him for allowing for a discussion at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the Heads of the Bill, which was an informative process attended by various interested groups.  I believe this part of the debate will be far more informed as a result of that process.  I acknowledge the changes made by the Minister to the heads of the Bill based on that discussion and take this opportunity to compliment the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, Deputy David Stanton and committee secretariat, who facilitated the attendance of the various groups at those  hearings.  This process has been repeated on a number of occasions in relation to other pieces of legislation.  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s role in ensuring that happened.</P>
        <P>It is almost a year since the Cloyne report was published.  Also, the report by Mr. Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons was recently published.  I welcome that we are now putting in place robust legislation to ensure that the type of incidents reported in those reports will not happen again and that there can be no defence of ignorance in the future.  On that basis, Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes any legislation that genuinely strengthens child protection in Ireland.  The Minister has been at pains to emphasise the legal side of this, which was the theme of much discussion at the hearings on the Bill.  Many of the support groups were concerned that people who engaged with them would feel they had to make a legal claim.  The Minister has made appropriate allocation for this situation.  We would hate to think people would deny themselves the supports available for fear of having to go through the criminal law process.  I welcome the fact the Minister improved the heads of the Bill to do this.</P>
        <P>The big challenge with regard to the legislation is probably not with the Minister&rsquo;s Department but with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in ensuring the resources the legislation will require are in place.  She made comments over the weekend on her intention to pursue the Shannon and Gibbons report and I believe all of us will support her on this.  On the passage of this legislation and the Children First legislation a very comprehensive information campaign will be necessary with regard to people&rsquo;s rights and responsibilities.  This Bill and the Children First legislation mark a new era in the maintenance of information and the treatment of child protection complaints in this country.  I know the Minister will agree, given his strong track record in this area, that we cannot have somebody claiming ignorance of the new legislation or regime in a weakened defence.</P>
        <P>With such an information campaign it is probably inevitable to expect we will share the experiences of many other jurisdictions with regard to a surge in cases being reported.  In the course of his summing up I ask the Minister to clarify what is meant by the reference in the Bill to knowledge previously available but not provided.  Will this prevent the situation which happened in other jurisdictions whereby there was a huge increase in the number of complaints, some of which were vexatious?  The difficulty with such an increase is that unless we ramp up the system some of the more serious complaints will get lost.  When mandatory reporting was introduced in New South Wales it resulted in a 600% increase.  Such an increase would be unbearable unless the appropriate resources are put in place.</P>
        <P>The number of available social workers was increased on the basis of the Ryan report.  However this pool was reduced through retirements last February and we need to ensure their replacements are found as quickly as possible.  This is one of the difficulties and challenges facing the Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is not the role of the Minister to put in place the budget for this but will he give us a guarantee or assurance that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are aware of the potential consequences of this Bill in terms of their resources and that we will not have a situation whereby cases may get lost or delayed in the avalanche and victims may not get the justice they should expect to receive under the legislation?  With regard to the expectations that are being created, many people did not have access to this type of legislation.  Some people did not have the opportunity to access the legislation on the various redress schemes and we owe it to those who will now have such an opportunity that if they make a proper complaint it will not be lost in the avalanche of complaints that will arise out of this.</P>
        <P>The national review panel stated its workload was virtually impossible to carry out because of the number and breadth of inquiries.  Since March 2010, 35 children or young adults in HSE care or known to child protection services have died.  This is in addition to those on which the report was issued last week.  The national review panel highlighted several deficiencies in our current child protection system, several breaches of the Children First guidelines, inadequate supervision of HSE practices and an absence of a standardised method of assessing the needs of children and young people who came to the attention of social services.  I know the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is seeking to address all of this with the new children&rsquo;s agency.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether the implementation of this legislation will be housed in the Department of Justice and Law Reform or the new children&rsquo;s agency?  Which Department will be responsible for monitoring the legislation?  Will it be the Department of Justice and Law Reform or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?</P>
        <P>It would be appropriate a year after the implementation of the legislation to have a report to the committee to examine whether a surge of complaints has been created, how such surges are managed, and whether the required resources for the implementation of the legislation are in place.  This would be of assistance to everybody.</P>
        <P>Mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse was never policy in any part of the UK and the Munro review there did not recommend it.  However, given our history in this very small jurisdiction we must go down this road.  We must give confidence that protection is available and that people&rsquo;s stories will be heard properly.  We cannot avoid this.  The safeguards to be put in place through this legislation will eventually weed out vexatious claims and gossip, as the Minister mentioned, and they are the last thing we need.</P>
        <P>The biggest challenge we face is to ensure the resources are in place.  We need to ensure when the new agency is being established that nothing gets lost in the transfer of responsibilities from the HSE to the new agency, as otherwise the legislation will be considerably weakened.  There must be joint planning between the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs in the coming weeks and months on the establishment of the new agency and ensuring the legislation is co-ordinated between the two Departments and the Department of Health and, most importantly, that a service delivery plan is co-ordinated with an appropriate budget in place and that we do not have the situation, as often arises, that one Department blames another if something does not happen.  We can avoid this if the three Ministers, or people in their offices, take a share of the implementation and we have a joint implementation body, so that nobody can blame a crack in the system for the lack of implementing the legislation.</P>
        <P>Those who are survivors of abuse may have mixed feelings about today.  The Oireachtas is sending out a message that we are drawing a line under what happened previously and that there will be no hiding place for those who have information and will not share it.  One will no longer be able to legally justify &mdash; and in my opinion one could never have justified it morally &mdash; hiding information on the abuse of a child regardless of the role one has.  We will now have the power of the law behind this.  It is being done in a way to dissuade gossip, messers and people with alternative agendas other than the interests of a child and it is to be welcomed.  The committee debate on the heads of the Bill was constructive and I hope this constructive debate continues on Second Stage.  We are due to take Committee Stage next week so it will not be a challenge for us to implement this and have it signed into law prior to the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had an opportunity to discuss the heads of the Bill.  This has been done on a number of occasions and in this case we are seeing the benefits of it in how the Bill has been presented and the changes made since the heads of the Bill were first published.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary touched on many of the issues on which I was going to speak so I will not go into detail on them.  There is an obvious need to ensure the related Bills coming before the House, including this Bill, the Children First Bill, the national vetting bureau Bill and the mental capacity Bill, compliment each other. The Ombudsman for Children has already indicated we need to be very aware that various pieces of legislation are being brought forward.  Some people would have liked to have seen this Bill and the Children First Bill streamlined.  I agree with the analysis the Minister outlined in his closing remarks.  I think having two separate Bills was the prudent way to go about it.  We can see the benefits of that in the Bill that has been published.  Obviously, we will have much more discussion on Committee Stage next week.  The Sinn F&eacute;in office is drafting a number of minor amendments to try to improve and strengthen this legislation.  We hope the Minister will be able to take them on board.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary made an important point about resources.  He said that when this Bill is finally enacted, there will have to be a public information and awareness campaign focusing on what is contained in this Bill and on the responsibilities of individuals and organisations.  We cannot allow anyone to use ignorance as an excuse for their failure to report a suspected case of child abuse.  It is important for a broad public information campaign to be financed.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary mentioned some statistics which reveal that the number of cases being reported in other jurisdictions increased when legislation of this nature was introduced.  We have to be aware that additional resources are required in such circumstances.  In the brief period since I was elected to this House, I have seen how this problem has arisen with regard to legislation that was enacted before I became a Deputy.  Problems arise when legislation is enacted but the necessary resources and finances are not provided to ensure the legislation does what it is supposed to do.  In this case, it is important for us quickly to identify and put in place the resources that will be necessary.  We cannot use our economic circumstances in any way to lessen the provision of the resources that will be needed to deal with the increase in the number of reported cases.  When the Fines Act 2010 was introduced, we failed to provide the resources required to implement it.  As a result, well-intentioned legislation that was passed by this House became redundant.  We cannot allow that to happen in this instance.</P>
        <P>I agree that the operation of the legislation before the House should be reviewed after 12 months.  I suggest that a report should be submitted to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or the Joint Committee on Health and Children to enable us to ascertain whether the resources which will be necessary to deal with the likely increase in the number of reported cases are being put place.  In such circumstances, we will be able to identify any gaps that exist.  We will also be able to specify where additional resources are needed and ensure they are provided.  I concur with what has been said about the need for clear lines of communication.  When this Bill has been enacted, we will have to make it clear who will monitor this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister touched on the contents of section 2(4), which deals with the issue of privilege.  I welcome his comment that this legislation will apply to every individual and every organisation, regardless of who or what they are.  I echo those comments because no individual should have any opportunity, following the enactment of this legislation, to be under the illusion that he or she does not have a legal responsibility, in addition to his or her moral and legal responsibility, to act.  If such a person fails to act, he or she will be guilty of a criminal offence.  I welcome that because it is important.</P>
        <P>Some groups that addressed the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality expressed concern about how the practical aspects of the legislation will work out.  There was a fear that if the legislation was too robust, it might deter victims from coming forward.  Some victims might not be ready to report cases of abuse.  That has been addressed to some extent.  We will have to examine it much more closely on Committee Stage next week.  The Minister mentioned that this matter is dealt with in section 4(8) of the Bill.  That will alleviate some of the concerns that exist.  We will discuss it in much more detail on Committee Stage.  We must ensure that victims who need support services are not apprehensive about coming forward because of a fear that they might be held liable under this legislation if they do not report cases.  Equally, such people might be afraid that those to whom they wish to speak might be obliged to report what they say.  The Minister touched on such issues.  We will consider them further.</P>
        <P>I look forward to next week&rsquo;s Committee Stage debate.  My party will facilitate the quickest possible passage of this legislation through the House.  However, we have to be careful not to rush it.  We need to get it right.  I expect to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage next week.  I hope they can be discussed in detail and thrashed out.  When Committee Stage has been completed, I hope the Bill can be passed before the summer recess.  We cannot afford to delay it.  The quicker we can put in place the collective legislation in this regard &mdash; this Bill, the Children First Bill, the vetting Bill and the legal capacity Bill, all of which will complement each other &mdash; the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I am delighted to speak on the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.  I welcome some of the comments that have been made by the Minister.  The report that was published last week, like the other reports of recent years, reminds us that we cannot leave any stone unturned as we try to ensure there is no ambiguity about the fact that those who might wish to evade prosecution, having failed to pass on certain information, cannot be allowed to find a hiding place in this country.  Regardless of how slight one might think that information is, one must understand that one has a clear responsibility to pass it on.  If one does not do so, one will be open to being questioned, charged, arraigned and brought to court &mdash; if not necessarily found guilty &mdash; and it will be up to the court to determine whether one had the right or privilege to withhold the information in question.  If charges of any kind are brought, one cannot be under any illusions about what one failed to do.</P>
        <P>Many reports have been produced over the past decade or more.  As public representatives, we often hear harrowing tales when we meet victims, families and support groups.  Some people are not members of support groups and are not looking for any financial compensation.  I was interested &mdash; perhaps that is the wrong word &mdash; to meet a non-aligned group of people from several denominations last week.  They made it clear to me that this is not confined to the Catholic Church.  Many people, including me, were or are of the opinion that it is confined to the Catholic Church.  I was told by the group that made the submission in question that this is far from the truth.  We know now that it crosses all divides, religious or otherwise.  There is evidence of that throughout the world.  That does not lessen or make easier the horrific acts perpetrated against juveniles and against the human being.  No effort should be spared to deal with such cases.  In that context, I commend the Government for bringing forward this legislation.</P>

        <P LI="4"><Miles com="mdash66" />the proposed merger of the National Library and the National Museum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputy Robert Troy.</P>
        <P>This motion is important because it recognises the positive contribution a thriving arts and cultural sector makes to society as a whole.  It is important to state for the record that the previous Government indicated its intention to produce a Bill on amalgamation.  However, it consulted the directors of the National Archives and the National Library and the chairman of the Irish Manuscripts Commission and asked for their observations.  It is important to put on the record that the general scheme of the Bill was not approved when Fianna F&aacute;il left office and no changes were agreed by Government.  That said, I acknowledge that much of the momentum for this emanated from the bord snip nua report.  In my view, the policy as articulated was wrong and I set that on the record of the House.</P>
        <P>We have consulted widely with the arts sector and have observed and reflected on the public debate that has arisen recently.  Following that process, our Front Bench introduces this motion in a genuine way that is designed to try to change tack and course before it is too late.  This motion reflects our belief that it would be irresponsible not to publish a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed changes before proceeding.  Having listened to and researched the views of stakeholders and experts in the field, we believe the independence and autonomy of this sector is crucial and must be maintained.</P>
        <P>The outstanding and valuable role that arts and culture play in our national life and the sector&rsquo;s potential to develop further is threatened by what I believe to be a short-sighted approach by the Government.  This Government has failed miserably to appreciate or harness adequately the potential of the arts and creative industries as a powerful tool towards economic renewal.  Furthermore, by its shoddy treatment of and broken promises to this sector, this Government has not grasped that the arts are part of our national identity and go to the core of our Irishness.  This sector deserves our respect and encouragement and does not deserve to be short-changed or kept in the dark.</P>
        <P>The Government should think very carefully about moving in an arbitrary and cynical manner in terms of merging long-standing and valuable cultural institutions as part of a quick fix or counter-productive strategy to make savings.  We on this side of the House will oppose that.  The motion gives the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, the opportunity to state unequivocally he will not support any plans to merge cultural institutions as this would undermine their independence and damage our cultural heritage.  I urge the Minister to do so even if that means finding the political courage to say &ldquo;hands off&rdquo;, because independence in this sector is crucial.</P>
        <P>I have met representatives from the sector.  They realise reform is necessary.  They will co-operate with reform, but the red line is independence.  Ireland&rsquo;s arts and culture are not an optional extra or an expendable luxury but are intrinsic to our make-up as a nation.  Our cultural heritage and artistic talent are recognised and appreciated all over the world.  This gives Ireland a unique and valuable brand that provides us with a real competitive advantage in a globalised world.  In the middle of a world recession, we should be leveraging this great national resource, not pulling the rug from under it.</P>
        <P>On this side of the House we will listen very closely to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, as will countless arts and culture organisations.  No rationale or detailed explanation has been offered as to what benefit merging these cultural institutions will bring.  Even more perturbing is the Government&rsquo;s failure to engage in any meaningful discussion with the cultural sector about its agenda.  Proposals that threaten the very edifice of our national cultural architecture cannot credibly be imposed by Government without taking on board the views of stakeholders.  The Minister needs to listen and engage.  He must also reflect on the long-term damage that will be done by removing the autonomy of boards which have a sole mandate to protect cultural institutions, discarding years of built-up expertise and putting the governance of cultural institutions at the behest of a Department which has numerous other priorities.</P>
        <P>This action will certainly make it easier to impose a severe cutbacks regime on our cultural institutions.  It will facilitate those who cannot see beyond &ldquo;fumbl[ing] in a greasy till/And add[ing] the halfpence to the pence&rdquo;.  The reality, however, is that this approach can only cost the State revenue rather than generating it in the way our arts and cultural sector has been doing all along.</P>
        <P>We all recognise the need for efficiencies in a time of economic recession.  The cultural institutions are willing to play their part and have expressed a willingness to collaborate and work together where cost savings can be shared.  The last thing we need, however, is shotgun amalgamations which are not grounded in detailed consideration and strategic planning or even respectful consultation.  I look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to square the public service reform plan published on 17 November 2011 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and take in conjunction the Government&rsquo;s statement on State agency rationalisation and the pre-election promises of Fine Gael.  The campaign run by Fine Gael in 2011 was the most dishonest election campaign the country has ever seen.  We know now about the broken promises on Roscommon hospital, the &ldquo;not another red cent&rdquo; for the banks, the pledges given to students, the breast care centre in Sligo and the unit for the elderly in Lifford.  It is a list that continues to grow.  Another stand-out deception to add to this shameful catalogue is Fine Gael&rsquo;s pre-election promise that cultural discussion will be driven up the agenda of Government and that the arm&rsquo;s length principle will be respected.  In his remarks, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, might have the good grace to admit the cynicism and shallowness of those pledges.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s pledge that cultural discussion will be driven up the agenda of Government has been replaced by the sad reality of obfuscation and a deficit of dialogue.  It is worth pointing out to the Minister the recent remarks by Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee to the Seanad, and the director of the Abbey Theatre, our national theatre.  Speaking in the Upper House on 24 May, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a crisis in the way culture and our living heritage is administered by the Government.  This is not about money but about the lack of vision and public consultation in the way our national cultural institutions are being treated in a profoundly secretive and cavalier way.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I also look forward to hearing the views of the Labour Party Members of this House.  Senator Bacik has strongly defended the arm&rsquo;s length principle, stating on 7 June:</P>
        <P LI="1">I think it is important that the Boards and Directors of all the national cultural institutions, such as the National Museum and the National Library, should remain at arms&rsquo; length from Government, in keeping with the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, introduced by former Arts Minister, Michael D. Higgins.  In this way we will ensure the maintenance of their reputation, both national and international.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is good to see the Labour Party Senators showing some independence of thinking in recent times.  On this motion, however, nobody should be surprised to see Labour Party Deputies follow more slavishly the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s instructions to prop up Fine Gael, irrespective of which party principles are abandoned.  That has been an all too regular pattern in this D&aacute;il.  This motion is a test of the political courage of the Labour Party Deputies.  Will they support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s defence of the arm&rsquo;s length principle, something that has been agreed by all for many years and by successive generations in the House?</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s, in particular Fine Gael&rsquo;s, lack of empathy with or understanding of our arts and culture are in contrast to the policy of our party.  Our policy is that Ireland&rsquo;s unique culture has long played a key role in defining us as a people and promoting a positive view of Irishness around the world.  We do not need and will not support forced marriages of convenience for our cultural institutions.  A new generation of Irish people are making their mark among the most renowned and respected artists in the world and we believe they deserve to be encouraged and supported.  From our writers and musicians to our architects and animators, Irish people continue to punch far above their weight on the international stage.  This reflects well on our nation.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we should be particularly conscious of the potential of the sector to provide opportunities for self expression and participation which can help to lift people&rsquo;s spirits in a time of economic difficulty.  We also appreciate the economic potential of the arts and creative industries and their role in supporting enterprise and innovation in the economy as a whole.  This is reflected in the motion which highlights the important fact the wider arts sector contributes &euro;4.7 billion to the national economy and directly supports 79,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>This is not merely rhetoric from our party&rsquo;s perspective.  Investment in arts, culture and the film sector in the period 2005 to 2010 came to more than &euro;1.1 billion.  In that time there was an unprecedented investment in national and regional arts and cultural infrastructure, performance venues and film and television production capacities.  It was money well spent.  Visitor numbers to the national cultural institutions grew by more than 75% and participation rates in the cultural and arts activities have increased.</P>
        <P>This motion reflects our belief that it would be irresponsible not to publish a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed changes before proceeding.  Some of these mergers were announced in budget 2009 but having listened to, researched and reflected on the views of stakeholders and experts in the field, I reiterate our belief that the independence and autonomy of the sector is crucial and must be maintained.  It has also been pointed out by the national campaign for the arts that experience from Canada and New Zealand indicates it costs millions to resource such mergers.  We should try to learn from the mistakes of others.  The views of Professor Diarmaid Ferriter also merit respect and I respect him as a historian and a person of principle.  He has written compelling articles, particularly in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 May, on the different functions carried out by the National Library and the National Archives.  I will not go through the detail of what he wrote but he identified the fundamentally different role and function of the National Library, on the one hand, which is the great custodian of our literary and estate manuscript collections, and the National Archives, the focus of which is solely on archives, most of them the files of Government Departments and so on.  The Minister should engage with the country&rsquo;s historians before proceeding with any decision to merge the National Library, the National Archives and Irish Manuscripts Commission.  The views of Professor Ferriter are worth reflecting on.  In my view, that was a clarion call to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and for people to take stock, review and reflect.</P>
        <P>Put simply, as this motion acknowledges, there would be a detrimental effect on our cultural infrastructure if the proposed mergers of these cultural arts institutions were to go ahead.  Senator Mac Conghail who spoke about this recently in the Seanad talked about &ldquo;a tsunami of desecration and potential undermining of the whole cultural infrastructure of our nation&rdquo;.  He is another person for whom I have respect, given his role in the arts and culture in recent years.  We should all listen carefully to what people of that calibre and reputation have to say.  I urge the Minister to accept the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>I am delighted to speak on this motion on the arts and culture.  My party and I thought it important to facilitate the House with an opportunity to debate this important sector given the debate that is currently taking place outside the House.  I welcome and thank the Deputies from other political parties and none who have signed our motion in support of arts and culture and also acknowledge that the Members of the Upper House will debate a similar motion tomorrow.  I welcome the visitors in the Gallery.  The numbers present highlight the concern of many people within this sector.</P>
        <P>The recent Indecon report shows that the arts provide significant direct and indirect employment.  The arts sector supports 21,300 jobs and contributes &euro;306.8 million in taxes but when the wider creative industry, such as film, animation, archives, museums etc, is included, the arts support 79,000 jobs and contribute &euro;4.7 billion to the economy annually.  Cultural tourism, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, now accounts for a spend of more than &euro;2 billion annually with very healthy projected double-digit increases year on year.  The Gathering in 2013 exemplifies a new tourism dynamic in which our cultural attractions, reputation for delivering outstanding artistic experiences and our cultural heritage will play a significant role.</P>
        <P>While not to diminish the value of economic activity and the importance of national solvency, we all live in a society, not an economy.  Contrary to popular belief, the arts are not a minority interest.  Recent figures show that 66% of the adult population are art attendees.  The Government has been at pains to say it is working extremely hard to rebuild our international reputation, a reputation that while in opposition it did not care much about when everything it did was politically motivated.</P>
        <P>Irish artists are internationally acclaimed, many having received very prestigious awards.  The Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney recently received the Griffin Poetry Prize for his lifetime achievements.  Similarly, Brendan O&rsquo;Carroll and other Irish actors brought many BAFTA awards back to Ireland earlier this year.  All these enhance our prestige and keep us in the spotlight.</P>
        <P>This year, the Imagine Ireland festival in the United States has sent thousands of artists to 40 states and they will join with hundreds of thousands of people and this will generate multi-million dollars worth of positive media coverage.</P>
        <P>Apart from the brand awareness which the arts create internationally, the arts play a pivotal role in our communities.  Recently members of the arts and culture committee received many presentations from various arts groups, varying from inner city groups that work with the disadvantaged, help create a sense of identity, confidence and help others live out their lives creatively to rural arts projects of which the same can be said.</P>
        <P>Sustained investment in infrastructure and capacity during the past decade has created a dynamic arts sector that produces in excess of 12,000 arts events and festivals annually.  When I think of my constituency I think of the magnificent work been carried out by the Mullingar Arts Centre, at which I attended an event on Saturday night and there was a full house, the Backstage Theatre in Longford and the Dean Crowe Centre in Athlone.  These are all venues supported by the Arts Council in conjunction with their local authorities and without such support they would not be in operation today.</P>
        <P>A group that encompasses international, national and community culture is Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute;&Eacute;ireann.  Down the years Comhaltas has promoted respect for all traditions on this island.  To underline this, Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann will be held in Derry next year where all traditions will be involved.  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann, which will be held in Cavan this year for the third year, attracts attendances of up to 300,000 people and generates &euro;40 million for the host region.</P>
        <P>As we approach a decade of commemoration, it is timely to take stock.  We must recognise the fundamental importance of cultural value as a component of public value.  Our pre-eminence on an international scale in terms of our cultural heritage has been a significant contributor to our national identity, pride and prestige.</P>
        <P>The national cultural institutions are our independent guardians of our cultural heritage.  The role of cultural institutions as political, institutional, cultural and social repositories of our collective history is vital to mediating and interpreting our history in order that it is widely appreciated and understood.  These institutions, many of which precede the founding of the State, will play a central role in mediating the experiences of 1916.  It will be a damning legacy of this Government if these institutions, so central to the narrative of our journey before and since Independence, were profoundly comprised as we approach the centenary of these many significant events in our national history.</P>
        <P>In light of this it is extremely disappointing that the Minister failed to engage in a swift, meaningful and purposeful consultation with the national cultural institutions.  This is not an accusation coming from an Opposition TD but it is what is been said about the Minister by the sector.  Meaningful consultation is essential for all effective reform.  The complete absence of an official framework through which the sector could effectively contribute to the formulation of effective and positive reform is of grave concern.  Consultation, such as it has been, has resulted from the political pressure in recent weeks.  In fact, many believe that were it not for the resignation of Professor Ferriter from the National Library, this issue would not be receiving the attention it deserves.</P>
        <P>Given where we currently are fiscally, the sector recognises the need for budgetary discipline and embraces the principle of reform.  The galleries, the National Gallery, IMMA and the Crawford Art Gallery, have submitted a document on where greater efficiencies can be achieved through shared services while at the same time retaining their own independence.</P>
        <P>It is essential that reform is evidence-based and takes account of international best practice.  It is essential that a thorough cost-benefit analysis on the proposed rationalisation of the national cultural institutions is conducted rigorously and in the public domain.  I pose the question to the Minister as to why a cost benefit analysis has not being carried out and, if one has been carried out, to identify the savings that these mergers would generate.  There are 113 national archives in the world and only two of them are merged with a national library.  The recent Canadian merger of these two institutions ended up costing an additional Canadian $15 million.  The independence and autonomy of the sector is crucial and political interference should be avoided at all costs.</P>
        <P>For more than 60 years, Governments have adhered to the arm&rsquo;s-length principle.  Successive Acts have enshrined the principle of independence of our cultural institutions.  That freedom is especially important in the arts, where the competencies, expertise and networks at both director and board level of cultural institutions are critical.  Sound governance, intellectual rigor and creative autonomy at the helm of our institutions is more important than political expediency or short-term budgetary outlooks, especially so in the decade of commemorations.  The then Minister for the Arts and now President Michael D. Higgins, introduced the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, allowing the National Library appoint its own independent board with the required expertise.  The current proposal would require existing Labour Party Deputies to rescind this legislation.</P>
        <P>The directors of the national cultural institutions have a significant cultural leadership role.  The sector insists on an open, transparent and independently adjudicated competition for director positions of each national cultural institution.  I do not mean to say that the newly appointed chief executive officer of Culture Ireland is not qualified for the post but it was an internal competition.  What happened to the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that all public appointments would be open to external candidates?</P>
        <P>If boards are merged or subsumed I ask where would this leave the plans for such a recruitment process and the succession plan for each and every national cultural institution.  How will our national cultural institutions respond to the challenges of the decade ahead if there is a leadership vacuum, given that by this time next year, four of the national cultural institutions will have been effectively decapitated, the National Library, the National Archives, the National Museum and Culture Ireland?  How does the Department propose to provide these institutions with the competencies, expertise, networks and vision formerly provided by independent directors and boards?  I ask what will be the cost of these boards.  Many people who served on the various boards offered their expertise for free to an institution which they loved and wished to see develop.  Independent boards are better placed to seek philanthropic donations and funding and they offer sound corporate governance.  If the proposed mergers go ahead, it will lead to an erosion of institutional independence and an over-reaching on the part of the Department in the work of these institutions.  I question whether the Department even has the capacity to take on the additional work.</P>
        <P>This proposal highlights the cultural policy vacuum created by this Government and profoundly compromises the capacity of these institutions to deliver on their core mission of providing public access to our cultural assets.  In the absence of a cost-benefit analysis and a vision statement, we do not know how these new proposals will deliver a better service, offer better access to the public or increase the visitor numbers to these institutions.  I urge all Members to support this motion and I look forward to listening to contributions from the Minister and other Members.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Noel Grealish and Mattie McGrath.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the arts.  I will support the motion because the positive contribution of the arts to society has not been recognised and at times has been misrepresented.  Our cultural heritage has a significant impact on the economy of the country and many Irish artists are famous on the world stage.  I support the national campaign for the arts in its efforts to protect and develop the significant talent pool in this country.  I support the indirect and direct employment provided by the arts and creative industries with a total of 95,649 jobs.  I also welcome the positive contribution of the 5,500 full-time jobs in the audiovisual sector, with more than 560 small and medium enterprises operating in this sector.  I welcome the significant contribution by the arts sector to tourism, investment and jobs.  The arts provide an investment of &euro;4.7 billion to the economy.</P>
        <P>I wish to pay tribute to those who provide art therapy in schools in poor and disadvantaged areas, thereby assisting children at risk.  Recently published reports have highlighted the need for caring for children at risk.  I also pay tribute to those involved in music and drama who develop the arts in poorer communities.  Such activities and involvement lift the communities and develop self-esteem among the people.</P>
        <P>The anniversary of the battle of Clontarf will be commemorated in 2014 and the 1916 Rising commemoration will be held in 2016.  Such events will provide significant potential for tourism and the arts.</P>
        <P>A nation which does not nurture, protect and develop its artists is a nation without a soul and a nation lacking direction.  I urge all Deputies to support the motion tomorrow night at 9 p.m.</P>

        <P>I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for sharing his time with me so that I may speak on this important motion.  I am fortunate to represent an area in which the arts have deep roots.  In the late 1990s, Galway city was the fastest expanding city in Europe and key to this expansion was the appetite for exploration of the arts.  Reputations were built and businesses blossomed.  Figures show that the Galway Arts Festival is worth in excess of &euro;20 million to the city and county.  Over 150,000 people attend the festival, with more than 50% being visitors from outside Galway.  The Galway Film Fleadh has the same capacity to draw in excess of 20,000 people to the city and it is worth in excess of &euro;5 million to the city every year.  The Galway races attract more than 170,000 people to our city and it is worth in excess of &euro;60 million.  This year, the final leg of the Volvo Ocean Race will finish in Galway, and it will bring in excess of &euro;70 million to the city.  I thank John Killeen, the president of the Volvo Ocean Race committee, and Enda &Oacute; Coinnean the chief executive officer, for their tremendous work.  I hope Deputies, Ministers and the Taoiseach will visit the city during the event.</P>
        <P>Top productions are being staged in Galway theatres.  Last year the Town Hall theatre and the Druid Theatre Company benefited to the tune of &euro;150,000 from the Arts Council.  I acknowledge the support given by both the previous Government and this Government to the Arts Council and also to the Volvo Ocean Race.  The list of events is endless.  Galway City Council also provides support to the arts and culture by means of the allocation of funding to the many projects which have helped to create a solid reputation for Galway city and county and which is recognised nationwide and throughout the world.</P>
        <P>Galway has excellent third-level facilities.  Earlier this year, NUI Galway announced an investment of &euro;75 million in the creation of three world-class research buildings, including the arts, humanities and social services research building.  An extension costing &euro;8 million is being developed for the Millennium building.  The vice president in charge of capital projects at NUI Galway, Ken Warnock, noted in January that the university was currently investing &euro;750,000 per year in Galway.</P>
        <P>If Galway is to be the postcard for the west of Ireland then it is vital that this postcard does not become a collector&rsquo;s item.  It is our responsibility as public representatives to do everything possible to allow the arts, culture and heritage sector to flourish.</P>

        <P>I compliment the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for tabling this motion and I thank the Deputies for sharing time with us.</P>
        <P>I believe in a society that values creativity, imagination and expression.  The arts enrich our lives.  Everyone should be given the opportunity to participate and enjoy the arts and to appreciate the value of the arts, which is more important.</P>
        <P>I come from a proud county, south Tipperary &mdash; Tipperary now &mdash; where we value our arts, culture and heritage.  The Minister was in Tipperary last week in Athassel abbey looking at the wonderful architectural heritage and praising the work in south Tipperary under the chairmanship of Michael Fitzgerald and arts officer, Lisa McKenna.  They have done excellent work and I am shocked to think the Minister is the same man who is introducing this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I have the floor, Minister.  We know what you are doing.</P>
        <P>South Tipperary arts centre did brilliant work with many household names such as Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute;&Eacute;ireann and Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;.  The Minister was on Matt Cooper&rsquo;s show earlier today &mdash; chuala m&eacute;&eacute; sin.  The Minister is not marking Jimmy Barry Murphy now; it is a different situation.  The Minister talks about jobs.  I compliment Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and his bean ch&eacute;ile, &Uacute;na, for the arts, culture and heritage they have promoted in south Tipperary, right beside the Rock of Cashel.  They give so much expression to so many young people in music, song and dance and folklore.  They have an archive covering the whole country.</P>
        <P>We also have the Clonmel Junction Festival, which does tremendous work, Col&aacute;iste Cois Suire in my village and an &Eacute;igse for S&eacute;amus &Oacute; Maolchathaigh this weekend.  Huge work has been put into it in my local village of Newcastle.  I compliment everybody there and on the research done on the brilliant book <i>An Gleann agus a Raibh Ann</i>.  Sin &eacute; an t&iacute;r at&aacute; ann and the Minister should leave us alone and support the arts.  He should not be like every other Minister in this Government.  Whatever arrogance has got into them over the year, they just want to destroy what is good and attack anything people enjoy and from which they derive creativity, support and stimulation.  We should be supporting these groups.</P>
        <P>The Minister is trying to amalgamate three bodies that are doing great work.  We already have boards that should be abolished and an bord snip recommended that we get rid of quangos.  This area is not where that policy should be focused.  These groups are willing, ready and able to amalgamate or co-operate to the fullest extent.  They are not costing any money.  The value we get from them as taxpayers is how they attract foreign direct investment, film making and tourists who come here to enjoy the arts.  The cultural institutions that have served us so well must be left alone.  The National Art Gallery, Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, and the Crawford Art Gallery have expressed their desire to work more closely in the future.</P>
        <P>We have seen what has happened with L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig, our patron saint&rsquo;s day, which can command audiences of millions worldwide.  The same is true of the activities and attractions of the GAA.  The Bealtaine Festival is one of the most recent festivals and hundreds of thousands of people took part.  People might be downtrodden financially but they are ready to express themselves culturally and, indeed, economically by creating and generating jobs.  The Taoiseach, like the rest of us, is promoting The Gathering, but these groups cannot be suppressed.  The centenary commemoration of the Rising will take place in 2016 and there will be many other commemorations, including in Tipperary.  We must support and enhance them.  The Minister must allow the Irish people who have such a wealth and depth of culture, energy, passion and enthusiasm to express those qualities.  They should not be further downtrodden.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I support this motion as it raises important points regarding the manner in which the cultural heritage sector is coming under pressure from the cuts that are being imposed.  It will be argued by some that museums and other cultural infrastructure are in some way luxuries that we cannot afford to support to the same extent during an economic downturn.  Some would even argue that they perhaps should not be supported at all.  If that were the case, culture would revert to becoming once again the preserve of the wealthy who can afford to buy cultural artefacts.  In fairness, Dublin and other cities are witness to the fact that wealthy people such as the Carnegies were willing to spend considerable amounts of money providing libraries and other facilities to people who would otherwise not have been able to afford books or to pay to see paintings or historical material.  It is, therefore, essential for a variety of reasons that funding for the cultural heritage sector is maintained.</P>
        <P>I will address the issue of the proposed merger of the three art museums and galleries, of the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission and of the National Library with the National Museum.  Despite the reasons that have been given, and will no doubt be offered again this evening, the mergers are purely designed to save money.  They will also, in the opinion of those most familiar with the institutions concerned, have a malign impact on them.  The National Library and the National Archives play a crucial role in historical and other research in this country.  Their ability to provide that service has already been restricted by cutbacks which have affected staffing levels and, consequently, access by the public to the materials under their care.  Subjecting them to cost cutting mergers will further exacerbate the damage that has been done.  While that might appear to be a minor issue in comparison to the overall impact of the austerity programme, restricting access to research material will have a damaging affect on the level of university work and, indeed, on the production of new historical and other research by people who use the National Archives and the National Library.  I second the call in the motion to reject the proposed mergers.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to the not insignificant economic impact of the arts sector and the large number of jobs which are dependent upon it.  That is something that could be expanded.  Cultural tourism is a growing area and one that is still under-developed in this country.  We could also take a leaf from the book of the American New Dealers of the 1930s who invested considerable resources in developing the American cultural heritage through the collection of folk music and so on.  There are many areas of our cultural heritage, including cultural sites and source materials, that remain under-developed and under-researched.  Investing money in doing that would not only enrich our cultural resources, but would also create jobs directly, boost cultural tourism and contribute to creating other jobs.</P>

        <P>Mo bhu&iacute;ochas do Fhianna F&aacute;il gur chuir siad an r&uacute;n seo s&iacute;os.  I will first declare an interest as I am a director of F&eacute;ile an Phobail, the west Belfast people&rsquo;s festival, which is an unpaid position.  I cannot imagine life without the arts, without music, dance, theatre, writing, language, our customs and traditions and all that makes us a people.  Gan seo bheim&iacute;s gan anam.  Sin mo bhar&uacute;il in aon chor.</P>
        <P>I commend Professor Diarmaid Ferriter on his principled stand in protest against the Government&rsquo;s proposal to merge several key national institutions.  However, the Government does not appear to have any intention of listening to or of allowing the views of the cultural sector into its considerations.  It appears that the Government believes that it, and only it, will determine the future of our nation&rsquo;s cultural and artistic heritage.  This is wrong.  The arts in any society are unique because they encompass all that is creative and good about the human condition.  They occupy a special place which should be guarded, protected, independent and free from political interference.</P>
        <P>The National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, which was initiated by President Michael D. Higgins when he was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, envisaged such safeguards.  However, since the McCarthy report and since the Government started implementing austerity measures, there is real concern across the arts and cultural sector, among scholars and in civil society about the future of the arts.  I formed the view some time ago, and before he was appointed the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, was well disposed to the arts.  In fairness, he is a fine writer, an artist in his own right and a proud Kerryman steeped in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy.  That is very positive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
        <P>T&aacute; sin ceart.  Sin mo bhar&uacute;il agus t&aacute; a fhios sin ag an Aire fosta.</P>
        <P>However, I take this opportunity to remind the Minister that apart from the intrinsic value of our culture and its components, the arts and cultural sector makes an important contribution to the tourism industry.  It is just bad economics to undermine the sector.  Community arts projects, local libraries and other grassroots institutions lift people out of themselves, enrich their lives and empower them.  Recently on the world stage, Terry and Oorlagh George&rsquo;s Oscar winning film, &ldquo;The Shore&rdquo;, was a great example of how this island produces winners.  As we face a decade of commemoration, it is imperative that the Minister recognises the central role of culture and the arts in shaping Irish identity.</P>
        <P>I am also part of another organisation, the Bobby Sands Trust.  It has put historically important archival material from the H-blocks and the Armagh protests into the National Archives.  I am sure there is other archive material dating back to the Black and Tans war, the Civil War and what happened to Unionism in this State.  There is a need to join that with what is happening in the Six Counties.I urge the Minister to join with the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North, Caral N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, in discussing an all-lreland strategy to use the arts and culture in the promotion of understanding and national reconciliation.</P>
        <P>In concluding, I will quote from the mission statement of the National Archives of Ireland.  It states: &ldquo;...the Archive&rsquo;s holdings relate to all parts of Ireland...and provide essential source material for people seeking to understand the political, economic and social forces which have shaped our nation.&rdquo;  It is imperative that we preserve and safeguard this.  In all that we do, the safeguarding, protection and preservation of imagination and creativity must replace any notion of a State-centred oneness or bureaucratic control over these fine institutions.  I commend the motion and thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling it.  I ask the Minister to support it also.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am pleased to be here this evening to contribute to this debate on our national cultural institutions.  It is a healthy sign of a vibrant society, an engaged legislature and a robust democracy when a Privmate Members&rsquo; business debate is about arts, culture and our cultural institutions even if the tone of the debate has been rather negative and not well informed at times.</P>
        <P>If artists, writers and choreographers are the trustees of civilisation, our cultural institutions are the keepers of that civilisation.  The desire to make and experience art is an organic part of human nature.  Without it, our lives are impoverished and our sense of community is diminished.  Our national cultural institutions enrich and enhance all of our lives.  Some have done so for more than a century and a half, as in the case of the National Gallery.  My objective in Government is to make the arts and culture part of our national script and a central and essential part of the narrative about the character of a new, different, changed and better Ireland.</P>
        <P>The subject of this evening&rsquo;s debate arises in the broader context of the Government&rsquo;s public service reform plan, published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, last November.  That process constitutes a central part of bringing about necessary reform in the way we do things.  It is important to note that, in a time of tight resources and when we have to maximise the use of every cent taxpayers give to every institution, no organisation is above examination for reform.  The periodic examination of organisations, especially those receiving money from the taxpayer, is a healthy and necessary exercise.</P>
        <P>The public service reform plan aims to deliver enhanced service efficiencies and a more focused and democratically accountable public service.  The plan notes that the Government also recognises that shared services have the potential to transform the competitiveness of State bodies, and will actively pursue this issue.  Sharing of back office administrative functions such as human resources, IT, payroll, procurement and other services will offer significant long-term savings in the operation of State bodies generally.</P>
        <P>My Department has adopted the following broad approach towards the implementation of the reform plan in so far as it relates to bodies under its aegis: the establishment of a high level reform committee to oversee the process of implementing the Government&rsquo;s decisions in these matters as effectively and efficiently as possible; written consultations and meetings with bodies, as appropriate; consideration of previous evaluations, where relevant; consultation with key stakeholders; examination of submissions made; and meetings with the directors and senior management of bodies, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>We do a lot of things well in Ireland.  In the realm of arts and culture we are world class but one thing we could do better is to have a calm and cool debate about the future direction of organisations that are funded by the taxpayer and are in place to serve the nation.  I know and understand these institutions.  I have engaged with them throughout my life.  My door is always open to those who wish to share their views on the future direction of these institutions, and our arts and culture policy more generally.  It is a matter of regret that some chose not to use that door and, instead, chose to address me indirectly through the media.  I also want to be clear that the public service reform proposals are not in any way a reflection on the dedication, professionalism and commitment of the staff or those who serve on the boards of the institutions involved.</P>
        <P>The national cultural institutions, which hold, manage and expand nationally and internationally important collections of art, literature and diverse artifacts on everyone&rsquo;s behalf, are vitally important components of Ireland&rsquo;s academic, cultural, documentary and archaeological heritage.  These institutions are the custodians of our past, chroniclers of our present and the arbiters of our future.  Some recent commentary has suggested that I am planning to effectively dismantle these organisations.  That was repeated here this evening.  I am planning no such thing nor, for that matter, is the Government.  I want to make that clear.</P>
        <P>My Department funds these institutions, not as much as I would like but as much as I can.  This year, eight core institutions, including the galleries, museum, library and archives, will receive a total of more than &euro;41 million.  That is approximately one third of the arts, culture and film budget of my Department.  In addition, the Abbey Theatre will receive more than &euro;7 million, approximately one ninth of the current Arts Council allocation.</P>
        <P>These institutions are world class in what they do.  They rank ahead of many illustrious international peers.  I accept fully that they could do more with more money.  However, the funding challenges that I face in my Department are significant.  Deputy Martin, as part of a number of Governments, created the conditions that left me in this position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Yet the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>The challenge I am faced with is how to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s national cultural institutions can optimize the funding they receive from the taxpayer and be equipped to deal with the range of issues which will arise in the future.</P>
        <P>One of the simplest ways in which we can help the institutions to work in a more effective, efficient and co-operative way is to encourage them to share or draw on common services.  Many of the institutions have individual marketing and human resource departments, while institutions also purchase services like security and insurance which may, if pooled, drive down total spending over time.  That is a common sense approach to co-operation and reform.</P>
        <P>The three main galleries &mdash; the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and the Crawford Gallery &mdash; have put a detailed proposal together on how support and operational services can be shared, and this is being considered.  It goes without saying that the remit and independence of each of these institutions would not change under these proposals.  The National Gallery would continue to show historically important artwork while the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, would retain its focus on contemporary work.  Importantly, the institutions concerned would continue to decide what to exhibit and where to exhibit it.</P>
        <P>There has been much recent commentary about the National Library, the National Museum and the National Archives, and we had a repeat of that here this evening.  I would point out that the National Archives is part of my Department.  It is headed by a director with statutory independence, advised by a voluntary board whose members offer their time <i>pro bono</i>, and in this structure does excellent and independent work.  It has shown the way on-line to all cultural institutions, with its award winning digitisation of the 1901 and 1911 census returns.  The National Archives raised &euro;0.25 million in philanthropy in the past 12 months to fund a digitisation project.</P>
        <P>Mention was made of Diarmaid Ferriter.  While he resigned from the National Library board he remains on the National Archives Advisory Council.  I am glad he chose to remain on the National Archives Advisory Council.  Clearly he has a lot to offer.</P>
        <P>The National Museum and the National Library, institutions in existence since 1887, worked in a similar way until 2005.  I am considering a range of options for these institutions such as whether the sharing of support functions can streamline the way they operate or whether they would operate more efficiently if those support functions were delivered by my Department which, for example, already manages human resources functions for other institutions, such as the National Archives.</P>
        <P>Importantly, at a time of ongoing economic difficulty, I want to examine the governance of institutions and consider how boards or advisory groups might perform a more outwardly proactive and international role in terms of fund-raising and philanthropy.  In this time of diminished funding from the taxpayer, it would be imprudent of me not to examine all of the structures to see if they are fit for the new reality we face in arts and culture funding in the 21st century.  These institutions are our national collective memory, our cultural treasuries, and our legacy to future generations.  In a situation where these institutions are funded virtually 100% by the taxpayer, the Government has a responsibility to subject them to periodic review.</P>
        <P>Some commentary in this House and outside has focused on the curatorial and programming independence of the institutions.  There is no question of them being undermined.  Our counter motion recognises and supports this independence.  There has been ongoing contact and engagement with the cultural institutions since the Government published its public service reform plan last November.  That contact is continuing.  I personally met the chairs of all national cultural institutions, along with the Arts Council and Culture Ireland, to discuss these issues and hear their views.  Therefore it is inaccurate and disingenuous to say consultation has not taken place.  It has.</P>
        <P>Before I finish, I cannot allow this evening to pass without remarking that the authors of this motion appear to have forgotten their own recent history.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>No we did not.  We set it out at the beginning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>That is somewhat ironic given that their motion focuses on our national cultural institutions, which are themselves the guardians of both our history and our historic treasures.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge, that as Deputy Martin said, the previous Government, in the budget of 2009, proposed structural changes to the national cultural institutions, although I understand that was done without any consultation with the institutions beforehand.  Then it went on to prepare the heads of a Bill to make that change happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>And appointed boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>In 2010, the previous Minister made appointments to the boards of institutions for &ldquo;a period of five years or until the restructuring of the institutions takes place, whichever is the sooner&rdquo;.  Therefore, she had every intention of carrying out this reform as part of the Government of which Deputy Martin was part.  Now, the Deputy is trying to distance himself from that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>No, I made it very clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>Reform was clearly on the agenda, but that is conveniently forgotten now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>It is within the Minister&rsquo;s capacity to change policy.  I am quite entitled to reflect that the Minister should do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy does not know what I am doing yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>I have listened to the debate. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;speak&rdquo; very well.  The Minister should use the opportunity to tell us what he is going to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Allow the Minister to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>Reform was clearly on the agenda, but that is conveniently forgotten for reasons of political expediency.  I have been in this House for a long number of years and whenever there was discussion on the arts, there was magnanimity.  People bought into it and we supported the arts.  I was the spokesman on the arts for a number of years and was always positive.  Although I was in opposition for years, I did not use that as an excuse to do nothing for the arts.  I have been steeped in the arts for the past 30 years and I have the projects to show for it.  Nobody can question my commitment to the arts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>Anyway, reform was clearly on the agenda, but that is conveniently forgotten now, for reasons of political expediency.  Nonetheless, I will continue with the process which is under way to examine all reform options before me that are part of the public service reform plan.  I cannot accept the idea that examining the possibilities here amounts to an attack on the cultural infrastructure of the nation, as suggested by some.  The idea that any organisation or institution should be above examination for reform is a recipe for a bad deal for the taxpayer who funds it.</P>
        <P>As I said at the outset, the periodic examination of organisations, especially those receiving money from the taxpayer, is a healthy and necessary exercise.  The national cultural institutions perform a very important role and manage, on our behalf, a resource which is literally priceless.  I want to ensure that they can work in the most effective and efficient way possible and that they can cope with the challenges they will face in the future.  It is my intention that our cultural institutions emerge stronger into a more certain future following this process, so that for the coming generations they can continue to preserve our past and inform our future.</P>
        <P>Mention was made of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the arts.  The Taoiseach appointed two people who are here this evening, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail and Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell.  Obviously, they organised all those in the Visitors Gallery to attend this debate.  It shows how magnanimous the Government is that it appointed these two people as representatives of the arts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>We thought so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am proud of that.  I am glad we appointed both of them to the Seanad to represent the arts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Will he listen to them now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>If we did not have that commitment, they and others like them would not be appointed to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Be tolerant of debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am in office just over a year.  We have been left in very difficult financial circumstances, but I reduced funding to the Arts Council by just over 3% last year &mdash; the smallest reduction since 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Maith an fear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
        <P>Hopefully, some of the arts organisations represented here tonight will benefit from that.  I look forward to hearing suggestions about how we can move forward.  Nothing is decided yet, but I want to hear positive proposals here this evening and tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
        <P>Keep the boards and be tolerant.</P>

        <P>I thank Deputy Adams for what he said here this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It goes without saying that of all people, the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the arts cannot be questioned.  As a Deputy in a neighbouring constituency to his and having inherited part of the constituency he had, I know of his commitment to Listowel and Tralee and I know he is by no means afraid to stand up for the arts community.</P>
        <P>This motion is quite cynical, particularly in light of the way it has been tabled.  Until recently, I was a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We engaged with local authorities with regard to how the arts could be part of local authorities.  Many of those speaking here extolled the virtue of what they believed should be done, but none of those people was seen at the committee meetings.  That is regrettable, because the committee provided a great forum.  It was chaired by our colleague, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and provided an opportunity for Deputies of all sides to bring forward suggestions and question those involved in the arts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government has destroyed the committees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
        <P>However, these people did not attend the committee and for them to come in and table a motion this evening is just a cynical exercise and is trying to beat Sinn F&eacute;in in a race to the bottom.  That does nothing for the arts.</P>
        <P>What the Minister said is right.  We are in the middle of a consultation process and it is a bit ironic and premature for anybody to try to pre-empt the Minister&rsquo;s decision.  That is particularly the case when it is a party that is trying to restructure itself and to present itself as credible.  It is ironic that it will come out and oppose the consolidation and rationalisation of back office services without coming up with any credible solutions as to where to find the &euro;15 billion for the hole it created.  Week in and out we come in here for Private Members&rsquo; Business and listen to Fianna F&aacute;il oppose everything.  That is grand, because Fianna F&aacute;il must take on Sinn F&eacute;in.

        <P>It would be nice if they came in every now and again and put forward a proposal.  I come from a county that is not synonymous with the promotion of tourism.  We do not have the mountains Deputy Deenihan has in Kerry and do not have the lakes found in the midlands.  However, we have small but very good local arts community initiatives all over the county.  These are driven by two people in Limerick County Council, to whom I must pay tribute.  They have very small budgets, but are able to achieve a lot.  In relative terms the cuts brought in as part of last year&rsquo;s budget were not excessive and not beyond what other Departments have had to take.  Ultimately, we need to get back to reality.  We have cultural institutions that are second to none, most of which are open to the public six or seven days every week and which are free of charge.  I compliment the Minister and the cultural institutions, many of which are managed by the Office of Public Works.  Many have a significant voluntary input as well.  We should reconsider the motion and in this regard I welcome the amendment proposed by the Government.  The Armageddon situation from some on the Opposition benches to the effect that the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government is trying to do away with the arts does not stack up.</P>

        <P>They have come up with some good lines before but, even for them, that is a good one.  They must have been scratching their heads when they put together the motion.  They opted not to engage with the committee set up to consider the issue or with the Minister.  They should accept the fact that there is a budget deficit of the order of &euro;15 billion from which savings must be made and they should come up with suggestions.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il accepts this but I am unsure about the Independent Deputies and Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>I tabled 15 parliamentary questions last week relating to the number of non-governmental organisations and other bodies that have been merged, scrapped or subsumed into other Departments or organisations to make savings.</P>

        <P>It is important to have an informed debate.  We should realise that a significant amount of money has been invested by the State in cultural institutions.  None of these is being closed and none will have their services reduced from existing levels.  The Minister is simply proposing a rationalisation of the back office services to cut out duplication and multiplicity and to make savings for the taxpayer in order that we need not make them in other Departments.  The Minister should be complimented on this and supported on it rather than the usual gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute; from the Opposition of opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
        <P>As a Deputy for Galway I know at first hand of the positive impact the arts and culture sectors have on our communities and our country.  Galway is fortunate to have some of Ireland&rsquo;s best known festivals and arts organisations, including the Galway Arts Festival, the Clifden Arts Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the C&uacute;irt International Festival of Literature, the Babor&oacute; International Arts Festival for Children, the Druid Theatre Company, Macnas and F&iacute;b&iacute;n Teoranta as well as the top-class Galway City Museum and countless other groups.  These organisations not only boost our economy by providing employment and attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors, but they enrich our communities and protect and promote our linguistic and cultural heritage.</P>
        <P>Galway is closely associated with the arts and has a reputation as an artistic centre.  One need only walk down Shop Street on a summer&rsquo;s day to see the buskers and street artists entertaining the crowds of tourists.  The Clifden Arts Festival, officially opened last year by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, will hold its 35th festival on 29-30 September and everyone in the House is welcome to a wonderful ten days in Clifden and Connemara.  The world famous Galway Arts Festival runs this year from 16-29 July followed by the wonderful Galway Races.  This is the line-up for a summer and autumn of culture and sport in Galway, all of which is preceded by the final of the Volvo Ocean Race beginning this weekend.  The arts is concerned with identity.  It stimulates debate, encourages exploration, showcases our nation on the world stage and informs our actions on many other levels, including policy formulation.</P>
        <P>One example of this is Galway playwright Tom Murphy whose works are currently being staged by the Abbey Theatre and in Galway and London by the Galway-based Druid Theatre Company.  Many of the Murphy&rsquo;s plays, including &ldquo;The House&rdquo; are concerned with emigration and its effects on communities, those who left and those who stayed, and on Irish identity.  Although &ldquo;The House&rdquo; concentrates on emigration, it also encourages us to reflect on the effects of domestic violence through a minor sub-plot.  It exemplifies the power of the arts to prompt debate and inspire action in a way no official publicity campaign could.</P>
        <P>Naturally, the arts and cultural sectors cannot be treated separately in the context of our financial difficulties.  Almost all areas of spending must be examined and savings must be realised if we are to reduce our deficit.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party motion refers to its investment in the sectors between 2005 and 2010 but it ignores the reality of 2009 and 2010 when significant cuts were implemented.  For example, the grants for the National Archives and National Library of Ireland are specifically referred to in the motion but they were cut by 16% and 13% respectively.  This was matched by a cut of 18% in the allocation for the National Museum of Ireland and a 48% cut in the cultural infrastructure budget in 2010.  Had better management of the public finances taken place during the past decade it is doubtful whether such cuts would have been necessary.  The creation of separate boards of directors for various State-supported organisations such as the National Museum and the National Library of Ireland is also open to question.</P>
        <P>A balanced approach in terms of reviewing the financial support from the State is important.  It is encouraging to note that the public service reform plan adopted by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is based on liaising and consulting with the various organisations, on meeting collectively and individually and on examining not the content or artistic approach but the models of administration, management and governance.  I welcome this approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelConaghan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Conaghan</NameTxt>
        <P>I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the cultural and arts institutions referred to in the motion.  Their work in safeguarding our cultural and artistic legacies and in retaining these legacies in tangible forms requires great skill and professionalism.  Their work is at the heart of securing the transmission of culture to new generations.  I pay tribute to the staff of this sector for their remarkable curatorial and allied skills.</P>
        <P>All this endeavour has a measurable economic by-product.  Overseas tourists have a yearning to encounter and experience the artistic and cultural sensibilities, temperament and genius of this part of the world.  This is why 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural and historical visits while in Ireland during 2008.  I read with interest a recent report by The Heritage Council entitled The Economic Value of Ireland&rsquo;s Historic Environment.  The key finding of this report was that our historical environment supports almost 40,000 jobs and accounts for approximately &euro;1.5 billion in gross value added to the economy.  Similarly, research by the National Campaign for the Arts shows that the total of direct and indirect employment supported by the arts and creative industries amounts to 79,000 jobs.  Direct Exchequer revenue from the cultural and creative sectors in 2008 was approximately &euro;1 billion.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is fully aware of these figures and of the economic value of the sector as well as the other values to which I referred earlier.  No decision on the merger of arts and cultural institutions can or should be taken in isolation from these facts.</P>
        <P>One glaring shortcoming is the treatment of our material culture, in particular our meagre efforts to preserve our technological and industrial past.  I have raised this issue previously in the D&aacute;il and with individual Ministers and stakeholders.  I have worked for many years to build a partnership for the creation of a national railway and industrial heritage museum in the grounds of the great Inchicore railway works.  I am pleased to report that Irish Rail, Dublin City Council and the National Museum of Ireland have expressed their support and they are beginning to work towards a plan for the realisation of such a facility.  I hope the Minister and the Government will lend their support to this long overdue project.  I believe that outstanding examples of our industrial crafts and great moments in our history of technological innovation are worthy of retention and celebration.</P>
        <P>The notion that the Government has an ulterior motive in taking these necessary and difficult decisions is cynical.  It reflects the selective memory of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which is keen to use the arts and culture sectors to paper over its political shortcomings and short-sightedness.  These decisions can only be properly understood in the context of the economic catastrophe in which a Fianna F&aacute;il Government landed us and the disastrous blanket bank guarantee of September 2008 to which Sinn F&eacute;in added its signature.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelConaghan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Conaghan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, is doing his best to ensure that what money we can afford to allocate to the arts and heritage is used as efficiently and effectively as possible.  If savings can be made through the sharing of services and the reform of governance, it will help to avoid other cuts which might have a more detrimental impact on the excellent work of our arts and cultural institutions.  I support the Minister in his work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
        <P>This is a time of enormous flux and uncertainty for the country and its citizens but certain constants remain, among which are our cultural, literary and artistic heritage.  The ongoing debate about national identity and sovereignty that continued today with the publication of the van Rompuy pre-summit report &mdash; I am speaking in the right debate &mdash; has profound importance for the country but, arising from what is happening in Europe, we may at some point in the future decide it is in our national interest to pool more of our political and economic sovereignty.  While we have already done so to a considerable extent we may yet agree to pool more.  However, we will never have to pool or give up any aspect of our cultural or artistic heritage.  It is ours and the only threat that exists to it is the possibility that we may fail to protect and nurture it sufficiently.  That is entirely in our own hands and there will be no one else to blame if we fail in our responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that the House has traditionally taken a non-partisan approach on this issue.  All the parties in this House that have been in government have acted to protect our cultural and artistic heritage.  At a time of severe financial crisis we have to work together to ensure this work is not undone in any way, even unwittingly.  We should assess reform proposals carefully and sensitively because what we are dealing with is more precious than practically anything else.</P>
        <P>The issue of the independence and autonomy of the cultural institutions has been raised.  I support those who say they should be valued and maintained.  The legislation introduced in 1997 by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, President Michael D. Higgins, was progressive in nature.  As he pointed out, every report commissioned since the 1920s concluded that the departmental structure was a poor basis for managing and developing the National Museum and the National Library.  We should be slow to do anything that might change or undermine the autonomy of either of those institutions.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin could not resist the opportunity to cut quickly to the political advantage he thought he might extract by suggesting the Government is acting dishonestly.  The Deputy comes from a party that made a premium out of dishonesty.  There was a time when it was impossible to know whether one could believe anything that party said.  There were even times when one assumed the truth was the opposite of what it said.  We are carefully, honestly and rationally considering what we have to do in respect of all our institutions, including our cultural institutions.  Deputy Martin utterly lacks credibility when he claims that his party was about to take the same approach but never got around to it and is now opposed to it.  He should look to his own party when he speaks about honesty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is deeply concerned about the proposal to merge the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland.  We are also opposed to the proposed merger of the National Archives and The Irish Manuscripts Commission, any change in the arm&rsquo;s length principle or any proposal that would interfere with the independence of key artistic and cultural institutions.  These proposals, if carried through, would have a lasting and detrimental impact on the arts and cultural sector in Ireland.  In this sense the proposals are clearly not thought through.  They are little more than an exercise in optics by a Government that is obsessed with reducing the numbers of quangos and cost cutting, even when such a strategy makes no sense.</P>
        <P>Even though the Government has not produced any information in terms of a cost-benefit analysis or head count reductions to justify the proposed changes it is hell bent on embarking on a process of amalgamations, mergers, dissolution of independent boards and non-renewal of vital leadership roles.  However, the real elephant in the room in terms of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals is that the State&rsquo;s arts and cultural institutions are not and never were quangos.  They are part of the DNA of the Irish State.  Their very uniqueness is what makes us who we are as a people.  The arts and cultural institutions are, in essence, the key producers of Irish identity.  At a time of fiscal austerity, cutbacks, mass unemployment and national despondency the arts offer a valuable creative outlet for people.  Just over 1.2 million people regularly engage in artistic or creative activities.  Approximately 2 million people, or 57% of the adult population, are regular arts attenders.  In a mature society that values expression and creativity the arts have the potential to enrich lives.  They make us more human and help us to think about the world and our place in it in a more imaginative, innovative and abstract way.  In this time of great harshness and fiscal cruelty we should be protecting and investing in the arts.</P>
        <P>Irish artists enhance our international reputation through movie screens, bookshelves, theatres and concert stages.  This presence, for which Irish artists regularly win internationally recognised awards, plays an important role in creating and sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s global reputation and, in turn, drives tourism from abroad.  Approximately 1.6 million overseas tourists attended museums and galleries in 2010 and a further 433,000 attended festivals and other cultural events.  Cultural tourism is worth over &euro;2 billion to the Irish economy and is the only growth area of the tourism market.  At a more fundamental level the arts and cultural institutions are priceless.  The arts have a humanising effect on society by bringing softness, imagination and creativity to communities that have been forgotten in economic and infrastructural terms by those in power.  The arts have the potential to soften urban wastelands and give hope and human solace to people who feel betrayed by the political system.  If the Minister visited the National Museum or the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork he would do so without paying not because he is the Minister but because these institutions are free of charge to everyone.  This fact makes them unique and valuable in societal terms.</P>
        <P>I realise the Minister has a personal interest in the arts and I acknowledge his hard work and dedication to the sector but he needs to respect the arm&rsquo;s length principle by immediately engaging in a process of consultation with the national cultural institutions and to meeting representatives of the National Campaign for the Arts.  I ask why he has thus far failed to establish an independent recruitment process for the CEO vacancies in the key cultural institutions.  These positions are crucial to the day-to-day operations of the institutions.  I call on him to establish immediately an independent recruitment process to fill the vacancies without further delay.</P>
        <P>Who will benefit from these proposed mergers and, by extension, the abolition of autonomous governance of cultural institutions?  It will hardly be the taxpayers and the general public.  Instead, as Diarmaid Ferriter has noted: &ldquo;Those in power will have undermined the very thing we need to prize and cherish at a time of national crisis &mdash; the robust, independent protection of our culture and history, a history that is founded on its libraries and archives and the preservation of its public and private documents.&rdquo;  The heritage and culture of Ireland belong to all of the people on the island of Ireland.  The Government of the day has a responsibility to preserve and foster this heritage.  It is the caretaker of our cultural and artistic heritage and its role is to safeguard and preserve it for the next generation.  This is particularly important as we begin the decade of commemoration and enter a new era for our national identity.  It is imperative that we have independent, robust and well funded national artistic and cultural institutions.  Only then can the various commemorations be seen as an opportunity to revisit our past with the express aim of building a more equal and caring society.</P>
        <P>Mergers of archives and libraries require investment and should not be seen by short-sighted bureaucrats as an opportunity for cost cutting and savings.  For example, the merger of the libraries and archives in Canada cost CA$15 million.  No one in the National Archives of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland objects to the idea of shared resources or co-operating in common fields of interest but the two bodies perform very different functions.  The Minister must acknowledge this and must recognise that their unique character makes these institutions invaluable national assets.  The library has custody of our great literary and estate manuscript collections and is an important public resource.</P>
        <P>The focus of the National Archives of Ireland is solely on archives, most of them files of Departments, which are quite different kinds of records from manuscript collections.  They are vital for understanding the political, social, and economic evolution of the Irish State.  Furthermore, the slashing of the National Library of Ireland budget has been disproportionate; its funding has been cut by 40% and its staff by 38% from 2008 to 2012.  Despite this, it has delivered on key aspects of public service reform and innovation.  It hosted 1.2 million visitors last year, has promoted shared services, curated major exhibitions and made vast amounts of material available online.</P>
        <P>This debate is not about money or approaches to the arts.  It is about autonomous governance, public ownership and resisting the bureaucratic centralisation of the arts and cultural administration in Ireland.  If this Government was serious about reform, it would do the opposite by allowing genuine, autonomous and transparent governance of the cultural institutions, with unpaid board members independent of party politics and experts in their fields.  It would, without delay, meet the people who know best &mdash; the various artistic and cultural organisations and stakeholders.  It would value independent advice and input rather than seeking to eliminate it.  More important, it would desist from attempts to micromanage complex institutions with rich histories under the pretence of cost cutting.  I call on the Minister to develop an all-lreland approach to arts and culture and to remember that there are sometimes very rare institutions whose societal value far exceeds any monetary value.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I add my voice and that of Sinn F&eacute;in to endorsing the ongoing positive contribution made by the arts and culture sector to our economy and our society.  Arts and culture should not be seen as an add-on or an afterthought.  Arts and culture is about who we were, who we are and how we see ourselves.  Our culture is not stagnant but is evolving and changing all the time.</P>
        <P>The cultural and creative industries are varied and dynamic.  They include performing arts, visual arts, heritage, film, television, radio, books, photography, dance and music.  The sector has made a massive contribution to our economy.  In Ireland, it created 79,000 jobs and contributed &euro;4.7 billion to our economy in 2011.  On an EU-wide level, the cultural and creative industry represents 2.7% of Europe&rsquo;s GDP, which is higher than the real estate, food, beverages and tobacco industries.  In Dublin, the Temple Bar Cultural Trust continues to put culture and arts at the centre of the capital&rsquo;s economy.  Temple Bar supports 400 businesses and had a turnover of &euro;676 million in 2009.  One of its most successful projects was Culture Night, an experiment in opening up cultural venues to the public in Dublin.  This was a collaborative effort involving the art galleries and theatres staying open late into the night and street performers replacing traffic on the streets.  It was so successful that it is now an annual event in Dublin and has become an all-Ireland initiative, with culture nights taking place in Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Belfast, Derry, Letterkenny, Drogheda, Gaelteacht areas, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Offaly, Tipperary, Sligo, Strabane, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow and Sligo.</P>
        <P>Arts and culture also has a very important role in rebuilding people&rsquo;s lives and in tackling the consequences of Dublin&rsquo;s drug crisis.  RADE is an innovative and imaginative community-based drug rehabilitation project in Dublin&rsquo;s south inner city.  Some 21 participants are involved in the programmes of art, drama, creative writing, film and relapse prevention.  The programmes involve some of Ireland&rsquo;s leading contemporary artists across all art forms.  Artists work closely with participants, guiding them through the processes of awareness, creativity and discovery that are at the core of the arts and expression.  RADE&rsquo;s mission is to engage drug users within the arts and therapeutic supports and provide a platform for their artistic expression.  To date it has produced films, plays for radio and theatre and art exhibitions.</P>
        <P>In the heartland of my constituency, there is the Tallaght Theatre Group, the Rua Red cultural centre, the civic centre, Tallaght Alternative Arts and Entertainment, music and dance groups and a wide range of community-based activity.  Our next goal in the Tallaght area is a ceathr&uacute; Gaeltacht.  This is part of the development plan of South Dublin County Council.  Hopefully, we can see it developing with cross-party support.  It feeds into the n&iacute;onra and the meanscoil in that area.</P>
        <P>With the current downturn in the economy, it is too easy to use the recession as an excuse to simply cut back on funding to this sector.  This is lazy and simplistic and must be resisted.  The arts and cultural sector must be seen as a sector that requires co-ordination and investment.  The Government must ensure proper and adequate funding is invested in our domestic cultural industry.  It requires making our case to the EU.  The seventh EU framework programme has &euro;9 billion remaining out a total &euro;50 billion while Horizon 2020 has &euro;79 billion.  The EU 2020 Creative Europe fund has &euro;1.8 billion.  There is also funding to strengthen the role of local and regional development, including the EU 2020 common strategic framework fund of &euro;376 billion.  Money is available.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a high level working group, possibly chaired by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaelteacht Affairs.  The working group must bring together agencies managing EU programmes in Ireland and adopt a thematic approach on culture and creative industries.  It should link in with practitioners and organisations in communities.  It should develop interdepartmental partnerships and strengthen cross-Border links.  It is time we saw the cultural creative industries as a means to create jobs, build communities and improve our quality of life but this will only happen with the right attitude and proper co-ordination.  Responsibility for this lies with the Minster for Arts, Heritage and the Gaelteacht.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>We are heading into a decade of centenary celebrations.  I am a member of the committee chaired by the Minister.  Another anniversary must be remembered within the next few days, the destruction of the public records office in the Four Courts in early July 90 years ago.  It was the greatest cultural catastrophe that befell the State.  Documents stretching back 700 years were destroyed, including the last of the remaining census records.  Some were pulped during the First World War because of the shortage of paper.  It shows the lack of value placed on our cultural heritage.</P>
        <P>Some 90 years later, instead of looking forward to the ten years of centenary celebrations and the vision and opportunity presented to us, we are having a debate about pennypinching.  Money cannot be saved because people know about the chronic lack of space in the National Archives of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland when we try to catalogue or display items.  The dedicated staff in both institutions cover for much of the failure of the State.  I have been there on numerous occasions to use the embarrassing clapped-out microfilm machines.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the investment that was made in this area, but the reality is that whatever investment was done was not nearly enough.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We are talking about very small savings here, and the question that must be asked is what we will ultimately end up with.  The arm&rsquo;s length and independent status of these institutions is a positive aspect which allows each of them to contribute.  Yet there does not seem to have been any serious consultation, including public consultation, on what is now proposed to be done.  There is a real danger that we may end up destroying institutions that have been of fantastic value to our society, despite the underfunding they suffered over the years.  Part of the reason I did not sign the motion is to do with the very important fact, as I have said, that money should have been invested during the good years.  It is only when one visits facilities such as the new public records office in Northern Ireland that one sees the type of investment that was made elsewhere and the return on that investment, even if one is only looking at it from the point of view of cultural tourism.</P>
        <P>There is much reference these days to that generic term &ldquo;shovel-ready projects&rdquo;.  If we are to encourage people to come here to do research and so on, then we must, in this year of The Gathering, look to the mothership notion to which David McWilliams has referred.  In other words, we must have facilities that are properly resourced and properly functioning.  The reality, however, is that we are not even thinking in that direction at this stage.  None of us needs to be reminded that the country is in an extremely difficult economic position.  However, there are areas in which we must spend money.  The area we are discussing today is as worthy of investment as are capital projects such as railways and roads and it too offers a return on investment.  As I said, we are facing into ten years of celebrations and commemorations, culminating in 2022.  The great irony is that one of the events we will commemorate in that year will be the 100th anniversary of the terrible destruction of our public records office in the Four Courts, an unforgivable catastrophe for this State.</P>
        <P>We must adopt a much broader vision which seeks to value that which is important, such as the independence and arms-length design of our cultural institutions.  Incidentally, these institutions were inherited; we did not create them.  The very least we should demand of ourselves is that we not do them any harm.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I hope the Acting Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes, will give me some latitude and not be too hard on me.  He and I, together with our Tipperary colleagues, are now serving a united constituency and must all stick together.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, indicated that the primary purpose of this Bill is to close a loophole in current law.  The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 provides for an offence of withholding information in regard to serious offences but specifically excludes sexual offences.  This Bill will ensure there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of any serious offence, including sexual offences, against children and vulnerable adults to inform the Garda of same.  The Minister went on to say that recent banking and child abuse scandals have shown that some individuals and organisations knew or believed that crimes were being committed but did not alert the authorities to that effect.  I am somewhat uneasy in referring to the banking scandal and child sex offences in the same sentence.  I agree, however, that in both instances, the problem was that people in positions of authority did not speak up.  In the case of the banking situation, the Financial Regulator and others, including Members of this House, should have exercised greater oversight.  In the case of sexual offences against children and vulnerable adults, a variety of persons in authority were unable, unwilling or did not see the necessity of reporting these heinous crimes.</P>
        <P>It is important that we take action to prevent any recurrence of such failures in the future.  In some cases, action was not taken because of a fear of the consequences if suspicions were unfounded or because individuals were under no legal obligation to inform.  Every citizen of this State could use that excuse in many areas.  I have been involved in Muintir na T&iacute;re and Community Alert since 1985 and have often found there is great reluctance among people to be an &ldquo;informer&rdquo;.  This is a legacy of attitudes that were widespread during the struggle for independence and beyond, when it was seriously frowned upon to supply any information to the peelers, the RIC or the RUC.  We must leave those fears and ideologies to history by encouraging and supporting right-thinking people to do the right thing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which works with Muintir na T&iacute;re in operating the Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch schemes in communities throughout the State, must be more proactive in offering that type of support and in becoming more socially integrated within the communities it serves.  It is a retrograde step to close rural Garda stations and withdraw vehicles and other resources.  What is good in one part of society is good in others.</P>
        <P>The Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 provides safeguards for persons who report suspected child abuse in good faith.  However, a similar protection does not currently extend to people reporting alleged abuse of vulnerable adults, which is a dreadful legislative anomaly at this point in our history.  I heard snippets of the annual document published today by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, which shows that whistleblowers in the Health Service Executive and elsewhere had to go to her office seeking redress after being punished and victimised for reporting wrongdoing.  That is very regrettable.</P>
        <P>It is important that we engage fully with this important discussion.  Last year the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality examined the heads of this Bill and invited submissions thereon.  Nine submissions were received and a public hearing took place on 30 November 2011 to examine the main points raised in further detail.  That meeting was attended by representatives of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, One in Four, the CARI Foundation and one individual.  A report was subsequently published by the committee, which I will deal with presently.</P>
        <P>This is a shortcoming of the House.  We are elected as legislators and would all like to profess that we know what is going on locally.  We had arguments in committee earlier today concerning this matter.  I believe that a public consultation was supposed to be held but it was hamfisted and shambolic.  In light of this, I must put my hands up and say that I was not aware that this consultation was taking place.  How can we make an effort when we have such an important consultation as the one on this legislation?  How was it advertised or otherwise disseminated to the public, to groups or more importantly, to individuals?  The latter may have been victims of abuse when they were children, whether in homes or in the family.</P>
        <P>There are interesting figures provided as an addendum to this report about where such abuse takes place.  It is not all confined to State or church bodies, as the media would often lead us to believe.  The recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, which has now deteriorated into a total farce, would lead us to believe that this all happened behind the doors of convents or religious brothers.</P>
        <P>While I am not condoning one act of child abuse, I am condemning those who place all the blame on the church, perhaps for some other reasons.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s address to this House after the Cloyne report, may also have gone a little over the top.  We have to be very careful in what we say here because we do not want to have more injustice perpetrated on people who gave good service to this State &mdash; namely the religious brothers and sisters and other reverend people North and South.</P>
        <P>Last week, honest people from all over this country, including Northern Ireland, came in to meet us.  They were not members of any group or organisation. They had resigned from those organisations because they felt it had all become about compensation.  They felt some of those organisations had been hijacked, so they left.  They came in here to address us openly last week.</P>
        <P>I was at Cahir to visit them.  They do not want money and have refused to accept it but they want their lives and dignity.  In addition, they want their minds to be at peace.  They also want to know that we are going to change things for the better.  They want to know that if they have children or grandchildren in that situation it will not be allowed to happen.  They are fighting the good fight and carrying the torch to put it all in the past and leave it behind us, moving forward into a new, modern Ireland where such things cannot happen.</P>
        <P>During the Oireachtas sub-committee hearings, it became apparent that drafting legislation in this area would be extremely complex and difficult.  We know it is and why would it not be?  In the course of the public hearings it was noted that there had been much comment on institutional abuse, to which I have referred.  However, the sub-committee was informed that much abuse was <i>inter familia</i>.  The legislation needs to strike a balance between confidentiality and the current risk to children and vulnerable adults.  The submissions gave examples of child abuse.  It appears that during the debates in 1996 it was expected that some form of mandatory reporting of child abuse would be put on a statutory footing in the near future.  The Children First guidelines will be put on a statutory footing this year, but after a lapse of 16 years.</P>
        <P>The Bill also introduces mandatory reporting.  Section 9 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 places a duty on all persons, rather than a particular specialised group, to report knowledge or suspicions of serious crime.  As I said earlier, that is incumbent on all of us at all times wherever we may be.  The legislation was introduced following the Omagh bombing and aimed to combat terrorism.  However, it criminalised the withholding of information on serious offences, and not just terrorism offences.  A serious offence covers serious crime but excludes sexual crimes.  The need for section 9 along with a number of other sections in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is revised annually by the Oireachtas.  As recently as last week, I spoke on the Bill and voted for it.  Unfortunately, despite the 1998 ceasefire, we still have a threat from the Real IRA and other groups like that, including some loyalist terrorists as well.</P>
        <P>The use of the Offences Against State Act was not used as commonly as we were led to believe.  Up to June 2011, 63 people had been charged under the Act; 117 up to June 2010; 137 up to May 2009; and 115 up to June 2008.  There was a wide degree of variance, but it was not over used, although that was the worry when the legislation was introduced.</P>
        <P>In publishing this Bill, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated that the Cloyne and Ryan reports clearly demonstrated the need to strengthen our law in regard to the disclosure of information concerning offences against children.  It is not acceptable that there can be a cloak of secrecy surrounding such offences or offences against other vulnerable persons.  The term &ldquo;other vulnerable persons&rdquo; is wide-ranging and it is important for us to understand all the nuances of human frailties and how people can become vulnerable.  It is not only by sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>While much of the media attention concerning child abuse focused on abuse by the clergy, it is important to note that national statistics from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland show that almost 80% &mdash; a startling figure &mdash; of childhood sexual abuse victims were abused by someone known to them, such as immediate family members, relatives or family friends.  Some 12% were abused by those in authority, that is, teachers, sports coaches or priests.  Some 3% were abused by strangers and 5% by others.  Therefore 12% were abused by those in authority, although 0.01% would be too much.</P>
        <P>We need to get back to basics and reality, however, and so do the media.  We must understand that we cannot tar everyone with the same brush, including those great institutions and bastions of power that controlled so much in Ireland.  We now have the Minister for Education and Skills trying to take the Catholic Church out of education altogether, but the education system would be a far poorer place without it.  We must never forget the work done by the Roman Catholic Church.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, appreciates that, but we cannot have these side-swipes and below-the-belt attacks to try to banish all these people.  I am tired of saying that I have worked with reverend sisters and other religious in providing the Ashling Centre and now also with a drug misuse centre in my own county.  They are visionary and well educated, as well as knowing what they want to do and how to get there.  They are outstanding motivators because they do not have the distractions of family life.  Those figures are worth reflecting on and we cannot say often enough that people should acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>It is no harm to correct or abolish old, outdated language in legislation.  I am concerned, however, about some of the proposed sentences in the Bill.  I believe that sentences should be very strong, in addition to having support for whistle-blowers.  There should be no hiding place for anyone who abuses children or vulnerable adults.  I am concerned about the proposed term of five years&rsquo; imprisonment because I do not believe enough rehabilitation takes place there.</P>
        <P>There is a pilot project in Nenagh which operates a restorative justice programme.  The justice system is not worth its salt if it does not involve restorative justice to try to correct offenders and make them better people.  They should obviously have remorse for what they have done.  When anyone is convicted of an offence, the remorse will always stay with them.  After serving their sentences, however, they are free people again.  Nonetheless, it is important that they emerge from detention as better people, able to live life to the full and enhance their communities in so doing.</P>
        <P>A couple of weeks ago during the leaving certificate examinations, I saw the difficulties and pressures facing students, including those arising as a result of modern technology.  During the last D&aacute;il, several companies attended committees and tried to sell us ways of restricting access to certain websites for those under 18 years of age.   I am as guilty as anyone in terms of allowing my eight children access to all types of facilities.  We did not have those types of distractions or pressures.  I sat my examinations in 1976, from which I was probably collected by my parents or got the bus or cycled home.  If I did not do well in an examination nobody except, perhaps, one or two other students knew that.  I probably told my parents when I got home.  However, now when a student does not do well in an examination, every student in the school knows about it, as do students in the neighbouring schools, following which the student goes into &ldquo;meltdown&rdquo;.  While I know that these devices are not permitted in the examination halls, once finished their examinations the students are on them texting and on Facebook.  There is a great deal of cyber bullying going on and we need to address it.  It is an offence against young and old, in particular young people.  Many elderly people are also abused by way of mobile phone.  It is fortunate perhaps that many people over 60 or 70 years of age do not have a mobile phone.  Many of them do not even have a landline.  Perhaps, they are better off not having one.  They will probably have a better quality of life as a result.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman would indicate how much time I have remaining.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>The revision of the constituency has nothing to do this.  The Deputy is as concerned about that as I am.</P>
        <P>I am interested in restorative justice.  The Bill lists at Schedule 1 the specific offences which must be reported, in particular offences against children and vulnerable persons.  I believe in restorative justice.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular in South Tipperary.  We have all read in the media of heinous crimes, the victims of which, despite their trauma and having gone through the ordeal of a court case because the perpetrator refused to admit guilt resulting in their having to give evidence, have in their impact statements praised a particular garda or sergeant for their assistance.  This type of contact is important.  For this reason, I believe the restorative justice system should be enhanced and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have further involvement in this regard.  As I stated, we must ensure people have confidence in the law and in the justice system.  The justice system can be very intimidating for people who have not previously engaged with it.  We could perhaps use the secondary school system to educate people about the system, including jury service, which, too, is an intimidating process.  A recently deceased 99 year old &mdash; whom Deputy Hayes and I knew &mdash; was called for jury service two weeks ago despite that she died six months ago.  I am not sure whose fault it is that her name had not been removed from the register.  We must ensure we have in place a system which ensures pensioners, in particular of that age, are not summoned to jury service.</P>
        <P>There must also be some understanding of modern day culture.  I have been calling for many years for refresher courses for the Judiciary.  Currently, once one is a judge, one is a judge for life.  However, life evolves and changes.  Some judges live in ivory towers far away from the reality of daily life.  There is a need for change in this area.  Many Members attended the recent meeting with Ms Trudi Lalor on the need to make the Coroner&rsquo;s Court system more sensitive.  The courts system is adversarial.  We know that.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who, following much pressure from this side of the House, has dropped &mdash; I hope he has &mdash; the provision which provided that people would have to go to court if a second inspection of a septic tank failed and they wanted to appeal the matter.  The courts have enough to do in terms of dealing with criminals.  We should not be making criminals of ordinary people who are trying to provide homes for their families.</P>
        <P>As I stated earlier, cyber bullying is a serious issue.  It is unseen and can happen at 5 a.m.  While previously a student may have been subjected to bullying during school time they can now be bullied at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. while they should be asleep, which is worrying.  I agree with much of what is contained in this Bill.  This Bill makes an important amendment to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 in regard to offences against vulnerable persons, which are as wrong as any terrorist act.  These are acts of terror perpetrated on one person.  It is important to note that only 12% of abuse &mdash; which is 12% too much &mdash; happened behind the walls of institutions or in cars with clergymen.  It is important we focus on and understand that and that the public is made aware that this may also be happening in the workplace, homes, neighbours homes and so on.  I compliment those who, before it became fashionable, became foster parents, taking in vulnerable, damaged and hurt children and young adults whom they cared for, nourished and listened to, giving them the confidence to move on and live meaningful lives.</P>
        <P>As regards submissions, only three groups and one individual attended the committee hearings.  There are so many victims of abuse.  The people with whom we met last week in the AV room were not aware of the redress system.  There are people today in America, Australia, the UK and so on who were victims of abuse here.  We heard many stories in regard to abuse of children in homes and institutions.  In the past, many children were sent to farms and pubs to work, where dreadful abuse was perpetrated on them.  There are many areas in respect of which the State has failed.  However, I do not lay blame at anyone&rsquo;s door.  We must be more aware of what is going on around us &mdash; which brings me back again to the community alert programmes &mdash; and not only the criminal who might kick in our door and threaten to shoot us.  A criminal held four people hostage for two hours today during a raid on a pharmacy in Cashel town.  Thankfully, nobody was hurt and that the garda&iacute; were able to deal with that situation, which was a frightening ordeal.  However, that is what is going on everywhere.</P>
        <P>As mentioned, there are people who will try to find a loophole in this Bill because they do not want to report.  I will not go into the area of confessionals and what happens in that regard.  I believe in confession and in the sacrament of penance and reconciliation.  I will leave the issue of the clergy not being allowed to report on what is told in the confessional to wiser counsel.  However, we must be wary of that.  The people who have taken those vows will have to deal with that themselves in their institutions.  It is a sensitive and difficult issue as is the issue for which we are legislating in this Bill.  We must ensure we remain alert to this and that we spread awareness about it.</P>
        <P>It is wrong that the committee received only four submissions on this hugely important issue.  All of our committees are failing to engage the public.  Perhaps this House is failing to engage the public and that is the reason we do not have the interaction and uptake of votes.  My colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, is the Acting Chairman so I will not go into the promises of the last election.  I am just saying there is a disconnect.  While the committee holding the hearings &mdash; I do not know who is the Chairman &mdash; did a good job the response it got was pretty pathetic given the number of crimes committed over the years.  A number of people abroad have not heard about the redress board and the various schemes.  I referred in this House two weeks ago to the abuse victims organisation being hijacked by individuals, including by an individual in my county.  The individual to whom I referred is a former mayor.  I and the people of Clonmel in Tipperary are confused.  The same person praised the institution at every turn for decades and gave the people involved civic receptions.  There was then, however, a metamorphosis and he turned around and attacked the people he had defended.  He also attacked the newspapers for printing what was public knowledge and in the public domain after court cases.  When euro appeared, he did the exact opposite of what he had been doing.  This is despicable.  The people I met last week despise this more than anything else.  They want money and justice and their minds back.  This is a hard thing for them to say.  They want to get back their minds and their living spirit, which had been so traumatised and suppressed over the years.</P>
        <P>It behoves us all to learn serious lessons from these instances.  We should notice and be aware of any offences against a person, young or old, and report them.  We should be community aware and we should be involved in neighbourhood watch.  Above all, however, we should be alert about human beings.  If we do this, we will have a better society as result.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance.  I look forward to further discussion on the Bill.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if, in seeking to achieve the objectives laid out in Strategic Goals 1 and 3 of the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020, he will be sending an application to the European Union for State aid approval in respect of a REFIT support mechanism for offshore wind, wave or tidal power; if not, his views on whether the absence of such a scheme significantly undermines Ireland&rsquo;s ability to reach the 2020 target of 40% for domestic renewable energy generation; his views on whether the absence of such a scheme places Ireland at a competitive disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions which are seeking investment in their domestic renewable sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30740/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Keeping the cost of energy in Ireland as low as possible is important for domestic consumers and plays a critical role in maintaining our overall economic competiveness.  Late last year the Government agreed with my decision on cost grounds not to proceed with an application to the European Commission for State Aid clearance for a higher priced feed in tariff to support Offshore Wind development in the Irish electricity market.</P>
        <P>While offshore wind is already being deployed in several Member States as part of delivering on their national renewable energy targets, it is still a very expensive technology to deploy, typically costing double the price of deploying onshore wind.  Offshore wind currently costs in the region of &euro;3 million per megawatt to deploy compared to the cost of onshore wind which is around &euro;1.5 million per megawatt.</P>
        <P>Given the higher costs which would be incurred by business and domestic electricity consumers to support such a tariff, I believe that we could better focus instead on the opportunity to develop a renewable electricity export market for the offshore wind sector.  The economic case for developing Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind resources lies in gaining access to bigger electricity markets and in developing inter Member State renewable electricity trading.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s deployment of renewable energy sources in electricity has been increasing steadily in recent years as we work North and South, to deliver a 40% level of renewable electricity consumption by 2020.  There has been good progress from 5% renewable electricity in 2005 to around 17% renewable electricity at present.  The challenge is to steadily increase renewable electricity generation in the all island market from onshore wind and biomass year on year towards 2020.</P>
        <P>I am confident that Ireland has the capability to achieve its targets for domestic renewable electricity from the onshore wind projects already in the existing Gate processes despite some of the planning and financing challenges being encountered by some projects.</P>
        <P>Wave and tidal energy is still very much at the research and development stage and the commercial and technical feasibility is not yet proven and while there are very promising wave technology devices in development they are very much at pre-commercial stages.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a relatively small electricity market, with around 2 million electricity consumers.  The Public Service Obligation levy which is paid by all electricity customers in this small market currently encompasses support for peat, some conventional generation as well as renewable generation.  It makes economic sense that we focus on developing our lower cost renewable resources to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s binding EU targets for renewable electricity.  In parallel we will actively pursue the potential opportunities for renewable energy export, which offshore wind represents.</P>
        <P>I met UK energy Minister Hendry in London last week and we have set in place a formal process to work towards finalising by the end of the year a Memorandum of Understanding that will facilitate renewable electricity trading.  My Department will also continue to work with the UK energy Department through the ongoing work of the British-Irish Council and in the EU through the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative to deal with the market, regulatory and technical issues that need to be addressed to enable us to deliver on the high renewable energy resources we have.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>In March of this year Shell E &amp; P Ireland Ltd applied to my Department for permission to acquire 3D seismic data over the Corrib Field.  The survey, which commenced on 17 June, 2012 is being undertaken to supplement the 3D seismic data previously acquired on the Corrib Field in 1997.  The primary objective of the survey is to improve the imaging over the Corrib Field.</P>
        <P>The type of survey being undertaken involves Ocean Bottom Cables on the seabed laid by a cable laying vessel and a second vessel equipped with air guns, for the deployment and operation of the seismic sources.</P>
        <P>A seismic air gun unit is basically a large piston with a plunger that discharges a compressed air bubble into the water at considerable pressure thereby creating a sound source.  This sound is comparable in magnitude to many naturally occurring and other man-made sounds.  The specific characteristics of seismic sounds and the operational procedures employed during seismic survey are such that resulting risks to marine mammals are generally expected to be very low.  Nevertheless, the assessment of any potential impacts is undertaken by my Department, and mitigation measures are implemented to further reduce the risk of harm to marine mammals.</P>
        <P>When assessing seismic survey applications, my Department consults with a number of other bodies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).</P>
        <P>On 20 April of this year, my Department conveyed approval for the carrying out of the requested survey, subject to a number of conditions, including that all operations should be conducted in compliance with the NPWS&rsquo;s Code of Practice for the Protection of Marine Mammals during Acoustic Seafloor Surveys in Irish Waters.  The approval also required that a Fisheries Liaison Officer and a Marine Mammal Observer would be on board the vessel for the duration of the survey.</P>
        <P>The conditions that apply to this survey are consistent with the conditions that apply to other such surveys in the Irish offshore.</P>

        <P>I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, including petrol and diesel fuel prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.</P>
        <P>Energy policy objectives for Ireland and the European Union are delivering security of supply and reducing the impact of energy costs for consumers and business, through the development of renewable energy resources, enhanced energy efficiency and greater competition.  National and EU energy policy objectives are also informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes including the Biofuels Obligation are aimed at moving Ireland&rsquo;s economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility.</P>
        <P>In the specific use of fuel, the Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that Ireland imports 100% of its fuel requirements mainly in the form of refined oil product. The main factor governing the price of fuel is the global price for oil and Ireland has no control over this cost.</P>
        <P>Previous surveys have shown that prices, which Irish retailers charge for oil products, relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil but it is, of course, ultimately subject to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.  Prices at the pump, therefore, reflect global market price, which is volatile, transportation costs, euro/dollar exchange rate fluctuations and other operating costs as well as the impact of taxes on oil products.  As the Deputy will appreciate the issue of taxation of fuel prices is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>A key priority under the ocean energy strategy is to increase the research and design capabilities in ocean energy in Ireland. Wave and tidal technology is still at the RD&amp;D stage globally and is not yet a commercially viable technology.</P>
        <P>The Ocean Energy Development Unit was established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2008 to take forward the Ocean Energy Programme.  The SEAI and the Marine Institute established an Ocean Energy Test Site for quarter scale prototypes of wave energy devices in Galway Bay.  Two companies have tested at the site to date.  The site is also being used in conjunction with the Smart Bay project being taken forward by the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>The wave-tank facility at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) University College Cork, is Ireland&rsquo;s centre of excellence in ocean energy research, modelling and technical support for early stage device developers.</P>
        <P>The SEAI has provided support for the enhancement of the wave research capabilities at HMRC through upgrading of the existing wave tank test facility at HMRC prior to its becoming the National Ocean Test Facility (NOTF), as a key strategic component of the Irish Maritime and Energy Research Cluster (IMERC) in Ringaskiddy, Cork.</P>
        <P>The Prototype Development Fund administered by the SEAI supports the development of wave and tidal device prototypes and associated supporting technologies.  A total of 33 projects have received funding.  Of these, 21 projects have been completed and 11 are in the process of completion.</P>
        <P>Work is also continuing on the pre-planning stages for the potential development of a grid connected pre-commercial full scale prototype test site off County Mayo.</P>
        <P>The development bodies under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are also involved in developing and assisting the ocean energy sector as part of their clean technology development drive.  Ocean Energy has been identified as a priority in the research prioritisation exercise.</P>
        <P>My Department is finalising an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, which is underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment and Natura Impact Assessment of Irish waters that was commissioned by the SEAI.</P>

        <P>My Department must operate within the multi-annual Employment Control Framework (ECF) as agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ECF places annual limits on the number of full time equivalent staff which may be employed within the Department.</P>
        <P>Currently the Department has some headroom as between the existing complement and the ECF and the ECF limit.  It is, therefore, proposed to appoint some additional staff, within the ECF limit, between now and year end.</P>
        <P>In specific terms, my Department will shortly appoint two economists and is in the process of filling three senior technical positions in the Natural Resources Division of the Department.  The estimated salary cost of filling these vacancies is &euro;370,000 per annum and this will be met in 2012 from the approved Vote allocation for the Department.</P>
        <P>Any decision to fill additional positions will be considered in the context of the Workforce Planning exercise which is expected to be completed shortly and continued adherence to the provisions of the Employment Control Framework.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 125 together. </P>
        <P>The Programme for Government states that a feed-in tariff will be provided for micro-generators wishing to produce electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and that they will be facilitated to sell surplus electricity to the grid, while the tariff should not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) estimates that the single electricity market price will be &euro;64 per megawatt hour in the coming year.  A micro-generation support scheme offered by ESB to domestic customers under specified conditions between February 2009 and February 2012, consisting of a combined tariff of &euro;190 per megawatt hour (almost three times the estimated single electricity market price for the coming year) had fewer than 500 subscribers over a three year period.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are finalising analysis, which will be submitted to me shortly, on the most cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the micro-generation sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers.</P>
        <P>Any increased electricity costs arising from extending such a scheme to PSO supports, such as via a feed-in-tariff, would have to be borne by all electricity consumers.</P>
        <P>The National Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  It is also in line with EU requirements where Member States are obliged to progress smart metering.</P>
        <P>Development and implementation of the national smart metering programme, entrusted to the CER, is progressing to schedule. Phase 1 of the programme, consisting of Technology Trials, Customer Behaviour Trials and a Cost Benefit Analysis for both electricity and gas smart metering have been completed and have proved positive.  The CER have published the findings of these detailed studies and they are available on the CER&rsquo;s Website.  A CER decision on progress to Phase 2 of the project is expected shortly.</P>

        <P>The Government has decided that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s (BG&Eacute;) Energy business will be included as part of the assets disposal programme.  BG&Eacute; is a strong and dynamic State company.  The success of Bord G&aacute;is Energy demonstrates BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s capacity to develop new and efficient businesses for the benefit of Irish consumers as well as the State as shareholder.</P>
        <P>The Government is irrevocably committed to retaining the Bord G&aacute;is transmission and distribution networks as well as the gas interconnectors in State ownership as national strategic infrastructure and fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply and the economy.</P>
        <P>Following the Government&rsquo;s decision on the State asset disposal programme, a group including my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA has been tasked with progressing all policy, regulatory, legislative and financial issues to be addressed prior to the disposal of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.</P>
        <P>The group is making good progress; the identification of these issues is complete and the group is currently developing an implementation programme to address these issues in order to facilitate a transaction process for Bord G&aacute;is Energy commencing in 2013.</P>
        <P>Turning to Irish Water; the recent decision to establish Irish Water within the BG&Eacute; Group reflects the Government&rsquo;s confidence in BG&Eacute;.

        <P>Currently approximately 1900MW of renewable generation is connected to the grid including over 1600MW of wind generation, small and large hydro generation and some small amounts of biomass generation including landfill gas.</P>
        <P>In order to connect to the electricity grid, generators require a grid connection offer. Supervision of the grid connection process, including access to offers, is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The Gate process was put in place by the CER following public consultation.  It is a group processing approach (GPA) towards the processing and issuance of grid connection offers to renewable generators.</P>
        <P>To date there have been 3 Gates.  Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted.  Under Gate 3, 3900MW of offers have issued to renewable generators. In addition to the 1900MW of renewable generation already connected to the grid, 1500MW of renewable generation has already contracted for grid connection build with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.  For the most part, these are projects from Gate 1 and Gate 2 that are still awaiting grid build-out, along with about 500MW from Gate 3.</P>
        <P>The latest forecasts from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is 4000MW, provided we achieve our energy efficiency goals.  The take up of Gate 3 offers cannot be quantified as yet.  A small number of those in Gate 3 have accepted their offers to date and have already contracted with EirGrid or ESB Networks.  Others in Gate 3 have not yet made a decision on whether they are accepting their offer or not, pending the issuing of constraint reports by EirGrid.  EirGrid is currently working on producing these constraint reports which are subject to Single Electricity Market (SEM) decisions and once issued those in Gate 3 applicants will have a short period of time within which to accept or reject their offer and to pay their deposit.</P>
        <P>It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2 and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3 is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.  Details regarding number and type of renewable energy projects awaiting planning permission are available from the relevant planning authority. In order to be accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff scheme (REFIT), administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, applicants must have both a grid connection offer and planning permission.</P>

Also, it should be noted that the Press Council model has been highlighted at the Leveson Inquiry as a potential model for the UK to follow.  Whilst it is only when this Inquiry has formally reported that there will be any formal recommendations to consider, it is also worth noting that we have a very different culture in print media in Ireland, and there is no evidence to suggest that the same abuses took place here.  I know the Press Council will carefully evaluate the outcome of the Leveson Inquiry, and the Government will be happy to engage with them at the appropriate time on any suggestions they may have around improving the systems of governance in this critical area.</P>

        <P>The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended. ComReg is independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function.</P>
        <P>In accordance with its statutory functions, ComReg has consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands.</P>
        <P>I am advised that ComReg received considerable interest in this consultation process which has resulted in the decision document for the award of a number of individual rights of use in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz radio spectrum bands (ComReg Document 12/25 and Decision 04/12 published on 16 March 2012).  ComReg&rsquo;s Information Memorandum for this award process details the processes and procedures ComReg is employing to implement its substantive decisions (ComReg Document 12/52 published on 25 May 2012).</P>
        <P>The reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its decisions on the minimum coverage and roll-out requirements are set out in section 5.5 of Document 12/25.  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed the 70% population obligation by a considerable margin given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  It should be noted that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their current respective licences. For example, for 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as 3, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is more than its obligation.</P>
        <P>ComReg also notes that coverage continues to be an important competitive differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market.  Any deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.</P>
        <P>The importance of maintaining the existing levels of mobile telephony and mobile broadband coverage has been raised with ComReg by my officials.  While the outcome of the forthcoming multi-band spectrum release process can not be anticipated, I understand that ComReg is not expecting any reduction in coverage as a result of the process. It is also important to note that ComReg&rsquo;s coverage proposals are designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a manner that would ensure that cherry picking of high-density urban areas would not occur.</P>

        <P>Last week,  building on the June 2011 British Irish Council agreement on developing an all islands energy approach, I had the latest in a series of meetings with UK Energy Minister Charles Hendry around the issue of developing renewable electricity trade between the two countries.  Both sides agreed to work towards concluding a Memorandum of Understanding by the end of the year which will be an important step in ensuring that cross border renewable trade can take place.</P>
        <P>Officials from both sides are examining a range of issues around the electricity market, regulatory and technical grid areas to underpin the creation of cross jurisdictional renewable electricity trade. The UK Department of Energy has just concluded a public call for evidence around the issues involved in opening up their market to allow for renewable electricity imports.</P>
        <P>Increased interconnection between the two islands offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and off shore wind  and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.</P>
        <P>The volume of trade that could develop has the potential to become very significant over time.  Ireland has a renewable energy resource that is significantly in advance of our own market scale and the challenge for developers will be to come forward with projects of scale that are economically viable and environmentally acceptable.  There are several large developers already seriously examining projects and some of these proposals also involve developing pumped hydro storage options.</P>
        <P>There are clearly construction jobs while the projects are being built, but if projects of scale can be developed, then there will be an opportunity to capture some of the development value chain in Ireland as well as the job opportunities in the operations and maintenance areas.</P>

        <Quest> the version of the Electoral Register that will be used to select the 66 persons who will be consulted as part of the constitutional convention; if he will consider using the Electoral Register for local elections in order that immigrants or non-Irish nationals might also be included in the focus group; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>As the Constitutional Convention will be considering aspects of the Constitution and may make recommendations that would give rise to referendums, the version of the electoral register that will be used in the selection of the 66 citizen members of the Convention will be that used for referendums.</P>
        <P>A polling company will be engaged to randomly select 66 people entitled to vote in a referendum to be members of the Convention on the basis that the persons selected are representative of the population generally in terms of gender, age, social class and region.  The selection process will be overseen by the Convention&rsquo;s independent Chairperson.</P>
        <P>A number of views were expressed that interest groups or specific sections of society should be represented at the Convention.  Examples included vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised groups, children, persons from Northern Ireland (including especially Northern unionists), the Diaspora and Ireland&rsquo;s newest citizens.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly of the view that the Convention should be composed of ordinary citizens and elected representatives. It is not practical to accommodate as members, in a fair and representative manner, all of the groups or sections of society that have been proposed.</P>
        <P>However, it is anticipated that interest groups will be able to interact with the Convention, including by making submissions, and that the Chairperson and members of the Convention would be anxious to hear from a representative spectrum of opinion in carrying out their work.</P>

        <P>The International Finance Corporation (IFC), is a member of the World Bank Group, and is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries.

        <P>Ireland has been a member of the IFC since 1958. We partner with the IFC in providing technical assistance and advisory services to the private sector in developing countries with the aim of reducing poverty through inclusive private sector growth.</P>

        <P LI="1">In 2008 the IFC launched the Conflict-Affected States in Africa (CASA) Initiative to encourage the development of private enterprise in these countries. The CASA   Initiative takes into account the particular obstacles faced by the private sector in fragile and post-conflict countries.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The CASA Initiative focuses on:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Improving the business environment through regulatory reform.</P>

        <P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme, administered from within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by Irish Aid, is sharply focused on the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries and communities in the world.  It is strongly concentrated in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland has a strong international reputation for the high quality of our development programme which has benefited from the contribution of generations of Irish development workers including volunteers, professionals and missionaries who worked to improve the lives of the world&rsquo;s poorest people.  The Government&rsquo;s aid programme is currently funding the work of about 1,300 development workers, volunteers and missionaries in developing countries.  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps, established by Irish Aid, enables those with specific skills to deploy swiftly in humanitarian crises.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to review the 2006 White Paper on Overseas Development Aid and to establish a civilian volunteer corps.  As part of the White Paper review, public consultations have been held in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Sligo and 160 written submissions have been received.  A number of these submissions have emphasised the importance of volunteer placements which focus on sharing specific skills that met the needs of host communities.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, detailed discussions are now underway with key partners in the NGO sector and relevant UN agencies with a view to developing enhanced proposals to support international volunteering.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>Freedom of religious belief and expression is an issue which is discussed regularly with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral meetings and at European Union level.  At these meetings, the Government re-iterates the great importance Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  Individual cases are raised through the formal framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, which was established in 1995.  Through this process the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  Treatment of Falun Gong practitioners is also raised by the European Union as part of regular political dialogue as well as during specific human rights dialogue with China.</P>
        <P>At the most recent session of the EU-China human rights dialogue on 29 May, the EU again raised the issue of restrictions on Falun Gong practitioners.  At this meeting, the EU also presented the Chinese side with a list of individual cases of concern, including those of several detained Falun Gong practitioners.  We have informed our Embassy in Beijing of the case of Ms Gu Qing-ai and Embassy officials are raising Ms Gu&rsquo;s case with the human rights group that co-ordinates the EU position on these issues with China.  We will continue to monitor developments in this case.</P>

        <P>The welfare of the Irish abroad is a very important priority for the Government.  There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The Government&rsquo;s keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our friends within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved.</P>
        <P>With a view to helping some positive momentum around immigration issues insofar as they relate to Ireland, enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas has been a particular focus of our efforts.  If passed this would make 10,500 E-3 visas available to Irish citizens each year.  During my visit to Washington in February this year, I reviewed progress on E-3 issues during meetings with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and with the Friends of Ireland group in the House of Representatives and with Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns.  I also discussed prospects for progress with the Congressional Delegation led by leader Nancy Pelosi in Dublin in March.</P>
        <P>During his recent visit to Washington, the Taoiseach raised immigration with President Obama and with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and the Friends of Ireland Group.  Earlier this month, I spoke again with Senators Leahy and Brown to reiterate the importance the Government attaches to this issue and our support for their efforts to make progress.  On 15 June, President Obama made an announcement in relation to the specific category of young illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children and measures to exempt them from deportation and to be granted temporary work permits.  It is too early to determine what effect, if any, this will have on the overall immigration debate.</P>
        <P>While I am heartened by the advances that have been made so far towards bi-partisan consensus in the  US Senate towards enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 visas, I am conscious that passing any immigration-related legislation in an election year in the US presents very significant challenges.  Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with all relevant actors, including our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives with a view to ensuring that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.</P>

        <P>The Government remains seriously concerned about the situation in Sudan and South Sudan.  We are working with our EU partners to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issue of humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region.  We will continue to use all available opportunities, within the EU and internationally, to raise these issues.  The situation in Sudan and South Sudan, including the humanitarian crisis in Southern Kordofan, has been discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at their meetings over recent weeks and months.  In January, with Ireland&rsquo;s encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians, and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance.  The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to progress in providing the full range of support that we would like to provide to Sudan, and in the region.  In April, the EU called on the Government of Sudan and the SPLM North to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the ongoing conflict.</P>
        <P>The UN Security Council on 2 May and 17 May adopted Resolutions demanding that both Sudan and South Sudan fulfil their obligations under international law to allow access by humanitarian agencies to civilian populations in need of assistance.  Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided substantial assistance for those affected by the conflict in this region.  Earlier this year, we allocated &euro;2 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.  On 24 May, we announced an allocation of a further &euro;3m in funding.  These funds are being provided to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas affected by conflict and by displacement of populations from the Blue Nile and South Kordofan areas.  We have made available a further &euro;1.22 million to Irish NGOs for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Irish Aid Humanitarian Programme Planning funding scheme.  Ireland&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian assistance to Sudan and South Sudan is saving lives daily.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan, the Blue Nile, and other areas facing critical need across the Horn and Sahel regions of Africa.  Along with our EU partners, we will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>I have already made clear on a number of occasions, including in this House, my own deep concern and that of the Irish Government and people regarding the general human rights situation in Bahrain.  The right of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are fundamental rights in a free society, and must be respected by all governments.  The report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry issued last November documented harrowing accounts of excessive force employed against those engaged in pro-democracy demonstrations in Spring 2011 as well as accounts of mistreatment and torture in custody.  The Commission made a number of recommendations that would ensure better protection for human rights in Bahrain, including a recommendation for independent investigations.  It is clear that effective investigations by an independent and impartial body of all allegations of torture in detention are necessary to ensure accountability, and help re-build trust between the two communities in Bahrain as part of a process of national reconciliation.</P>
        <P>Ireland has urged Bahrain at every opportunity to swiftly implement the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, most recently at Bahrain&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last month. At the same time, Ireland recommended that Bahrain amend any articles of its penal code that can be used to prosecute individuals for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or association, and bring its law in line with international standards established by the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department have also regularly raised my concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain with the Bahraini Ambassador in London.  In addition, the Ambassador in Riyadh has relayed my concerns directly to the Bahraini authorities.  While I acknowledge the initial steps taken by the Bahraini authorities in response to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the legitimate demands of those peacefully seeking reform. The only viable path forward for Bahrain is reconciliation and dialogue.  A way must be found to chart a new and inclusive future for Bahrain and I urge the Bahraini authorities and the opposition to engage genuinely and meaningfully in a national reconciliation process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>Ireland remains deeply concerned at the general human rights situation in Bahrain and has not issued a license for the sale of military goods to Bahrain since the outbreak of unrest in that country.  The decision to transfer or deny the transfer of any military goods or technology is at the national discretion of each exporting State.  I cannot comment on individual exports made by other States to third parties, or on the internal decision making process which authorised those exports.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s position on the need for common international standards for arms exports, which take full account of human rights obligations and international law, is well known to all of our partners.  We will continue to make our position clear in all appropriate fora.  Next month, in New York, my officials will participate fully in a Diplomatic Conference at which, I hope, agreement can be reached on a legally binding and comprehensive Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).</P>
        <P>Ireland has been very active in supporting work towards an ATT, including through co-sponsorship in 2008 of a UN Resolution establishing an Open-Ended Working Group to consider the elements that might be included in an ATT.  We have participated actively in the EU Working Group on the ATT and throughout the Preparatory Committee process for next month&rsquo;s conference.  We will continue to work with EU and other like-minded countries to agree an instrument establishing the highest possible common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons that takes full account of human rights obligations and international law.</P>
        <P>I would add that Ireland is bound by and fully supports an EU Common Position which defines the rules governing the control of exports of military technology and equipment by EU Member States. Under this Common Position, Member States assess all licence applications for military exports against a series of Common Criteria. There are eight separate criteria which take into account the effect that the arms transfer could have on the country of final destination. The Common Position and its implementation are kept under constant review by Member States.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Common Position, I would note that armaments companies in the EU are in compliance with one of the strictest export control regimes in the world.  Ireland would expect all of its EU partners to abide by the Common Position. If it emerges that any EU Member State is knowingly engaged in exporting arms in contravention of the Common Position, the Deputy can be assured that Ireland would raise the matter at the appropriate EU level.</P>

        <P>Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visited Dublin on 18 June, and I met her on her arrival at Dublin Airport.  We then had an exchange of views across a range of issues including the current situation in Burma, bilateral trade and economic relations and the ways in which Ireland might be of assistance to Burma as it progresses towards greater democracy and an open economy.  Burma is in the process of undergoing an important and long-awaited transformation, and we in Ireland have been following this with close attention.</P>
        <P>Ireland stands ready to share its experiences and to assist the process of democratisation in Burma in whatever way we can.  From a development co-operation point of view, Ireland&rsquo;s recent experience in Asia is highly relevant to Burma.  We have regional experience in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as well as in Timor Leste &mdash; including in such key areas and issues as the situation of ethnic minorities, poverty reduction, economic development and conflict resolution, all of which are important to Burma&rsquo;s current transition.</P>
        <P>I also informed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi that we will proceed with formalising our diplomatic relations with Burma on the basis of a non-resident ambassador, a decision she welcomed.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, Irish Aid has provided over &euro;7 million to Burma through NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development work and emergency and recovery responses.  We have also been actively engaged in EU discussions to shape the priorities for European co-operation in development assistance with Burma.  Ireland shares the overall EU approach that possible future areas of co-operation could include poverty reduction, in particular among ethnic minority groups; support for democratic transformation; rule of law; human rights, including the release of all remaining political prisoners, accountability and good governance and support for electoral processes.</P>
        <P>We support the idea of a joint EU assessment mission in June to explore issues around the cease fires with ethnic minorities, and issues relating to ethnic minorities more generally.  As far as trade with, and investment in, Burma are concerned, we share the view of Aung San Suu Kyi, as expressed in her address to the International Labour Organisation at Geneva, that such economic engagement should be responsible, and benefit the people of Burma a whole.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the EU Foreign Affairs Council, in the light of recent developments in Burma, decided in April to lift most of the sanctions imposed under the EU&rsquo;s common position.  This decision will be reviewed in October.  In the meantime, Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to keep all these issues under close review, in consultation with our ambassadors in the region, and at EU working groups.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the situation concerning the two men referred to by the Deputy.  As neither of them is an Irish citizen it is not possible for my Department to offer them consular assistance. The Greek authorities are under no legal obligation to assist our Embassy with any requests made in connection with this investigation, as we have no <i>locus standi </i>  in the matter. However, on hearing of Mr. Marku&rsquo;s predicament, and notwithstanding the fact that he is not a citizen of Ireland, the Embassy of Ireland in Athens made contact with the Greek police in an effort to convey the Irish Government&rsquo;s interest in this case on the basis that he is married to an Irish citizen. It was made clear to our Embassy that the authorities in Crete would not provide them with any information regarding this investigation owing to the fact that no Irish citizen was involved in the case.</P>
        <P>To clarify further, the Embassy has certain rights of communication and contact with Irish citizens in Greece to facilitate the exercise of our consular functions under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963). This Embassy has no such rights for other persons, even if they are related to Irish citizens.</P>

        <P>The submission referred to in the question is a copy of a letter on behalf of the trustees of a pension scheme to a retired scheme member outlining proposed adjustments to his pension on foot of the pension fund levy introduced last year for a period of 4 years.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</P>
        <P>However, the legislation also includes provisions aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&rsquo;s liabilities to that member.  I am not in a position to comment on the specific details of the letter. I would assume that, in coming to any decision in this matter, the trustees of the scheme in question will have examined all options open to them and taken professional advice, as appropriate.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together. </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield, estimated by reference to the income tax year 2012, from imposing a further income levy of 1% on all income that is currently liable to the Universal Social Charge (USC) would be of the order of &euro;760 million.</P>
        <P>If the new 1% levy is confined to incomes in excess of &euro;50,000 the corresponding full year yield would be of the order of &euro;442 million. A breakdown of that yield amount by range of income liable to USC is set out in the following table in ranges of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000 and greater than &euro;100,000, in order to ensure completeness of the application of the proposed levy.</P>
        <P>The estimated yield associated with the different income ranges is based on applying a 1% levy to all the income of income earners in each range, that is, to the income they earn below each income range as well as to the income earned within the specified income range.</P>

        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the criteria relating to the engine size of a vehicle and the relief available for vehicles which qualify under the Disabled Drivers Passenger Scheme have been in place since 1989.  The purpose of the scheme was to provide for ways in which people with a physical disability could become more mobile; it is felt that the present limit of 2000cc is sufficient to allow for an extensive choice of vehicle in that regard.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.  The legislation states that where a person satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that a person is a Disabled Driver who complies with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme, that person shall be entitled to relief in respect of a vehicle which is fitted with an engine whose capacity is not greater than 2,000 c.c.</P>
        <P>The administration of the scheme was reviewed by Revenue during 2011, in line with a review of the overall practices in the Central Repayments Office.  This review was held to ensure that the provisions of Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and SI 353/1994 are being adhered to correctly and to ensure that all applications are dealt with as provided for in the legislation. Revenue met with representatives of The Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland in November 2011 and briefed both organisations in relation to the review.</P>
        <P>An information note was sent to the person (details supplied) on 25th April 2012 outlining the rules in relation to Engine Capacity Details for vehicles admissible under the Disabled Drivers Scheme. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994) (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.</P>

        <P Just="Left">1. Non-euro liabilities are translated into euro at the rates of exchange at 15th June 2012. The net euro amount received by the Exchequer was &euro;49.4 billion after adjustment for below par issuance and deduction of a prepaid margin (Note 2), and also reflect the effect of foreign exchange transactions. Non-euro liabilities have been locked-in, as appropriate, in order to remove exchange rate risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">2. A prepaid margin of &euro;0.53 billion was deducted from the loan of &euro;4.19 billion drawdown on 1 February 2011 giving a net liability of &euro;3.67 billion. This margin prepayment will be refunded to Ireland in 2016. The total liability of &euro;50.46 billion included in the National Debt (&euro;130.1 billion at 15th  June 2012) takes account of this reduction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">3. Short Term EFSF Funding of &euro;1.48 billion maturing in 2012 is due to be replaced by longer term funding at a floating interest rate. The EFSF loan of &euro;1.27bn maturing in 2015 is also subject to rollover at a floating rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">4. The EFSF funding provided to Ireland under pooled issuance comes from a variety of fundings, and the EFSF will confirm the interest rate cost related to each loan coming from the pool on every interest payment date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">5. The Interest rates on the UK bilateral loans are subject to a reduction pending the signing of an amendment to the  legal agreement. The reduction is estimated, at this stage, to be about 1.5%. Rate shown is an annualised rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">6. The current rate on the Denmark bilateral loan is 1.787%. This rate resets every 3 months and is due to do so on 29th June 2012. Similarly, the Sweden bilateral loan is a floating rate loan which resets every 3 months. The current rate of 1.337% applies for a 2 week initial period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">7. The interest rate charged by the IMF is variable. It is composed of a weekly setting of the IMF SDR interest rate and surcharges which are volume and time dependent. As of 25 June 2012 the SDR interest rate accruing on Ireland&rsquo;s IMF loans is 0.12% and the surcharges are 2.50% making a total of 2.62%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>Although there are no specific tax reliefs for video games producers, a broad range of tax reliefs are available for which video games producers could qualify. Some of these are detailed below.</P>
        <P>The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is available to the majority of trades, including video game producers. Under this scheme, companies can raise up to &euro;2.5 million per annum, subject to a lifetime limit of &euro;10 million. Investors will receive an initial 30% relief on their investment, with the possibility of a further 11% relief at the end of the holding period where the company has increased employment or spent at least 30% of the funding raised on research and development.</P>
        <P>The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is designed to reduce the cost to employers of assigning key individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of their employer. The programme provides for an exemption from income tax on 30% of salary between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 for employees that are assigned for a minimum of 1 year. The exemption is available for a maximum of 5 years. The scheme has been introduced for an initial three-year period ending on 31 December 2014, in order to allow for review. Any assignee that avails of the scheme during this time will have access to the relief for the period of their assignment, up to the maximum 5 years.</P>
        <P>A scheme was introduced in Budget 2009 which provides relief from corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies in the first three years of trading, and was modified in 2011 so that the value of the relief will be linked to the amount of employers&rsquo; PRSI paid by a company. Finance Bill 2012 extends this scheme for the next three years to include start-up companies which commence a new trade in 2012, 2013 or 2014.</P>
        <P>Digital games are essentially software development and would already be a field of science and technology for the purposes of the R&amp;D tax credit scheme. Relevant R&amp;D expenditure on games should already qualify under the existing terms of the tax credit scheme, provided any specific games development achieves scientific or technological advancement and involve the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty.</P>
        <P>The first &euro;100,000 of qualifying R&amp;D expenditure benefits from the 25% R&amp;D tax credit on a volume basis. The tax credit continues to apply to incremental R&amp;D expenditure in excess of &euro;100,000 as compared with such expenditure in the base year 2003.  The outsourcing limits for sub-contracted R&amp;D costs are the greater of 5 or 10% as appropriate or &euro;100k.  Companies in receipt of the R&amp;D credit have the option to use a portion of the credit to reward key employees who have been involved in the development of R&amp;D.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware the Board of the bank is responsible for the day to day operation of the bank including the management of staff members and structures generally. I have been informed by the bank that since nationalisation there has been a c. 65% reduction in total headcount (excluding NAMA servicing unit) in the combined Anglo Irish Bank and INBS organisations from close to 2,250 in January 2009 to 785 at the end of May 2012. IBRC also employs 271 staff in its NAMA servicing unit (of which 170 are front line NAMA loan servicing staff and the remainder, allocated support staff). As part of this reduction the bank has informed me that there has been an extensive restructuring and streamlining of the management structures in IBRC.</P>
        <P>In terms of remuneration, the bank has informed me that a 20% reduction was applied to the salaries of executive management in the former Anglo Irish Bank immediately post-nationalisation. Impacted individuals have since left the Bank, and the entire executive of the Bank has been renewed. Since nationalisation in January 2009 the Bank has pursued a policy of exerting downward pressure on headcount and remuneration packages generally across the Bank.</P>
        <P>The bank has further informed me that the total remuneration paid to the top 50 individuals in the organisation in 2009 has reduced by c.15% to date. In addition, total staff costs in the organisation have reduced by 48% from the end of the financial year 2008 to the end of 2011 and this includes 6 months of additional cost resulting from the merger with INBS in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Board of the bank has also considered further reductions in pay levels for individual staff and informed me that a decision has been reached not to implement cuts at this time. It should also be noted that IBRC does not operate a performance-based incentive plan to retain these individuals throughout the remaining wind-down period of the entity. The decision not to pursue further pay cuts is, I am informed, based on the need to retain staff which is integral the successful delivery of the Bank&rsquo;s asset recovery programme. The Board has also informed me that the position in relation to remuneration generally will be kept under review.</P>

        <P Just="Left">1. Non-euro liabilities are translated into euro at the rates of exchange at 15th June 2012. The net euro amount received by the Exchequer was &euro;49.4 billion after adjustment for below par issuance and deduction of a prepaid margin (Note 2), and also reflect the effect of foreign exchange transactions. Non-euro liabilities have been locked-in, as appropriate, in order to remove exchange rate risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">2. A prepaid margin of &euro;0.53 billion was deducted from the loan of &euro;4.19 billion drawdown on 1 February 2011 giving a net liability of &euro;3.67 billion. This margin prepayment will be refunded to Ireland in 2016. The total liability of &euro;50.46 billion included in the National Debt (&euro;130.1 billion at 15th  June 2012) takes account of this reduction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">3. Short Term EFSF Funding of &euro;1.48 billion maturing in 2012 is due to be replaced by longer term funding at a floating interest rate. The EFSF loan of &euro;1.27bn maturing in 2015 is also subject to rollover at a floating rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">4. The EFSF funding provided to Ireland under pooled issuance comes from a variety of fundings, and the EFSF will confirm the interest rate cost related to each loan coming from the pool on every interest payment date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">5. The Interest rates on the UK bilateral loans are subject to a reduction pending the signing of an amendment to the  legal agreement. The reduction is estimated, at this stage, to be about 1.5%. Rate shown is an annualised rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">6. The current rate on the Denmark bilateral loan is 1.787%. This rate resets every 3 months and is due to do so on 29th June 2012. Similarly, the Sweden bilateral loan is a floating rate loan which resets every 3 months. The current rate of 1.337% applies for a 2 week initial period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">7. The interest rate charged by the IMF  is variable. It is composed of a weekly setting of the IMF SDR interest rate and surcharges which are volume and time dependent. As of 25 June 2012 the SDR interest rate accruing on Ireland&rsquo;s IMF loans is 0.12% and the surcharges are 2.50% making a total of 2.62%.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Bank&rsquo;s policy in relation to lending rates is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.</P>
        <P>The Government and AIB are acutely aware of the social and economic impacts that any lending rate increases may have in the current environment. However, the bank has informed me that many of its lending products are currently priced below peers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as the Revenue Chairman stated before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in January this year, Revenue is examining in detail the 2,500 highest risk cases which are those cases where there is a mismatch between the Department of Social Protection (DSP) pension information contained on Revenue&rsquo;s records and the pensions data supplied by the DSP and, the taxpayer&rsquo;s non-DSP income exceeds &euro;50,000.  These cases are being examined individually and, where appropriate, correspondence is issuing to the taxpayers concerned affording them a thirty-day period to provide full income and other details to the Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I am advised that, from the analysis done to date, approximately 800 of the 2,500 cases have only been receiving a DSP pension since 2011 and consequently they will be liable for additional income tax for that year only.  In other cases the question of the payment of income tax due for years prior to 2011 may arise and some DSP pension recipients have already finalised and paid income tax for back years.  The Commissioners further advise that income tax may be due for a number of years, where, for example, an individual received Form 12 tax returns from Revenue for years prior to 2011 and did not complete and return these to Revenue and they were in receipt of a DSP pension during the years in question.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he supports the concept of banking union across the Eurozone and his views on how enhanced supervision of the banks at Eurozone level will proceed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30899/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the proposal for a banking union, first mooted by Commission President Barroso on 23 May, has developed over the last number of weeks in the context of the ongoing eurozone crisis, culminating in the paper on Economic and Monetary Union to be considered at this week&rsquo;s European Council meeting.  One of the main proposals in the paper on Economic and Monetary Union relates to an integrated Financial Framework. The main elements are: a) an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks; b) a European deposit insurance scheme, and c) a European resolution scheme.</P>
        <P>The President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, is due to present the report in close collaboration with the President of the European Commission, the Chair of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank at this week&rsquo;s European Council on 28 and 29 June to be attended by the Taoiseach.  The general principles of the integrated Financial Framework and how enhanced supervision of the banks at Eurozone level will proceed will be discussed in the context of that report.</P>
        <P>The creation of an integrated financial framework could be beneficial to Ireland but only if the impacts were to ease the burden of support the sovereign has provided to the banking sector. The Taoiseach will be addressing this further in the European Council debate.</P>
        <P>In the case of a European deposit insurance scheme and also a European resolution fund, it would be important to Ireland that these funds are truly mutual and that there is no direct link to the sovereign in the future related to calls on these funds.  For Ireland any mutualised bank resolution fund would only be of benefit if it applied retrospectively to cover the Irish bank recapitalisations.</P>
        <P>In relation to an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks, the current role of the European Banking Authority is mainly to oversee the functioning and convergence of national supervisory systems. An integrated system of supervision could only be agreed on if it definitively breaks the link of the sovereign to the banking sector. Shared supervision should be complimentary to shared risk and mutualisation of debt.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which the Strategic Investment Fund has raised capital in addition to the &euro;250m provided by the National Pension Reserve Fund; his views on the purchase by the Strategic Investment Fund of a stake renewable energy company; if this will result in any significant new job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The purpose of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) is to channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.  I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the NPRF, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. The Irish Infrastructure Fund was established in 2011 by Irish Life Investment Managers, with AMP Capital appointed as the fund&rsquo;s discretionary investment manager and the NPRF as a cornerstone investor. The Fund will seek up to &euro;1 billion from Irish and international investors and has already secured &euro;300 million from the NPRF and other Irish institutional investors. Marketing of the Fund, which is potentially a source of significant new capital for investment in infrastructure projects in Ireland, to potential investors both in Ireland and globally commenced in the first quarter of 2012. The Agency has confirmed that <b> </b>AMP Capital announced on 18 June 2012 the first investment by the Irish Infrastructure Fund  following its acquisition of a majority stake in a portfolio of wind farms from Viridian Group. The NPRF&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish Infrastructure Fund is part of the development of the Strategic Investment Fund,<i> </i>which will comprise a number of funds focused on sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy including infrastructure, financing for SMEs and venture capital. The NPRF, as a commercial and cornerstone minority investor in these funds, will act as a catalyst for attracting third-party investors, thereby increasing the size of the overall investment in the Irish economy.</P>

        <P>The minimum number of teaching days per school year at primary level is 183 full school days. Schools have local flexibility in determining how they make up the required number of teaching days, subject to adherence to the agreed standardisation in relation to the mid-term, Christmas and Easter breaks. Any additional days on which a school closes within this overall framework are a matter for the Board of Management of each school.</P>
        <P>School authorities also have discretion in relation to the need for exceptional school closures whether this arises from adverse weather, failure of heating or water system or other unforeseen reason. In general, a school closure due to unforeseen circumstances should be compensated for later in the school year.</P>
        <P>In the event that it is not possible to subsequently make up for such a school closure, the costs to the Exchequer will primarily relate to the school&rsquo;s staffing costs and this will depend on the size of the school in question.</P>

        <P>The decision on eligibility for new student grant applications is a matter for the central grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland).</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s student grant scheme, eligible candidates may receive funding provided they are attending an approved course at an approved institution as defined in the scheme. Students who are attending undergraduate courses in an EU Member State, can apply for a maintenance grant in respect of an approved course which is being pursued in an approved institution. The student grant scheme does not extend to postgraduate courses pursued outside of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual&rsquo;s application in relation means, residency, nationality and previous academic attainment, it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant. For example, from the details supplied it is not clear if the course to be pursued is at undergraduate or postgraduate level or if it will be pursued in an approved institution for grant purposes.</P>
        <P>The student is advised to submit a fully completed online grant application to SUSI via studentfinance.ie to have her eligibility for grant assistance assessed. Further information on the student grant is available on the studentfinance.ie website.</P>
        <P>Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees. Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>Firstly I wish to clarify for the Deputy that there is no overall reduction in Special Needs Assistant (SNA) numbers for the coming school year. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</P>
        <P>SENOs are currently notifying schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</P>
        <P>SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>Students entering postgraduates courses who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270 under the Student Grant Scheme. A further limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. The new income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2012/13 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents.</P>
        <P>Following the changes introduced in Budget 2012 new students entering postgraduate courses, from the 2012/13 academic year onwards, will not be entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme. Postgraduate students continuing on their existing courses will not be affected.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above means-tested supports, this year my Department is providing some &euro;38 million to support research activities across a range of programmes, including schemes managed by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET). These schemes specifically focus on providing funding support to postgraduate students and early-career post doctoral fellows. The closing date for applications for postgraduate scholarships for the 2012/2013 academic year is now closed. A call for applications for the 2013/2014 academic year will issue towards the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need. Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my priority is to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected pupil increases in the future. The 5 Year Plan that I announced in March last as part of a &euro;2 billion capital investment programme outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan. These have been prioritised on the basis of meeting significant demographic needs.</P>
        <P>To cater for the demographic demand at primary level in the area referred to by the Deputy, a new primary school will be established in 2013. This is in addition to a number of extension projects at schools in the area which were included in the March announcement to meet projected demographic demand.</P>
        <P>While the proposed project at the school will not provide for new demographic need, it will replace the school&rsquo;s existing temporary accommodation. The next step to progress the project involves the appointment of a design team and the commencement of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>School building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.</P>

        <P>I announced my intention to commence the divesting of patronage process immediately in an initial 44 identified areas.  The first step in this process is to gather evidence on the scale of divestment required in the identified areas.  Parental surveys are to commence in the autumn.  The New Schools Establishment Group&rsquo;s remit will be expanded to support the divesting process.</P>
        <P>I also announced that I have decided that there should be a public consultation process on the findings and recommendations in the report with regard to promoting more inclusiveness in schools, particularly in &ldquo;Stand Alone Schools&rdquo; where transfer of patronage is not an option.  A formal call for submissions will issue in September with a deadline for receipt of submission of end November.</P>
        <P>After this, the Forum Report findings and recommendations in this area and the submissions received will be considered in the preparation of a White Paper which will chart the way forward taking account of the views expressed with the aim of having a final draft White Paper prepared by early 2013.</P>
        <P>I will also be asking the NCCA to explore, with the education partners and religious interests, the development of Education about Religions and Beliefs and Ethics programmes. The inclusive processes of the NCCA will allow an opportunity for all interested parties, including faith and non-faith interests to have their views taken into account as to the place of such programmes.</P>
        <P>The Advisory Group made a number of recommendations concerning the provision of Irish medium schools and I have decided to proceed immediately with the analysis of the start-up and growth of Irish medium schools as proposed by the Advisory Group.

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198, 202 and 203 together.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (Croke Park Agreement) provides for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in most parts of the public service, and for these arrangements to take precedence over other methods of filling vacancies.</P>
        <P>In the Education sector new redeployment procedures for second level teachers were implemented in advance of the 2011/2012 school year resulting in the elimination of a surplus of some 200 teachers.  62 teachers at post primary level were surplus to requirements this year and have been successfully redeployed in advance of the commencement of the 2012/13 school year.</P>
        <P>Redeployment procedures at primary level were implemented in advance of the 2011/12 school year with some 950 surplus teachers re-deployed.  A total of 463 primary teachers were surplus to requirements this year and to date 395 have been redeployed to other schools or were assigned to new permanent or fixed term vacancies in their own school.  Accordingly, there are currently 68 teachers at primary level awaiting re-deployment and it is anticipated that all of these teachers will be redeployed in advance of the 2012/13 school year.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) has put in place a system of Resource/Redeployment Panels to support the redeployment processes in those sectors, including the Education sector, agreed under the Public Service Agreement.  This system is utilised to facilitate the re-deployment of staff (other than teachers and SNAs) in the Education sector.  There are currently 26 staff from the Education sector on the Public Appointments Service (PAS) Redeployment panel pending their re-deployment to an alternative permanent position elsewhere in the public service.  The maximum period of time that a person from the Education sector has been on the PAS resource panel awaiting permanent re-deployment is approximately 10 months.</P>

        <P>In the event such a fillable vacancy arises at my Department the Public Appointments Service (PAS), which was established under the terms of the Public Service management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, would be contacted in order to establish if there was an official on the Redeployment Panel that could be assigned to the vacant position. In the event this does not address the matter the PAS would then be requested to conduct a recruitment competition on behalf of my Department.</P>

        <P>I assume it was the Deputy&rsquo;s intention to refer to the Secondary Education Committee rather than the State Examinations Commission.</P>
      
        <P>There are 26 distinctively Protestant schools and one Jewish school. Of these schools, the Jewish school and 20 of the Protestant schools charge fees. Many of the schools have a boarding facility, reflecting the dispersed nature of the communities across the country. The six Protestant schools within the free education scheme receive the same funding as all other schools within the free education system.</P>
      
        <P>This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
      
        <P>With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is paid to the Secondary Education Committee, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the schools. The Secondary Education Committee then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of boarding fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. There are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant.</P>
     
        <P>The mechanism used to calculate the funding is no longer linked to the number of students attending these schools, rather it is based on an assessment of the needs to address the needs of children of minority faiths who wish to attend of a reform church or Protestant ethos.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
        <P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule for the 2012-2013 school year, Circular 0007/2012, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. As part of the new staffing arrangements my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the Department&rsquo;s Staffing Circular 0007/2012.</P>
        <P>The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</P>
      
        <P>All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</P>
      
        <P>SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</P>
      
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
      
        <P>Firstly, I wish advise the Deputy that there is no overall reduction in Resource Teaching numbers for the coming school year. </P>
      
        <P>Overall, 9,950 posts will be provided for Resource Teaching support for the 2012/13 school year, the same number as that provided for last year and an increase of 350 over that provided for in 2010.</P>
      
        <P>5,500 of these posts are available to the NCSE for allocation for pupils with assessed low incidence special educational needs. This number cannot be exceeded under the Employment Control Framework (ECF).</P>
      
        <P>For the 2011/12 school year an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations was made to schools by the NCSE to schools in order to provide schools with the majority of their allocation while preserving enough capacity to deal with all applications received and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills remained within ECF obligations.</P>
      
        <P>The number of valid applications received by the NCSE for the 2012/2013 school year to date has risen marginally with rising enrolments in schools. Therefore, in order to ensure there are sufficient remaining posts to make allocations for late or emergency applications, while staying within the ECF, the NCSE will initially allocate 85% of assessed needs to schools.</P>
      
        <P>This will ensure that there are a sufficient number of posts retained to make allocations for late or emergency applications, while staying within the ECF.</P>
      
        <P>The total amount of resource hours provided to pupils with low incidence special educational needs in the 2010/11 school year was 122,670. This compares with 114,450 to date in the 2012/13 school year. In addition, the NCSE has a further 430 Whole Time Equivalent posts available to meet late or emergency applications that arise in primary and post primary schools during the 2012/13 school year. This will enable the NCSE to provide between 9,460 and 10,750 additional hours to meet such applications for the coming school year.</P>
      
        <P>The allocation of resource hours in respect of individual pupils ranges from 180 minutes to 300 minutes per week in accordance with the category of disability as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 02/05. This is the allocation which applied in the 2010/11 school year. The application of an 85% allocation in the 2012/13 school year is equivalent to 153 minutes to 255 minutes resource hours per week, in accordance with the category of disability set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 02/05.</P>
     
        <P>Schools are being asked to make up any time lost through grouping of students and more effective management of teaching time, to ensure that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same.</P>
      
        <P>As such, schools have responsibility to monitor and utilise these resources to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Departments guidance. Neither my Department nor the NCSE is in a position to monitor or analyse how schools use these resources.</P>
      
        <P>Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources available to my Department are utilised to optimum benefit to ensure the best possible outcomes for students with special educational needs. In this regard my Department is seeking advice from the NCSE on policy options for the allocation of these resources in future, with a view to ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient model is in place in the coming years.</P>

        <P>The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects.</P>
      
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. Therefore, it is not time bound.</P>
      
        <P>The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.</P>
      
        <P>To further support teachers in using ICT in the curriculum, the NCCA developed the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Teachers as a supporting document to the Primary School Curriculum 1999. The guidelines were launched by the Department of Education and Science (DES) in 2004.</P>
      
        <P>I am currently leading the reform of the Junior Cycle. A Framework for the revised Junior Cycle has been prepared. It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of the Statements of Learning aims to ensure that all students &ldquo;use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life&rdquo;.</P>
      
        <P>The reform will also allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide a new opportunity for schools to progress the provision of short courses to enhance students&rsquo; ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning. Such courses could include software programming and coding, if a school so chooses.</P>

        <P>The Prefab Replacement Initiative announced in March 2012 deals with schools that have been renting prefabs over a number of years rather than those schools with solely purchased prefabs on site.

        <P>In 2008, my Department undertook a review of the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  The review the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.</P>
      
        <P>In February 2011, the schools referred to by the Deputy were informed in writing and through discussions with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department that better value for money could be achieved in the buy-out rather than rental of the existing prefab accommodation.  All rented prefabs at the schools were purchased at that time.</P>
      
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for this Government contains a commitment to reduce the reliance on rented prefabs in schools and this resulted in my announcement in March 2012 of a rental prefab replacement initiative.</P>
      
        <P>I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will appreciate that the buy-out of rented prefabs at these schools took place prior to this announcement and it was not possible to anticipate the policy changes to tackle the issue of expenditure on rental of prefabs in schools at that time.</P>

In relation to school transport provision, ethos relates to religious ethos and is in the context of provision for minority religions.

I also said that I broadly accept the recommendations on divestment made by the Advisory Group and I have requested that the process leading to divesting of patronage in areas of stable population begin immediately.  The divesting process will involve the gathering of evidence by the Forward Planning Section of the Department of Education and Skills on the scale of divestment required in the identified areas. Parents will be given full information on the different types of schools and the different patron bodies.  Surveys of parents will begin in the first identified areas in the autumn.  Among the areas to be surveyed in this initial phase are the Dublin 4, 6 and 8 areas. The completed survey data of parental preferences will inform any divesting proposals in the areas.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</P>
        <P>SENOs are currently notifying schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  It is important to note that a school&rsquo;s allocation of SNA support may alter from year to year as pupils enrol or leave a school or where a child&rsquo;s care needs have diminished over time.  If a school is notified of a change in SNA support this is either because the number of qualifying children has changed or the assessed needs of the qualifying children have changed.  The NCSE may only allocate SNAs to schools where valid applications meet the qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

However, I expect that the new boards will be established early in 2013 and work on the budgets for each of the boards will be undertaken later this year.  My Department published Circular 24/2012 on 19 June 2012 which detailed the categorisation of the new Education and Training Boards for the purposes of the pay scales applicable to Chief Executive Officers of these Boards.  The categorisation is based on a proposal set out by the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Skills in</askee>
        <Quest> the context of the July provision and funding for tuition at home for children with a disability, if he will confirm the changes that have been introduced to the scheme which prevent qualified teachers who are also parents of a qualifying child applying for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>The July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July. My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided in cases where parents have to source and fund a qualified teacher to undertake the tuition. The cost of home based tuition is then reimbursed to the parents by my Department.</P>
        <P>It has never been an expressed feature of this scheme that parents of a qualifying child, whether they are qualified teachers or otherwise, would qualify to act as the tutor for the purposes of this scheme. The expectation that parents should source a third party tutor is clear from the terms and conditions provided to applicants.  This year, my Department has, for clarification purposes, restated the requirement to source a teacher to deliver the home based provision. In exceptional circumstances where parents have exhausted all other options to secure a qualified teacher, approval may be considered.  Requests for such exceptions will be considered by my officials on a case by case basis.  My Department has taken these steps, this year, to ensure that the scheme is managed prudently and effectively. An important feature of the scheme is the Department&rsquo;s ability to satisfy itself that the tuition has been delivered in line with the conditions of the scheme and that the substantial grants paid are used for the intended purpose. This can only be fully achieved by parents verifying that the tuition was delivered and by Teachers verifying that they received the payments.</P>

My Department issued a Circular (56/2011) to primary schools regarding the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy in November 2011 and this may be accessed on the website of my Department.  This circular to primary schools covered issues relating to time for the teaching of literacy (in English and Irish), assessment and a number of other related issues. The Department will issue a similar Circular to post-primary schools shortly. The Circular to primary schools applied to all primary schools, including Gaelscoileanna. The Circular to post-primary schools will also apply to all schools. </P>

The Design Team are currently working on the Stage 2a Submission (Developed Sketch Design) and, when complete, the school will forward this submission to my Department for review. Assuming no issues arise, the project will then proceed to stage 2(b) which includes planning permission and the preparation of tender documents.</P>
        <P>To ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the next 5 years, particularly in those areas where most future demographic growth will be concentrated.  The project referred to by the Deputy will continue to progress through the design stages of architectural planning. However, due to competing demands on my Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress the project to tender and construction stage.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has decided that a salary ceiling of &euro;200,000 will apply to future appointments to senior positions across the Public Service.  Since becoming Minister I have written to the Chairpersons of University Governing Bodies requesting them to ask all relevant individuals, including Presidents, who earn in excess of &euro;200,000, to make voluntary waivers of salary. While two individuals, one of whom is a university Head, have agreed to make personal arrangements with their employer regarding a deduction of the amount of salary over &euro;200,000, there have been no voluntary waivers made for the benefit of the State.  I cannot enforce a voluntary waiver nor can I insist that a waiver, if made, follows any particular format. For example, if an employee chooses to waive a portion of his/her salary in favour of a charity or their employer they are free to do so.  Based on the most recent data available, there are 1,631 public servants in the Education Sector whose remuneration currently exceeds &euro;100,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>The programme for Government clearly states that education is a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  One of my Department&rsquo;s high level goals is to provide a quality inclusive school and early years&rsquo; education system with improved learning outcomes.  A key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the educational system for disadvantaged groups.  Inclusion and fairness is at the core of all policies in education and in the delivery of measures across the education spectrum.</P>
        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion remains my Department&rsquo;s policy instrument to address educational disadvantage which focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education.  A sustained programme of investment in early childhood care and education is being implemented to ensure increased provision for children at this critical age.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life: The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020&rdquo; was launched in July 2011.  The strategy stresses that developing good literacy and numeracy skills among all young people is fundamental to the life chance of each individual and essential to the quality and equity of Irish society.  The strategy sets out a range of objectives and actions in relation to improving outcomes for students who are most marginalised and disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>The intercultural education strategy is being implemented to assist in the creation of an intercultural, integrated and inclusive learning environment in all sectors of education.  In the light of the very difficult economic situation, and the significant costs involved, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  It is intended to give consideration to the development of a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act, subject to the restrictions of the current fiscal position, so as to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.</P>
        <P>The principal objectives of further education programmes, which have a strong social inclusion element, are to meet the needs of young early school leavers, provide second-chance education for people who did not complete upper second level, and provide vocational preparation and training for labour market entrants and re-entrants.  A wide range of actions to improve access to third level education are being progressed through the implementation of the national plan for equity of access to higher aducation (2008-2013).</P>
        <P>My Department cooperates with other Government Departments and agencies where cross-departmental and inter-agency responses are required in the development and implementation of policies.  The reform agenda for the education sector as set out in the programme for Government is also being progressed through my membership of key Cabinet committees &mdash; social policy, economic recovery and jobs, European affairs, Irish and the Gaeltacht and public sector reform.</P>

        <P>A dedicated Capital Asset Test implementation group has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013/14 academic year.</P>
        <P>No decision has been taken on the treatment of farm or other business assets.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to say at this time what assets may be included.

        <P>As advised in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question in this matter on 11 January, 2012, the area concerned was assessed under the ongoing Fingal-East Meath Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The draft Flood Risk Management Plan prepared as part of this study was put out to public consultation, which concluded on 30 January, 2012. </P>
        <P>I understand that Fingal County Council is currently working with consultants, Halcrow Barry, to finalise the plan and the preferred option identified for Strand Road at draft plan stage is unaltered following the public consultation process.  It would be a matter for Fingal County Council to bring forward proposals to implement the options identified in the plan.</P>
        <P>In relation to the proposed works at Golf Links Road, the Office of Public Works (OPW) recently introduced revised criteria for coastal protection measures under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  On foot of the revised criteria, the OPW has written to all relevant local authorities requesting that they re-prioritise any outstanding funding applications for coastal protection measures and resubmit to the OPW for assessment under the new criteria.</P>
        <P>Any revised application received for Golf Links Road will be assessed in accordance with the current criteria, the availability of resources for flood risk management and will also have regard to the outcome of the CFRAM study process.</P>

It also operates as the sanctioning authority for ICT expenditure in the public service.  It represents Ireland at EU level in relation to public service ICT and eGovernment.  The Director of CMOD, at Assistant Secretary level, represents Ireland on the EU&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer (CIO) Network.  </P>
        <P>In November 2011, my Department established a Public Service CIO Council in accordance with our commitment in the Public Service Reform Plan.  This CIO Council is chaired by the Director of CMOD and comprises a representative sample of the most senior and experienced ICT and eGovernment personnel in the public service.  The purpose of the Council is to work with CMOD in developing ICT and eGovernment policies, procedures, principles and best practices for the public service, reflecting Government policies and supporting the reform programme.  The Council discusses key ICT and eGovernment  issues, and provides expert input to decisions and actions aimed at maximising the positive impact of these on public service modernisation and customer service.  For example, since its establishment, the Council has assisted with the development of the new eGovernment Strategy which I published in April and with the development of a Cloud Computing Strategy which I hope to bring to Government in the coming weeks.  The Council may also establish working groups to research and/or develop proposals/recommendations for specific topics or actions.  The Council determines the composition, size, mandate, terms of reference and timelines for such working groups, subject to ethical safeguards and avoiding conflicts of interest.  This would include engagement with industry, academia and professional bodies.  Full details of the Council&rsquo;s membership and operation will be published on a new website for the Council shortly.</P>

        <P>The strategic future direction of the Civil Service Language Centre (CSLC) is the subject of deliberations within my Department at present in consultation with the relevant interested parties.  The context to this deliberative process is a reduction in the funding available for foreign language teaching and the ongoing requirement to ensure greater cost effectiveness in the delivery of  staff in-service training of this nature.  The foreign languages traditionally delivered by the CSLC to civil servants (including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) include modern European languages (French, German, Spanish Italian) and Irish Sign Language. Bespoke language training has also been provided to staff on the basis of the particular requirements of their employing organisation. Costs associated with the provision of this service, apart from administrative and incidental costs, derive from the salaries paid to the cohort of part-time teachers delivering the training programmes.  Details for the period requested are as follows:</P>

These developments are also pertinent to the non availability of Irish language training programmes at present.  </P>

        <P>The House will be aware from my announcement of22 February that the Government has decided to pursue the sale of a number of State assets. It is foreseen that transactions will commence in 2013.   Under this State asset disposal programme, separate sale processes and timelines will apply to each individual transaction. My Department, supported by the NewERA unit of the National Treasury Management Agency, which is acting as the Government&rsquo;s financial advisor in respect of the programme, will evaluate market conditions on a continuous basis up to the launch of each transaction to ensure that likely market appetite is understood before any process is commenced.  In this regard, I would point out that, despite ongoing turbulence in financial markets, transactions continue to complete across the Eurozone, including, for example, SSE&rsquo;s recent purchase of Endesa&rsquo;s Irish electricity generation assets.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on whether the projected increase in 2012 in respect of the combined public sector pay and pensions bill as compared to 2011 highlights a need for accelerated implementation of the Croke Park Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[30782/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
        <P>Over the period 2009-2015 the cost of the Exchequer Pay Bill will reduce from a peak in 2009 of &euro;17.5bn (gross) in 2009 to &euro;13.7bn (net of Pension Related Deduction) in 2015, effecting a saving of &euro;3.8bn. The pensions bill is estimated to increase from &euro;2.6 to &euro;3.1 billion (an increase of &euro;0.5bn) in the same period as compared to the saving of &euro;3.8 billion in pay costs.   However, within that overall substantial decline, falls will be greater in some years than others depending on the rate of retirements etc. The forecast increase in the Pay and Pensions Bill for 2012 is accounted for by an increase of &euro;285m in the Pension Bill which will exceed the expected reduction in the pay bill of &euro;270m (gross) or &euro;250m (net of Pension Related Reduction). Pension costs include the once off costs of superannuation lump sums payable under public service superannuation schemes (generally 1.5 times the annual rate of pensionable remuneration for full-length careers).  Given the higher retirement rates of recent years, and particularly in the current year due to the expiry of the &ldquo;Grace Period&rdquo;, these lump-sum pay outs will naturally tend to increase the annual pension cost out-turns.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Body noted in its Second Annual Progress Report that the sustainability of the Agreement will be measured against its ability to accelerate the pace of change across the public service and its potential for extracting further Exchequer pay bill savings and non-pay administrative efficiency savings through the early implementation of key deliverables across sectors.  It concluded that accelerating change now needs to occur across all public service bodies, in every sector, with an increased sense of urgency and that there is a need to go much further in this regard in view of the ongoing difficult circumstances facing the country.   The Government would share this view.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There has been an overall increase in PMDS completion rates since 2009.  In that year, completion of PMDS was at 56%, rising to 69% in 2010 and to 77% in 2011.</P>
        <P>The central aim of any performance management system is to support managers and employees in improving the performance of the individual and, in turn, the performance of the organisation.</P>
        <P>The most important element of how effective performance management will be in an organisation is the skills and talent of line managers.  My Department has developed a range of tools to support line managers in developing good management skills.</P>
        <P>In addition to the skills of line management, it is also critical that the performance management system itself is designed in such a way as to support management and staff in delivering high performance levels. My Department carried out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the performance management and development system used in the Civil Service in 2010. <i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010</i>  identified a number of problems with how PMDS is currently operating.</P>
        <P>My Department has been working with management and unions, in accordance with commitments in Croke Park to strengthen performance management in the Civil Service, and has agreed changes to strengthen performance management.</P>
        <P>In 2011 changes were introduced aimed at improving the operation of PMDS. This involved streamlining the paperwork associated with PMDS primarily to create space for more discussion about performance between staff and managers. Critically we are increasing manager accountability for managing performance by giving a low rating to managers who do not manage the performance of their staff proactively i.e. a manager who has not been managing their staff (including the completion of PMDS for their staff) should not get a rating above 2.  My Department alongside management of the Civil Service and unions is now engaged in a process of identifying ways to improve more fundamental problems with PMDS.  <i>The Evaluation of PMDSSurvey 2010</i>   highlighted that one of the main underlying problems with PMDS is a perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of the system.  In this regard, my Department is currently negotiating with the unions on further changes to PMDS aimed at improving fairness and consistency and the operation of PMDS from both a management and a staff perspective.</P>
        <P>The ultimate aim of any changes to PMDS is to ensure that the PMDS system itself will support the improvement of individual and organisational performance across the Civil Service and that it is applied in a more fair and consistent manner.</P>

        <P>The Government intention in introducing the <i>Jobs Initiative 2011</i> was to focus our now more limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.  The <i>Jobs Initiative 2011</i> is one element of the Government&rsquo;s wider and ongoing strategy to support economic activity.  The aim is to target key sectors of the economy that can assist in getting people back to work, providing opportunities for those who have lost their jobs to re-skill and building confidence in order to encourage consumer activity.  Given our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and our current public finance difficulties, the <i>Jobs Initiative 2011</i> was constructed to be budgetary neutral over the period to 2014.   Funding of current expenditure   measures announced in the Jobs Initiative is being met from a combination of re-prioritisation of existing resources and additional funding arising from the introduction of a temporary levy on pension funds.  The total additional current expenditure to specified areas of &euro;29 million in 2011 was to be funded by reallocations of &euro;18 million from within existing current resources and &euro;11 million from the introduction of the levy on pension funds in 2011.  In a full year the total additional current expenditure to specified areas of &euro;45 million was to be funded through &euro;15 million of the additional expenditure from within existing resources and &euro;30 million from the levy on pension funds.  </P>
        <P>Funding for Capital projects in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  provided an additional &euro;30 million for labour intensive school works and associated works in 2011 over the existing allocation. Some &euro;20 million of this was reallocated by the Minister for Education and Skills from within his own Department&rsquo;s allocation.  A further &euro;10 million of Exchequer funding was provided to the Department from the proceeds of the new pension levy announced in the Initiative.  This was allocated to &ldquo;ready-to-go&rdquo; projects to be delivered by schools.</P>
        <P>The Initiative also provided for &euro;60 million to be reallocated from within the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport&rsquo;s overall allocation to invest in our regional and local roads to carry out much-needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works.  This important, remedial work allowed local authorities to bring forward important projects to 2011 that had previously been pushed back to 2012.  A further &euro;15 million was allocated to Smarter Travel projects.</P>
        <P>&euro;30 million was assigned to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, comprising of &euro;19 million additional Exchequer funding as well as a reallocation of &euro;11 million from within the existing 2011 allocation, for investment in the national retrofit, home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes.</P>
        <P>Individual Ministers and their Departments are responsible for the roll out of these expenditure programmes and should be in a position to provide further information if requested by the Deputy. Detailed expenditure allocations for voted expenditure in 2012 and the provisional outturns for 2011 have been published in the  <i>Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012.</i></P>

        <P>The Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland (CAI) is a non-government, independent and non-profit organisation. The Association, which is a registered charity, is mainly funded by subscriptions from its members and by the sale of its magazine <i>Consumer Choice</i>.</P>
        <P>My Department has previously provided funding to the Association to support appropriate projects to assist in enhancing the Association&rsquo;s capacity to represent consumers&rsquo; interests. The Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that value for money is the uppermost consideration when expending public money and any application from the CAI for funding must be evaluated in that context. No applications were received by my Department from the CAI in 2011 or in 2012 (to date) for funding.</P>

        <P>Currently, my Department has two staff in the redeployment pool and there are no further staff waiting to be redeployed.  Since the beginning of 2011, nineteen staff transferred out of my Department on redeployment.  The maximum period of time that a staff member has been waiting for redeployment was approximately two months.</P>
        <P>The Employment Control Framework (ECF) requires my Department to reduce staff numbers year on year until the end of 2015.  At this point staff numbers in my Department are in line with targets set under the ECF programme and I am confident that the end of year target will be met.</P>

        <P>I have no statutory remit concerning this body.  EPACE is a non-statutory private limited company comprising employer and trade union representatives from the electrical sector. I understand that the primary objective of EPACE is to advise Electrical Contractors operating in the State of their responsibilities under the Electrical Registered Employment Agreement (REA) and to seek compliance with same. </P>
        <P>I am informed that to achieve this objective EPACE carries out inspections of employer&rsquo;s records with a view to verifying compliance with the Electrical Registered Employment Agreement. However being a non-statutory body and having no statutory authority to inspect records, EPACE relies on the co-operation of employers. As EPACE is a   non-statutory private limited company I have no function or plans in relation to the company.</P>

        <P>Recruitment to F&Aacute;S courses for unemployed people is based on referral by Employment Services Officers of my Department. Referral is based on an officer&rsquo;s assessment of whether the client has the aptitude and ability to complete the training and whether this training will improve the client&rsquo;s prospects of being offered and accepting employment. In all cases, participation on a training programme should be on the basis of a clear plan and commitment to enter/re-enter the workforce. The assessment in each case will take account of the client&rsquo;s prior training record and the likely usefulness, for the client, of the particular further training being considered.  </P>
        <P>In the case of F&Aacute;S courses leading to Major Awards at Levels 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), current guidelines are that a client may complete only one such training programme within a two year period. This &lsquo;two year rule&rsquo; is in place to support Employment Services Officers in their role to progress clients through a defined progression path that leads clients to employment, and to avoid the possibility of clients being &ldquo;re-cycled&rdquo; through a series of unrelated major courses. It does not apply to shorter/evening/online courses leading to Minor qualifications, nor to courses leading to Major qualifications at levels below Level 5.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, an officer may provide for a client to be referred to a second major award course at Level 5-10 within the two-year period where this can be shown to meet particular needs and where a training place is available that does not involve  the displacement of other priority clients.</P>

There are currently approximately 8,640 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications registered and awaiting a decision.  Of these, there are 9 cases that have been awaiting a decision for more than 40 weeks.

        <Quest> the average time to process a claim for carer&rsquo;s allowance including an assessment of medical evidence, means, residency and confirmation that the full time care condition has been satisfied; the number of cases awaiting a decision of more than 30 weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers. Currently the average time taken to award a carer&rsquo;s allowance application is 28 weeks. There are currently approximately 8,640 new carer&rsquo;s allowance applications registered and awaiting a decision.  Of these, approximately 1,450 cases have been awaiting a decision for more than 30 weeks.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking action to resolve the situation. A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers. Full deployment of the new system for carer&rsquo;s allowance has completed this month.  In tandem with the full implementation of the new system, a comprehensive business process improvement exercise is commencing on the 2nd July, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service. However it is expected to be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</P>

        <P>The Government has provided various types of support to people affected by the November 2009 flooding. Humanitarian aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to offer support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering relocating rather than permanently returning to their original home.   A letter inviting the household to formally apply for assistance toward relocation issued from the Department in November 2011.  A number of the families, who received these letters, requested a meeting to discuss their particular case. These meetings took place between March and June this year.</P>
        <P>The information necessary to make a decision on the amount payable in all cases is being finalised at present and it is expected that this amount will be communicated to the affected households in the coming weeks. Additionally, Department officials are currently in consultation with the Chief State Solicitors Office to finalise legal agreements which will need to be signed by all parties to the agreement. Payment will issue to families in accordance with these legal agreements.</P>

        <P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide up to 5,000 short-term work opportunities for those who have been fully unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for at least 12 months, and who are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at the time of application.  </P>
        <P>Currently, under the initiative, there are 4,271 participants and 230 supervisors engaged in the provision of services to their communities.  Recruitment to supervisory positions is conducted by local development companies and governed by the same eligibility criteria as applies to the random selection of participants.  This requires that a candidate must have been continuously unemployed for at least 12 months and be in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment at the time of application.</P>
        <P>For this reason, persons who are engaged in community employment or who had breaks in the period of unemployment may not be eligible.  As recruitment to all supervisory positions is nearing completion, I am not in a position to alter the criteria.  The Deputy will appreciate that the criteria ensures that those who have more limited access to work are being prioritised for these opportunities.</P>

        <P>The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism. </P>
        <P>A report of a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay held in February 2012 is now available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/CorporatePublications/Finance/exp_rev/Pages/consultation.aspx</i>.  Amongst other things, the report reflects the concerns expressed by organisations representing smaller enterprises and these concerns will be taken into account as the range of complex issues associated with the introduction of such a scheme continue to be considered.</P>
        <P>The issues involved will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of Budget 2013 and any decisions which might be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme will be considered in that context.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 294, 295 and 296 together.</P>
        <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are provided in the following table.  Generally the vast majority of cases fall within average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.</P>
        <P>These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</P>
        <P>In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers since between 2010 and 2011. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39. In addition to this, the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</P>

        <P>Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that Ireland now faces and it is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues. To this end, last year I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. Among the issues provided for under the Advisory Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference is for the Group to examine and report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. </P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support. Decisions in respect of publishing reports of the Group will be made at the appropriate time.  The Group will revert to me with its report on its considerations and recommendations on social insurance coverage for the self-employed once their examination of the various questions has been completed.</P>

        <P>The Department participated in the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (referred to as the Keane group) and is a member of the Steering Group set up by the Minister for Finance to oversee and drive its overall recommendations</P>
        <P>This Group recommended that an independent Mortgage Support and Advice Service be established to advise mortgage holders in arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options.</P>
        <P>The publication of the heads of the Personal Insolvency Bill in January 2012 proposes the introduction of a four step process to address personal insolvency issues with the first three steps involving non-judicial debt settlement arrangements.  This is a new arrangement and was not envisaged when the thinking in support of a Mortgage Advisory Service was originally proposed.  The Department is examining the role envisaged for the Personal Insolvency Trustee to ensure that there is no conflict with or duplication of Government supported services.  From the customers perspective for example, the target group and complexity of the problems that need to be addressed appear to be similar and from the advisory perspective, the skills and expertise required would also appear to be similar for both services.</P>
        <P>The Department is chairing a Working Group as part of the Implementation Steering Group to examine the issues relating to the establishment of the Mortgage Advice Service including any staff requirement.  The needs of the customer, the importance of ease of access and information on services and the way in which the services will be made available will be to the fore.</P>
        <P>Given that more than 70,000 people have already entered into arrangements with their lenders, it is important that any new service would focus on those who have yet to engage with their lender and support those who are in the earlier stages of negotiations with their lender as a first step in seeking to resolve their difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Working Group has not yet fully concluded its deliberations.  It reports regularly to the Implementation Steering Group and to the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </P>
        <P>Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or social insurance illness benefits, would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund examines this matter and I will be examining this in detail.</P>

        <Quest>    if she will confirm that persons with special needs such as those with disabilities or those coming from situations of homelessness may have higher rent levels under the rent supplement scheme due to their specialised housing requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>

        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 92,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with &euro;436 million provided for 2012. </P>
        <P>Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  The general practice is that rent supplement is not paid where the rent is above the relevant limit.</P>
        <P>However, rent supplement may be paid in cases where the rent is above the relevant limit where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances.  This may include a person with a disability in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme.</P>

        <P>The integration of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion to form the new Social Inclusion Division in the Department took place on 1st July 2009.  A strategic plan setting out the functions and objectives for the Division was agreed between the outgoing Board of the agency and the Department, which encompassed the key areas of competence of the agency.  </P>
        <P>The Division transferred to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2010.  With the re-assignment of functions from that Department in 2011, the functions of the Division were transferred back to the Department of Social Protection by statutory instrument.  They include co-ordinating the implementation of Government policies for social inclusion, promoting the implementation of poverty impact assessment in government policy making, analysing the impact and effectiveness of public policy on poverty, promoting data and research to inform anti-poverty policies and practice, monitoring poverty trends, developing mechanisms to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty in policy development and implementation and promoting co-operation on social inclusion issues between Ireland and other countries.</P>
        <P>The Division continues to meet these functions and plays a lead role in co-ordinating Government policies against poverty and for social inclusion at national and EU levels. For instance, in the last six months, the Division has:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />convened the Social Inclusion Forum attended by a wide range of community and voluntary organisations;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />produced the Social Inclusion Report to monitor progress on the implementation of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion for 2009 and 2010;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />led the review of the national poverty target to enable Government to adopt appropriate and achievable targets to meet Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the commitments in the Programme for Government; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />published new research on childhood deprivation and convened a national conference with key stakeholders to discuss its findings and policy implications, and has supported a summer school by University College Cork on conceptualising and measuring poverty in the 21st Century.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 and 324 together.</P>
        <P>Activity on all 53 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation, where the requirement to cease turf cutting applies, is being monitored on an ongoing basis, both from the ground and from the air.</P>
        <P>Where evidence of unlawful cutting is detected, it is investigated and enforcement action is undertaken jointly by officials of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Evidence gathered through this monitoring and surveillance work can be used for pursuing the individuals concerned.  Sanctions available where the law is breached include prosecution, the impounding of machinery, and the recovery of remediation and restoration costs from individuals who have caused environmental damage.  Thus far, some 70 letters have issued from my Department warning turf cutters and contractors about the implications and potential consequences of illegal turf cutting.  This work is continuing.</P>
        <P>Persons undertaking unauthorised works on protected sites may also risk future Single Farm payments, Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) payments, or payments under my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme.  In addition, persons who carry out unauthorised works or permit such works to be carried out on these sites may jeopardise the receipt of compensation under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme, administered by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has begun to cross-report unlawful turf cutting to the Cross Compliance Section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine &mdash; some 45 such reports have been transmitted so far. 28 of these reports relate to turf cutting on bogs in County Galway, with the remaining 17 relating to bogs in County Roscommon.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336, 337 and 340 together. </P>
        <P>The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended. ComReg is independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function.</P>
        <P>In accordance with its statutory functions, ComReg has consulted extensively on its proposals for the release of spectrum rights of use in the 800 Mhz, 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz frequency bands.</P>
        <P>I am advised that ComReg received considerable interest in this consultation process which has resulted in the decision document for the award of a number of individual rights of use in the 800 Mhz, 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz radio spectrum bands (ComReg Document 12/25 and Decision 04/12 published on 16 March 2012).  ComReg&rsquo;s Information Memorandum for this award process details the processes and procedures ComReg is employing to implement its substantive decisions (ComReg Document 12/52 published on 25 May 2012).</P>
        <P>The reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its decisions on the minimum coverage and roll-out requirements are set out in section 5.5 of Document 12/25.  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed the 70% population obligation by a considerable margin given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  It should be noted that the four existing mobile operators have achieved coverage levels exceeding those set out in their current respective licences. For example, for 3G services, Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage covers 90% of the population, 5% more than its obligation.  Hutchison 3G, better known as 3, covers 96% of the population, 11% more than its obligation.  O2 also covers 90.5% of the population, which is more than its obligation.</P>
        <P>ComReg also notes that coverage continues to be an important competitive differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market.  Any deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential customers.</P>
        <P>The importance of maintaining the existing levels of mobile telephony and mobile broadband coverage has been raised with ComReg by my officials.  While the outcome of the forthcoming multi-band spectrum release process cannot be anticipated, I understand that ComReg is not expecting any reduction in coverage as a result of the process.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that ComReg&rsquo;s coverage proposals are designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a manner that would ensure that cherry picking of high density urban areas would not occur.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of whether a universal service obligation should be imposed on mobile phone service providers, I would advise that the setting of such obligations are subject to the EU Universal Service Directive.  The Directive requires the setting of a universal service obligation to provide a network connection at a fixed location and does not provide for such an obligation in respect of mobile coverage.</P>

        <Quest> the measures that are being taken to protect migrating salmon smolts being killed going to sea from hydros and fish farms causing sealice; and his plans to review dams under the responsibility of his Department. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the response I gave to the House on 1st May last on both issues.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of salmon smolts going to sea, the Electricity Supply Board operate 10 large-scale hydro-electric stations located on the Rivers Shannon, Erne, Liffey, Lee and the Clady/Crolly.</P>
        <P>ESB have advised that during the downward salmon migration to sea (March-early June), the ESB operate a salmon smolt generation protocol involving evening and early night-time generation on their Kaplan sets (the most fish-friendly type of turbine).  These turbine sets are run at near to maximum efficiency and smolt losses are minimised.  The effectiveness of these running regimes has been shown to result in survival rates of up to 92% for these stations.  The ESB operate salmon hatcheries that further mitigate the very small scale losses.</P>
        <P>Smaller hydroelectric schemes operate differently as water is selectively discharged over spillway gates or through fish passes to prevent smolt losses.  On relatively small hydroelectric plants Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) have advised that there is also a requirement to fit fine mesh screens to the intake point during the spring migration period to prevent smolts being taken into and through the turbine.  As an additional safeguard, provision is also made for spilling water over a weir so as to provide an alternative downstream route.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding &ldquo;fish farms causing sealice&rdquo;, protocols for the control of sea-lice infestation at salmon farms is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the development of fish farming in which I have no role.  I am fully supportive of sustainable aquaculture development and strongly support the ongoing efforts of the Minister, his Department and its agencies to ensure that all such activity complies with our obligations under the Habitats Directive and other EU legislation designed to protect our environment.</P>
        <P>I am liaising with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture Food and Marine with a view to progressing matters in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware from my response to his question in the house on 20 May that Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) advises that an important scientific study conducted by IFI on the impact of sea lice infestation of outwardly migrating salmon smolts from a number of rivers on Ireland&rsquo;s West Coast was published earlier this year.  I have already organised for a copy of the study to be forwarded to the Deputy and I want to reiterate that IFI scientists are available to discuss the report with the Deputy if he so wishes.</P>

        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme which delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty at no cost to the homeowner.  The measures include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. To date, the scheme has completed energy efficiency measures in over 83,000 homes.</P>
        <P>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme does not include the provision of central heating. In 2009 and 2010, as a result of increased Exchequer allocations, 825 homes received central heating and either internal or external wall insulation. However, due to a significant increase in demand for the scheme in late 2010 which continued through 2011, the SEAI has prioritised the delivery of lower cost measures in order to address the maximum number of vulnerable homes. A further 400 homes were surveyed and assessed as suitable for additional measures, of which 388 have subsequently received the standard package of energy efficiency measures. In 12 instances it has not proved technically feasible or cost effective to provide the standard measures. There are no plans to revise the scheme to include the delivery of central heating.</P>
        <P>There are currently 8,667 homes on the waiting list to receive energy efficiency measure under Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme. All new applicants since the end of 2011 have been informed that there is a change in eligibility criteria for the scheme. The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority: such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services. This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to <i>oireachtas@seai.ie</i>   and will be dealt with promptly.</P>

        <Quest> if public consultations will take place as part of the review of the eel management plan for Ireland (details supplied) in County Westmeath; if members of the eel fishing community will receive any form of compensation due to the ban on eel fishing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland&rsquo;s plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.</P>
        <P>Bye-laws, Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 303, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009, were signed by the then Minister in 2009 prohibiting the capture of eels.  There was no provision for compensation for those who previously engaged in this fishery on a commercial basis.</P>
        <P>The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland &mdash; IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.</P>
        <P>There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context, I am sure you will appreciate that in the current economic climate the Government does not have funds available to provide for compensation payments.</P>
        <P>The National EMP is currently being updated following the provision of three additional years of scientific research and monitoring of the status of eels stocks.  The latest independent Standing Scientific Committee report on eels has been posted onto Inland Fisheries Ireland&rsquo;s (IFI) website and a link to this web page is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  IFI&rsquo;s three-year eel monitoring report is also available online.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan Implementation report, which details progress on Ireland&rsquo;s 2009 Eel Management Plan, is due to be submitted to the EU shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to the information contained in these reports and prior to consideration of the continuation of existing measures, a public consultation period has commenced.  The closing date for receipt of submissions to be considered as part of the review of eel plans for Ireland was set as Monday 2nd July 2012.  However, on foot of presentations made to stakeholders as part of the consultation, I have decided to extend the closing date to 11 July to facilitate the receipt of submissions from as many stakeholders as possible. Submissions made during the public consultation period, which included a number of public meetings/seminars, will be considered in formulating proposals for the management of the eel fishery for the coming years.  Three public meetings on the eel management plans have been held during the last week, in Clonmel, County Tipperary on June 19th, in Athlone, County Westmeath on June 20th and in Carrick on Shannon, County Leitrim on June 21st.  Copies of all relevant documents (EU Report, Scientific Report and Monitoring Report) were available at the public meetings and are also available on IFI&rsquo;s website (<i>www.fisheriesireland.ie</i>) or through the link on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>).</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the poor level of broadband connectivity in an area (details supplied) in County Kilkenny and the adverse effects the lack of service has on local business; his position on developing such broadband services following a commitment to work with a range of telecom companies to ensure a nationwide roll out of fast broadband services over the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis, including county Kilkenny, can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation&rsquo;s (ComReg) website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.</P>
        <P>Prior to the roll-out of this scheme, my Department had a comprehensive mapping exercise carried out to establish which parts of the country, by virtue of the existing and planned investment by commercial operators, could be deemed to be served and those that could be categorised as un-served and consequently required a State-led market intervention.</P>
        <P>That exercise established that the area of Castlecomer was already served by at least one commercial operator and consequently the area was excluded from the NBS.</P>
        <P>The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>
        <P>With basic broadband services available throughout Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government accepts that the widespread availability of such speeds is required to deliver future economic and social development.</P>
        <P>Following the recent publication of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), and a short public consultation on its findings and recommendations, I will be bringing proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed broadband services on a national basis.</P>

The Working Group involved in running this project (comprising officials from DCENR, DES, HeaNet and the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) is currently evaluating tenders received from those companies qualified under the Framework Agreement and it is my hope that actual work on connecting the 200 schools involved in the first phase of this 3-year programme will begin this week.  It is expected that all schools in this phase of the project will have their connectivity finalised by October next.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>Under Directive 2009/28/EC, Ireland has been set a legally binding target of 16% of all energy consumption to be from renewable sources by 2020.  This target has to be achieved across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  To achieve this, we have set goals of 40% for the electricity sector, 10% for the transport sector and 12% for the heat sector, which together amount to 16% of all energy consumption overall.</P>
        <P>There are plans and processes in place to ensure that we move along the trajectory towards delivery of our target.  Ireland&rsquo;s first progress report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan was published in January 2012 and sets out where we were at the end of 2010 and how we intend to progress towards 2020.  At the end of 2010, 5.5% of all energy consumed in Ireland was from renewable sources, up from 3.1% in 2005.</P>
        <P>In the transport sector, under the biofuels obligation scheme, our intention is to increase blending of biofuels in petrol and diesel gradually in the period to 2020, in line with the fuel quality directive. This will deliver the bulk of our 2020 renewable transport target.  A small additional proportion will be delivered through increased use of electric vehicles and a grant scheme for electric vehicles was opened by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2011.</P>
        <P>In the electricity sector, which will deliver the bulk of our target, the Commission for Energy Regulation through the Gate grid connection process has ensured that sufficient grid connection offers to meet our 40% renewable electricity target have been issued.  EirGrid under its Grid 25 strategy and under its implementation plans is ensuring sufficient grid upgrade and grid build to ensure that the grid can deliver on this significant amount of new renewable generation, particularly new wind.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2011, it is currently estimated that 17.6% of our electricity consumption was from renewables.  There are a total of 152 windfarms connected to the national grid with a total installed capacity of 1,628 MW approximately.  Additionally, there is small and large hydro and biomass generation attached with approximately 1900MW of renewable generation connected to the grid in total.</P>
        <P>In addition to what is already connected to the grid, 1500MW of renewable generation has already contracted for grid connection build with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.  For the most part, these are projects from Gate 1 and Gate 2 that are still awaiting grid build-out, along with about 500MW from Gate 3. 3900MW of grid connection offers issued under Gate 3 and the full take-up rate is not yet known.</P>
        <P>The latest forecasts from the SEAI as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is 4000MW, provided we achieve our energy efficiency goals.  It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2 and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3 is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.</P>
        <P>Renewable generation is supported through REFIT which guarantees a minimum price over a 15 year period for electricity from specific renewable sources exported to the grid.  Onshore wind, hydro, landfill gas, biomass combustion, biomass co-firing, biomass combined heat and power (CHP) and anaerobic digestion are the categories of technology which are eligible for REFIT.</P>
        <P>The heat sector is indirectly supported through REFIT in the CHP category.  Additionally, there are grants available for certain bioenergy crops.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 356 together.</P>
        <P>Exploration licences are valid from the date of issue and are granted on the basis of the performance of a work programme by the licence holders.  Exploration activity related to the agreed work programmes for each of the exploration licences issued in the last three years is ongoing.  In the event of a commercial discovery arising from petroleum exploration licences awarded since 1 January 2007, the State would benefit from a tax on profits of between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.  A commercial discovery would also help strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s energy security of supply and have a positive impact on Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to attract an increased share of international exploration investment.</P>
        <P>There are 18 petroleum exploration licences at present and while there have been a number of discoveries of oil and gas in recent years, none have been declared commercial to date.  The only petroleum discovery that has been declared commercial but has yet to come into production is the Corrib Gas Field. With regard to non-petroleum minerals as of 21st   June 2012, there are 592 mineral prospecting licences currently held by 45 companies.  Once issued, all licences are active.</P>
        <P>While no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in the past three years, there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare.  However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue. Details of all exploration licences can be found in the six-monthly reports to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the Houses under the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act 1960 and Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999 respectively.  The last such reports are in respect of the six-month period ending 31 December 2011.  These reports are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at:</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the extent to which he or his Department directly or through the medium of the Regulator have monitored the developments in An Post post de-regulation with particular reference to the need to ensure the continued provision of countrywide next day delivery of letter and parcel services supported by the countrywide network of post offices and sub-post offices involving enhanced and modernised counter services and ensuring that cherry-picking is not allowed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which was enacted in August 2011, has put in place a robust and appropriate regulatory framework for the postal services market.</P>
        <P>While I have overall responsibility for the postal sector, the Act charges the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as the postal regulator, with the promotion of the development of the postal sector, particularly the availability of the universal postal service, the promotion of the interests of users and the facilitation of the development of competition in the sector.  ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.</P>
        <P>Under the 2011 Act, An Post is statutorily required, as the designated universal service provider, to provide a universal postal service.  The essential element of this obligation is the collection and delivery of mail to every address in the State on every working day.  The universal service obligation is a form of safety net, ensuring by way of regulatory obligations that a minimum set of services is provided at an affordable price for the benefit of all users, irrespective of their geographical location.  It is a fundamental principle of the regulatory framework for postal services and is an explicit requirement of the EU Postal Services Directive which has provided for the gradual and controlled opening of the postal services market to competition. The Deputy may wish to note that the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act of 2011 also makes provision for a compensation mechanism, to be met by the postal industry, if it is found that the universal service obligation is an unfair burden on the designated universal service provider.</P>

        <P>Completion of the Corrib gas field development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.</P>
        <P>The developer is in receipt of all statutory permits relevant to the construction of the Corrib gas pipeline.  Works commenced in July 2011 and oversight of these works is being undertaken by the appropriate authorities with respect to their respective consents i.e. Mayo County Council is charged with enforcement and compliance with the conditions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s development permission pursuant to the Planning and Development Acts, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government monitors compliance with the Foreshore Licence and my Department oversees and ensures statutory compliance with regard to the permissions granted pursuant to the Gas and Petroleum Acts. It is estimated that construction of the onshore section of the pipeline, including the construction of a 5km tunnel, which began last year, will take in the region of three years.  First gas cannot therefore reasonably be anticipated before 2014.</P>

        <P>I have no statutory function in relation to energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated energy markets.  Energy policy objectives for Ireland and the European Union are delivering security of supply and reducing the impact of energy costs for consumers and business, through the development of renewable energy resources, enhanced energy efficiency and greater competition.  National and EU energy policy objectives are also informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply.  The Government&rsquo;s energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes including the Biofuels Obligation are aimed at moving Ireland&rsquo;s economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility.</P>
        <P>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.  Previous surveys have shown that prices, which Irish retailers charge for oil products, relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, which is fluctuating, transportation costs, euro/dollar exchange rate fluctuations and other operating costs as well as the impact of taxes on oil products.</P>

        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advise that renewable/alternative energy electricity generation contributed 17.6% of the gross final consumption of electricity in 2011.  17.6% of gross final consumption represents over 5,000 GWh of electricity in the Irish market in 2011.  The latest analysis from the SEAI shows that these alternative energy sources replaced over 12,000 GWh of electricity which otherwise would have been generated by conventional fuel.  This resulted in 21% less overall natural gas imports in 2011 (or 28% less gas for electricity generation) and 0.3% less oil imports than would have been required if renewable energy sources were not deployed.  This would equate to approximately &euro;300 million each year in avoided imports of fossil fuels.</P>

Planning applications are decided under planning legislation on an individual basis by each planning authority and details regarding number and type of projects awaiting planning permission are available from individual planning authorities.</P>
        <P>In order to connect to the electricity grid, generators require a grid connection offer.  Supervision of the grid connection process, including access to offers, is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The Gate process was put in place by the CER following public consultation.  It is a group processing approach (GPA) towards the processing and issuance of grid connection offers to renewable generators.</P>
        <P>To date there have been 3 Gates.  Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted.  Under Gate 3, 3900MW of offers have issued to renewable generators.  In addition to the 1900MW of renewable generation already connected to the grid, 1500MW of renewable generation has already contracted for grid connection build with either EirGrid or ESB Networks.  For the most part, these are projects from Gate 1 and Gate 2 that are still awaiting grid build-out, along with about 500MW from Gate 3.  Indicative timelines for the connection of those who have contracted are available on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites.</P>
        <P>The latest forecasts from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) as to the amount of renewable generation required to meet our 40% renewable electricity target is 4000MW, provided we achieve our energy efficiency goals.  It is expected that between what is already built in Gate 1 and Gate 2 and what has already contracted to build along with the remainder of Gate 3 is largely sufficient for the achievement of our 40% target, even if some Gate 3 developers ultimately decide not to accept their offer.  In order to be accepted into the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff scheme (REFIT), administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, applicants must have both a grid connection offer and planning permission.</P>

        <P>The Building Control Act 1990 clearly places responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder/developer who carries out the works.  The Building Regulations set out the legally enforceable minimum standards which a new building must achieve.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the 37 local Building Control Authorities who have strong powers to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance or to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements within a period of five years from the date the building has been completed.  Homeowners should be advised to report any concerns about non-compliance with the Building Regulations to the Building Control Authority in the Local Authority responsible for the area in which they live.</P>
        <P>It may be the case that the builder/developer who built their home was a member of a structural guarantee warranty/scheme, such as that provided by HomeBond, or subject to other insurance cover.  This should be ascertained and pursued where relevant.  Remediation of defects is a matter between the parties concerned, the owner and the builder/developer and their insurers. If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered.</P>

        <P>For the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland is committed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels over the 2008-2012 period. In accordance with the National Climate Change Strategy, that target will be met on foot of domestic mitigation action supplemented by the purchase of carbon allowances or credits under the flexible mechanisms provided for in the Protocol.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas mitigation target for 2020 requires a 20% reduction on 2005 levels in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS).  This reduction must be achieved along a legally-binding trajectory, beginning in 2013 at the average emissions for 2008-2010, with annual targets up to 2020. This poses a very significant challenge and, even under the most optimistic scenario, a compliance gap will need to be bridged.  This gap will be addressed through domestic policy development complemented, as necessary, by use of the flexibilities provided in Decision 406/2009/EC of 23 April 2009.  Irish installations participating in the EU-ETS will operate within an EU-wide cap which will deliver a 21% reduction on 2005 levels by 2020.</P>
        <P>The programme for climate policy and legislation published 23 January 2012 set out my approach to the development of national policy and legislation over an 18 month period.  The principal milestones include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />a public consultation (which ran from 29 February to 1 April 2012);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />in the second half of this year, the publication of an initial report by the NESC Secretariat on potential climate polices and measures, and the development of heads of a Climate Bill for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht following Government approval; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />consideration of the final report by the NESC Secretariat and the heads of the Bill by the Committee in the first half of 2013.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I indicated in the programme for climate policy and legislation, I will publish the Heads of a Climate Bill in the fourth quarter of 2012.</P>
        <P>In my presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on 15 December 2011, I set out my approach to ensuring that we develop the necessary policy mix to support an ambitious but realistic national direction towards a low-carbon future.  The green economy and sustainable development agendas are key elements of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery strategy.  They can provide the opportunities for job creation in start-up and scale-up companies, with increased public demand for green goods and services in both domestic and international markets.  Earlier this month, I published Our Sustainable Future, a Framework for Sustainable Development for Ireland, which sets out a medium to long-term approach to guide the essential work required to progress the sustainable development agenda and more fully embrace the green economy in Ireland.   The agenda in this area will be progressed further through the development of a Green Economy Action Plan under the Jobs Action Plan, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 376 together.</P>
        <P>Premises involved in the treatment of animal by-products are subject to an approval process overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The primary purpose of the waste facility permitting and registration system is to facilitate appropriate controls on waste facilities and activities so as to ensure good and consistent waste management practice and the implementation of high standards of environmental protection.  The waste and animal by-products statutory permitting mechanisms are distinct processes with no formal sequencing.  This reflects the fact that a waste permit or licence may allow several activities, some of which may not be relevant to the treatment of animal by-products.  I understand that it can be preferable from the waste facility operator&rsquo;s perspective that such a distinction exists, as, for example, an operator may wish to phase the introduction of different waste treatment operations.</P>
        <P>Under the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations 2007, a local authority is required to engage with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a number of circumstances.  These requirements include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />When a local authority considers that a valid waste facility permit application has been received, and where the application is concerned with the composting of animal by-products, the local authority is required to notify the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine within 5 working days,  and include a copy of the application.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />When a waste facility permit is issued which involves the biological treatment of animal by-products, the local authority is required to notify the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and include a copy of the permit.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A local authority, when making a clerical or technical amendment to a waste facility permit, is required to notify particulars of the amendment involved to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a case where the waste facility permit is concerned with the treatment of animal by-products.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Where a waste facility permit which involves the treatment of animal by-products has been reviewed, the local authority concerned is required to notify the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and include a copy of the reviewed permit.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />In the case of an activity involving the biological treatment of animal by-products and where a certificate of registration has been granted, refused, revoked or surrendered, the local authority is required to notify the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of such a decision.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, an application for a waste facility permit is required to contain, in the case of an application which involves the biological treatment of animal by-products, details of any application made to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a veterinary authorisation for the facility.</P>
        <P>As specified in the 2007 Regulations, composting facilities are also subject to a number of other regulatory requirements, including under the European Communities (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies and Animal By-Products) Regulations 2008 and the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies) (Fertilizers and Soil Improvers) Order 2008.  Queries concerning the instances in which waste facilities are permitted to treat animal by-products should be directed to individual regulating authorities, that is the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities.  I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also maintains a database of approved premises and registered hauliers; this database is available for inspection on that Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>Galway County Council has written to my Department seeking consent to construct facilities related to the Clifden Sewerage Scheme on lands which were created by the reclamation of an area of foreshore.  My Department has established that ownership of the lands in question was transferred from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Communications in 1981.  The Minister for Communications subsequently leased the lands to Galway County Council in 1985 under Section 10(2) of the State Property Act, 1954.</P>

Clarity is required on the current ownership of the lands concerned in order to establish which Minister is the consenting authority in respect of the application by the Council.

Under the new arrangements a household need only apply to one housing authority for the purpose of determining whether or not they have a housing need.  A household may thus apply to a housing authority in one functional area and be on the waiting list in another local authority area, without having a local connection.  This applies to the joint city and county areas and to town councils within a county area.  A housing authority may also decide at its discretion to accept a household who does not meet the residence or local connection criteria.</P>
        <P>With regard to local connection to an area, under the Regulations this can be established if the applicant or a member of the household;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> has lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period previously;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> has a relative living in the area for 2 years or longer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P el="0">A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  The Housing Agency&rsquo;s Housing Needs Assessment  2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide.  These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  However, as the Housing Needs Assessment only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority, it was decided in September 2011 that details on the extent of homelessness in the Dublin region, where numbers are most pronounced, would be reviewed and updated using the now fully operational Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS) and crosschecked against each of the Dublin local authorities housing management data systems to give an accurate figure of the known homeless population in Dublin.  Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons.  PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions.  It is intended that the PASS system will be operational across the entire country by end 2012.  The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.</P>
        <P>The current homeless strategy The Way Home &mdash; A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness 2008-2013   sets out Government policy on tackling homelessness and has a number of key aims including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />preventing homelessness;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />eliminating the need to sleep rough;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />eliminating long-term occupation of emergency accommodation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />providing long-term accommodation solutions;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring effective services; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />better co-ordinated funding arrangements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Programme for Government   committed to reviewing the national homelessness strategy and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  The draft of the review is being considered by my Department and was presented recently to the Cross Departmental Team on Homelessness and the Homeless Consultative Committee for consultation.  The review will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</P>
        <P>There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply for the homeless, and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches.  The initial emphasis is necessarily on the Dublin region, where there is a concentration of those accessing homelessness services, by moving away from the current over reliance on emergency accommodation provision to a more permanent accommodation solution to be achieved through a number of measures including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />directly linking the provision of funding with specific targets and outcomes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />making better use of the existing available accommodation units in the local authorities and in the voluntary sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />additional social housing provision through acquisitions and remedial works/upgrading of vacant local authority housing stock and a leasing programme;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />ongoing engagement with NAMA to secure properties;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />targeted use of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />an enhanced role for the private rental sector;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />better co-ordination with the voluntary and cooperative housing sector; and</P>

        <P>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The Valuation Office is within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  With regard to the application of rates on child care premises and cr&egrave;ches, local authorities levy rates on commercial establishments.  It is my understanding that where child care provision is within a community facility, operating in a non-profit capacity, commercial rates do not generally apply.  In all other cases, pre-school services continue to be liable to commercial rates.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</P>

        <P>The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority for the available capital funds.  Correspondence has been received in my Department from Cavan County Council in relation to proposals for works at Ballyjamesduff and Virginia fire stations, and these are currently under consideration. Further investment to support the redevelopment of these fire stations will be considered under future capital programmes, within the constraints of reduced public finances, and will have regard to the priorities of Cavan County Council, the value-for-money offered by proposals, the level of investment to date and the totality of demands from fire authorities countrywide for the limited funding available.   </P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 to 384, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Income from the Environment Fund is used to support a range of environmental measures including within the area of waste management and the enforcement of waste management legislation.  The 2011 and 2012 Environment Fund Accounts will be published in due course once they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, provisional figures (on an accruals basis) indicate that income of &euro;62,147,730 was received in 2011 from the environmental levies on the landfilling of waste and the provision of plastic bags.  Cash receipts of &euro;28,039,386 have been received for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 May 2012.  The breakdown of Environment Fund expenditure (on an accruals basis) on the waste management capital grant scheme in 2010 is set out in the table that follows this reply.  The funding was provided to support the development of local authority recycling facilities.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 595 of 6 June, 2012, the reason the legislation was originally drafted to specifically levy the household charge on property owners only, in view of the fact that the charge is for the provision of local services which are also enjoyed by both private and public tenants; if he will also comment on the fact that letting agreements generally contain a clause giving owners of private residential property the power to pass on such local government charges to their tenants, in the view of his specific comment that tenants are not liable; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

As previously outlined, section 2(2) of the Local Government (Household Change) Act 2011 provides that certain buildings are not residential property for the purposes of the legislation.  Section 2(2)(<i>b</i>), in particular, provides that a building vested in a Minister of the Government, a housing authority (within the meaning of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992) or the Health Service Executive is not a residential property for the purposes of the Act.</P>

        <P>There are nine persons in my Department available for redeployment. Six have already been redeployed to other Departments. The maximum time a person has been awaiting redeployment has been fifteen months and this arises due to the particular business specialty of the persons concerned.</P>
        <P>In relation to the state agencies under the aegis of my Department thirty four people are available for redeployment with 28 deployed already.  The maximum waiting time for this sector is 12 months and again this is due to the specific nature of their business specialty.</P>

        <P>The primary role of my Department in electoral matters is to provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for a modern and efficient electoral system.  Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.  Accordingly, there is no information in my Department about the staff employed at the recent referendum and I have no proposals to collate information in that regard.</P>
        <P>To assist returning officers, my Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum. The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 411 together.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.</P>
        <P>Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have exhibited admirable forbearance over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</P>
        <P>To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &mdash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &mdash; my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.</P>
        <P>In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.   I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.  I anticipate that this updated guidance will issue very shortly.</P>

        <P>My Department is responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  Both Local Development Companies (LDCs) referred to in the Question are funded under this Programme.</P>
        <P>In terms of future approaches, the Programme for Government provides for a review of the delivery of local and community development functions by exploring options to improve the alignment of these functions with those of local government. Accordingly, I am keen to identify opportunities to enhance the alignment between local government and the local and community development programmes that my Department implements.</P>
        <P>There is a range of proposals currently being considered with implications for both the local government and local development sectors, arising, inter alia, from the work of the Steering Group that I established on the alignment of local government and local development.  In the context of on-going work on the reform of local government, I am considering the key findings and recommendations of the Steering Group, with a view to determining the future development  arrangements which will deliver the greatest benefits for the citizen.  Building on the range of reforms already underway, I intend to bring policy proposals to Government in the near future.</P>
        <P>With regard to the two areas referred to in the Question, my Department has recently commenced a process of engagement with the stakeholders to develop a plan to achieve greater efficiencies and to protect, insofar as possible, front-line services and supports, through e.g. merger/rationalisation, or otherwise, with a view to establishing a single structure for LCDP delivery for the two areas in question.   That structure should operate within the South Dublin County Council boundary.  Deliberations are at a very early stage.</P>
        <P>The 2012 allocation for the LCDP is &euro;54.884 million.

        <P>Under Section 78 of the Local Government Act 2001, the provision of premises and facilities in the public library service is a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a library authority.</P>
        <P>My Department provides capital funding towards the provision and refurbishment of new and existing public libraries. In this regard, in 2008 my Department requested library authorities to provide details of priorities for library development within its area.</P>
        <P>In its response, Longford County Council ranked Ballymahon branch library as its main priority, followed by projects at Granard and Edgeworthstown and the provision of a library delivery vehicle.</P>
        <P>Grant aid of &euro;900,000 was approved and drawn down in respect of the Ballymahon project with the final payment being made in October, 2011.

        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector. The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.  <b> </b></P>
        <P>My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced in April 2010 and the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011 was approved by Government in July 2011. The Bill is currently in preparation by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in collaboration with my Department with a view to early publication.</P>
        <P>The Bill will,<i> inter alia</i>, extend the remit of the Act and of the Board to the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and will give legal effect to the administrative merger of the Rent Tribunal and the PRTB.</P>
        <P>Private rented dwellings must, by law, be registered with the PRTB within one month after the commencement of the tenancy and the cost of registration is &euro;90 for a single tenancy. Where the tenancy is registered more than one month after the commencement of the tenancy an additional late fee of &euro;90 is payable.  The same late fee is payable regardless how late the registration is received by the PRTB.</P>

        <P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at &euro;200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.  Application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Where a property is liable and the charge is not paid by the due date, the legislation provides at section 6 for late fees and penalties to be applied, which remain a charge on the property and continue to accrue until the liability is discharged.  There is no provision in the Act for fees and penalties to be waived.</P>
        <P>However, I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the legislation in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  The guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in relation to entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  Enquiries in this regard should be directed to the relevant local authority.</P>

Accordingly, I am keen to identify opportunities to enhance the alignment between local government and the local and community development programmes that my Department implements.</P>
        <P>There is a range of proposals currently being considered with implications for both the local government and local development sectors, arising, inter alia, from the work of the Steering Group that I established on the alignment of local government and local development.  In the context of on-going work on the reform of local government, I am considering the key findings and recommendations of the Steering Group, with a view to determining the future development  arrangements which will deliver the greatest benefits for the citizen.

The making and amending of these rent schemes are an integral part of a housing authority&rsquo;s housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 of 6 March 2002 under Section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 (as amended).  It is a matter for each housing authority to manage information given to tenants in an appropriate and efficient manner.  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 will replace, once commenced, existing provisions in relation to differential rent schemes.  Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities in relation to differential rent are currently in preparation in my Department.  While it is not the intention to implement a national standardised differential rent scheme, the proposed regulations will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including procedures for rent reviews.</P>

        <P>My Department is responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  </P>
        <P>The LCDP superseded the Community Development Programme and the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme in January 2010.  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The Programme is managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies (LDCs).  Funding of some &euro;55m has been provided under the Programme for 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that the Local Development Company (LDC) based in Galway &mdash; Galway City Partnership &mdash; provided support to the start-up process for the group referred to in the Question, and currently, has the lead role in the operation and management of an information, advocacy and support service to migrants and their families in Galway City through the conduit of the LCDP.  Funding for this service has been sourced from the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s European Integration Fund (&euro;114,078 in 2012), with Galway City Council providing &euro;10,000 support.</P>
        <P>The LDC may also be able to offer some small-scale support in 2012 in the context of a facilitative and advocacy role, through minor grant support, if requested, subject to the activity fitting within the LCDP programme framework.  The LDC, in addition, is the lead agency of the Migrants Service Project, which is European Integration funded.  If any aspect of this service can be of benefit to Galway Refugee Support Group, it will be made available.  All funding applications would have to be considered by the Board of the LDC, and, therefore, the group should contact the Company directly regarding any potential future funding.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Abuja, Nigeria on 10th April 2012.  Following full consideration the visa officer decided to refuse the grant of the visa for the following reasons.  </P>
        <P>The applicant was seeking to join a person who has been granted &ldquo;Temporary Leave to Remain&rdquo; in the State.  Persons granted such permission are informed in writing that one of the conditions of accepting the permission is that it does not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to them or not, to enter or remain in the State.  In this case no compelling grounds have been shown as to why an exception to this policy should be made.</P>
        <P>In addition, no evidence was shown of a relationship being in existence prior to the visa application.  A full account of relationship history including details of all time spent together with evidence such as immigration stamps, photos, evidence of cohabitation and evidence of ongoing contact and financial support should accompany this type of visa application.</P>
        <P>As is the case with all refused visa applications, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision were sent by way of letter to the applicant.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision of the Visa Officer within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before 2nd July, 2012.  Guidelines on the appeals process can be found on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

        <P>The Programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges</i>&rdquo; and this commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  </P>
        <P>In November 2011, the then recently appointed Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, announced that the judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  The taking of this important, forward-looking initiative by the judiciary has been widely welcomed.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012 and are the subject of ongoing consideration and consultation taking account of intervening developments and current Government policy.  This continuing work will inform the framing and drafting of the new Bill including in conjunction with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.  Beyond this, the situation remains as under the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme announced by the Chief Whip on 17 April 2012, namely, that the Judicial Council Bill is in the course of being drafted with a view to being published late in 2012.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s procurements operate within the legal framework of EU procurement directives and the guidance of the Department of Finance for procurements under EU thresholds &mdash; as required, all tenders over &euro;25,000 are publicly advertised either on etenders or in the EU Journal. </P>
        <P>As part of its procurement controls my Department has had in place a database for all contracts placed over &euro;25,000 for the last number of years.  It also has records of contracts placed earlier than 2009 and still in place during the period under question.  However, my Department considers this database to be a representative source for the purposes of the question as it covers contracts within and outside the scope of the EU Journal, including contracts over &euro;100,000 in value.</P>
        <P>An examination of the records in this database which covers all expenditure above &euro;100,000 for the period in question allowed an assessment to be made of contracts as follows, reflecting changing compliance thresholds at both National and EU levels:</P>
        <P LI="1">a. Contracts valued between &euro;25,000 and &euro;124,999;</P>
        <P LI="1">b. Contracts valued between &euro;50,000 and &euro;124,999;</P>
        <P LI="1">c. Contracts valued over &euro;125,000.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is no formal categorisation of the specific award criteria in each instance and the response below represents a best estimate in the time allowed of the number of contracts recorded in the Database that have been awarded, at a value of more than &euro;100,000 in each of the past three years by my Department, where in the scoring mechanism at least 50% of the award criteria was on the basis of cost.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that in the matter of all publicly held competitive tender exercises, the Award Criteria used by the Department for the evaluation of proposals is &ldquo;The Most Economically Advantageous Tender&rdquo;.  The majority of contracts awarded on foot  of supplementary tenders run from Framework Agreements, are evaluated by means of 100% Lowest Cost as the Award Criterion, though not exclusively.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division in February, 2006 and my predecessor decided to refuse the application. The person concerned was informed of this and the reasons for it in a letter issued on 10th December, 2009 &mdash; over two and half years ago. While there is no provision under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended for appeal in relation to an application for a certificate of naturalisation, it is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if they consider they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that on 19 June 2012 I published a report on the criminal justice aspects of the cash for gold trade which was prepared by my Department. I have stated that while the relevant criminal justice law is adequate to deal with the transactions in question, it is arguably inconsistent that there are rules and regulations that apply to pawnbrokers for the protection of the public and that similar rules do not apply to cash for gold outlets.  I have formally requested the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to consider the content of the report, that it considers holding hearings on the issues raised in the report, that it obtains the views of all relevant interested parties and that it makes such report and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Government as it deems proportionate and appropriate in the public interest.</P>

        <P>To date, I understand that my Department has placed 12 posts in the redeployment pool operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  I am also advised that other areas in the Justice Vote Group and Agencies under the aegis of the Department, for which I have information to hand, have not placed any posts in the same pool.  I would draw the Deputies&rsquo; attention to the fact that it is posts rather than persons that Departments and Agencies place in the pool and therefore the situation of a maximum time for a person does not arise.  The Deputies will be aware that my Department and the Vote Group generally is subject to the Employment Control Framework for the public service and available actions, including the opportunities afforded by redeployment, are being used to ensure compliance with the limits that the Framework imposes.</P>

        <P>My Department has been open to accept applications under the The Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme since 16 April of this year.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service have informed me that, to date, five applications have been lodged for the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme, which are being examined as part of the evaluation process outlined in the published guidelines.  At this early stage therefore no applications have been approved or rejected.  Nevertheless this early interest is encouraging as it was envisaged that applicants would require quite some time to put together their applications and supporting business plans.  To date no formal applications have been received from investors but I understand that there continues to be a significant number of enquiries from potential participants and their representatives.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to focus on high risk behaviour such as speeding, drink or drug driving, non-use of seatbelts, reckless driving, use of mobile phones while driving and on identified vulnerable road users, including learner drivers. In that regard, the Deputy will be also be aware that the Garda authorities conducted two specific enforcement operations targeting learner drivers, in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority and other relevant stakeholders, this year on 1/2  March and 19 April 2012. A substantial number of cautions and proceedings arose as a result of these targeted initiatives.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to prioritise the enforcement of road traffic legislation to ensure greater compliance by learner drivers.</P>

        <P>The disposition of staff in my Department is a matter for the Secretary General and is executed through the Human Resources Division. </P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that my Department, in similar fashion to other Departments, as part of its planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, will be assigning staff to Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation in Brussels later this year. Five staff in the grades referenced by the Deputy have been selected and will be assigned, these are: 1 Clerical Officer; 1 Executive Officer; 1 Higher Executive Officer and 2 Administrative Officers. (It was open to Higher Executive Officers or Administrative Officers to apply for the posts.)</P>
        <P>My Department did not ask applicants to advise their age when applying for possible assignment. The Deputy should be aware that as age had no relevance to the selection process, an applicant&rsquo;s age was not established in the processing of their application nor included in the information provided to the selection board.  Indeed, to have done so would have been inappropriate.  Consequently, I am advised that the age breakdowns sought by the Deputy are not readily available without a significant amount of work to interrogate each individual officer&rsquo;s file and even then it is unclear what interest would be served in establishing the said information. In addition, I am unclear as to what relevance the age of 35 has as a possible threshold, were age of itself to be meaningful.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department is committed to policies conducive to promoting equal opportunities for all its staff regardless of their age.  My Department conducted this selection process in an open fashion, first seeking preliminary expressions of interest from relevant staff and then subsequently inviting those staff to submit formal applications.  The requirements on applicants and the selection processes themselves were set out clearly in all communications to staff.</P>
        <P>All HEOs/AOs who applied were called for interview. In regard to shortlisting, this was applied to the Executive Officer and Clerical Officer grades given the number of applications received.  The criteria used were as set out below :</P>

        <P FLI="0">My colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will shortly make recommendations arising from a review of allowances payable to civil and public servants.  Any allowances payable to the staff being assigned to the Permanent Representation Brussels will have regard to those recommendations.  However, I am advised that it is expected to pay an allowance to officers in respect of rental of accommodation and in the way of foreign service allowances as currently arise. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is in the nature of all selection processes, that there will be disappointed applicants at its conclusion.  I am advised that no formal complaints have been submitted in respect of the process referenced by the Deputy, although some disappointed applicants did make enquiries.  Should any applicant wish to raise concerns regarding any decision this can be done via the Human Resources Division of my Department.  Should any applicant wish to avail of feedback this too can be facilitated in a similar fashion.  I am advised that feedback including one to one meetings has been provided to a number of applicants.</P>

        <P>The moratorium on recruitment remains in place, as the objective set out in agreement with the EU and the IMF, is to reduce the numbers of public servants. What will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force. The Government are conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.<b> </b></P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there is a Garda recruitment panel currently in place consisting of applicants selected by the Public Appointments Service as part of a 2008 recruitment campaign.  However, no offers of employment have been made to applicants since the introduction of the public service moratorium on recruitment in 2009. Given that the current panel is in existence since 2008, the lifetime of the panel, and the position of applicants on it, is being kept under review in the light of when Garda recruitment might recommence.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Under the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation of the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.</P>
        <P LI="1">Regrettably, there are an increasing number of cases in our society that involve suicide and that fall to be investigated by our coroners. Coroners must ensure that a proper public investigation be seen to take place in order to reassure the public as to the cause of death in all cases of reportable death. I am aware that it is the practice of our coroners to be especially sensitive in so far as is possible, to the needs of families in the handling of all inquests and particularly so where suicide may be in question. I am aware of the hurt and trauma involved for family members and relatives in all tragic death situations, but perhaps especially in regard to suicide.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have no plans to amend the law to exclude the public from an inquest which may be investigating a death resulting from suicide.&rdquo;</P>

        <P>Tackling organised crime including drug dealing remains a key ongoing priority both for the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Policing Plan of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2012 sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised crime activities.  In targeting serious and organised crime, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.</P>
        <P>Multi-agency approaches have been, and continue to be, used whereby all of the National Units from National Support Services including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau, along with the Criminal Assets Bureau, are used to combat serious crime including those involved in the trafficking, importation, sale and supply of illegal drugs. These Units are supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and timely information. These operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure effectiveness and are deployed in conjunction with the responsibility on all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tasked with implementing and enforcing the criminal law.</P>
        <P>In line with the National Policing Plan, the Garda National Drugs Unit continues to lead the Policing Strategy for Tackling Drugs by Demand Reduction and Supply Reduction strategies. The Garda National Drugs Unit continues to work with Divisional and District Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  A strategic partnership has also been established between the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau in identifying common targets who are then pursued through intelligence-led investigations.  In addition, with regard to preventing drug use, the Garda National Drugs Unit actively works with other statutory, community and voluntary bodies and represents An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the relevant fora established under the National Drugs Strategy.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works collaboratively with law enforcement agencies throughout the world including through Interpol, Europol and Garda Liaison Officers based in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also works closely with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Branch), the Police Service of Northern Ireland and HM Revenue and Customs in targeting the activities of organised crime gangs suspected of involvement in the importation, sale, supply and distribution of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the further development of the legislative framework in this area, the Deputy will be aware that I have indicated to the House that I will keep under review the criminal law targeting organised crime, primarily that introduced under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. In addition, under the auspices of my Department a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation is underway with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 460 of 12 June 2012, if the advertisement for the visa office posts in April 2010 expressly stated that the staff members had to hold Irish citizenship and if not, the reason for same; the reason non Irish citizen staff members are unable to take up these posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>I am advised that the relevant Office Notice circulated in April 2010 did not state that the staff members had to hold Irish citizenship in order to apply.  It has, however, been the practice that staff posted abroad, as advised in my earlier reply to which the Deputy refers, are expected to hold Irish citizenship in order to take up that posting.  Where staff cannot satisfy this requirement it is not possible to assign them to such a posting.  This, I understand, has been a long and established practice. Whilst it is not essential, as a matter of general practice, staff of this Department of whatever grade serving in missions abroad must be capable of being accredited to the country in which they are posted. Accreditation can only be requested for, and therefore afforded to, Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in the context of the work undertaken by the officers who serve abroad representing this country and making important decisions, in these instances, on visa applications, I consider it entirely appropriate and reasonable that the staff concerned be Irish citizens.  However, I am advised by my Department that it regrets that the previous Office Notice to which the Deputy has referred did not make the citizenship requirement explicit and so as to avoid any doubts into the future will ensure that all future similar Notices make the requirement clear.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the D&aacute;il prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the Bill will introduce a number of new non-judicial debt settlement systems. Two of the proposed arrangements &mdash; Debt Settlement Arrangement and the Personal Insolvency Arrangement &mdash; require the involvement of a Personal Insolvency Trustee to essentially act as an intermediary between the debtor and his or her creditors. The precise details in regard to the appointment and regulation of such trustees are likely to require further consideration in the final development of the Bill in consultation with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and professional bodies.</P>

I am further informed that the introduction of the lower limits for breath alcohol in October 2011, as provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2010 (as amended), necessitated the replacement of existing evidential breath testing instruments in Garda stations. In advance of the introduction, 64 evidential breath testing instruments were allocated by the MBRS to Garda stations nationwide. The Garda authorities and MBRS trained Garda personnel from the 64 Garda stations as supervisors and operators of the new instruments.</P>
        <P>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have requested an additional 22 intoxilyser devices from the MBRS. In that regard, the MBRS has indicated that the purchase and installation of the devices has been approved. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the MBRS are preparing an implementation plan for the installation of the additional evidential breath testing equipment and for the training of sufficient Garda personnel.

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in that matter. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>There are currently 64 evidential breath-testing machines allocated by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to Garda stations nationwide and it is proposed to increase this with an additional 22 in the near future. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has statutory responsibility for the testing, approval and supply of roadside breath screening devices to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Training has been and will continue to be provided to the operators of these devices so that a full service can be provided on this particular issue.</P>

        <P>The number of staff who retired from my Department and from agencies under the auspices of my Department in each year since 1 January 2009 up to 26th June 2012 is set out in Table 1.  For the most part the cost of lump sum gratuity payments in respect of staff who retire from my Department and from agencies in the Justice Sector are paid from the Superannuation and Allowances Vote of the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Vote 12).  However, the most significant exception to this is in relation to lump sum gratuities to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which are paid from the Garda Vote.  Details of the number of retirements and the cost of lump sum gratuity payments in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for each year since 2009 are set out in Table 2.</P>

        <P>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.  The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.  The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.  I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.</P>

        <P>The Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunity, in all employment policies, procedures and regulations. The Defence Forces operate in an environment which is free from discrimination as provided for by the Equality Acts. However, the Defence Forces have a derogation from the provisions of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 to 2011 in respect of criteria of disability and age. Accordingly, recruitment criteria based on physiological and age requirements are permitted by legislation. Similar derogations apply to the Garda Sioch&aacute;na and the Prison Service.</P>
        <P>Psychometric Testing is carried out as part of the recruitment process for appointment as a Cadet and enlistment as a General Service Recruit in the Defence Forces. Testing is conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) on behalf of the Defence Forces. The PAS makes provision for candidates with dyslexia or other learning difficulties. Such candidates are given additional time (one sixth of stipulated time) to answer questions. Prior to presenting for tests, candidates wishing to avail of this provision are required to contact the PAS and forward supporting documentation in the form of medical and psychological reports.  However, there is no provision made for a reader during these tests as the current age, medical and physical requirements for entry into the Permanent Defence Force reflect the fact that only recruits who are free from disability, including the ability to read unassisted, can satisfy the difficult demands of the training and operational environment in which all recruits must operate.</P>

The bulk of the payments arose as a result of the closure of military barracks.  The redundancies represent a permanent reduction in staff numbers and ongoing savings in pay costs and as such, are reported under the Croke Park Agreement.</P>

        <P>In the past, MTL staff benefited from national pay awards for private sector workers negotiated in the context of National Agreements and their pay scales were benchmarked with comparators in the Dairy industry sector. Therefore, benchmarking, as operated in the public sector, did not apply to staff in MTL. </P>
        <P>The position of MTL staff changed in 2009 with the introduction of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act, 2009.  MTL is deemed under this legislation to be a &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; by virtue of the fact that they have a public service pension scheme and is, therefore, statutorily prohibited from increasing pay rates.</P>
        <P>MTL has been advised that no pay increases will be approved in line with current public service pay policy and having regard to the explicit provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009. The impact on the financial position of MTL and the future cost on public sector pensions is also relevant.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 and 464 together.</P>
        <P>Animal by-products (ABP) are defined as entire bodies or parts of animals, products of animal origin or other products obtained from animals which are not intended for human consumption. This definition encompasses catering waste and former foodstuffs.</P>
        <P>Because of the associated risk and to protect both human and animal health, the use of ABP is covered by comprehensive EU Regulations (Nos. 1069 of 2009 and 142 of 2011). These regulations ensure that ABP is disposed of safely and that controls are implemented to ensure this material is not illegally diverted back into the human food chain.</P>
        <P>Whether or not &lsquo;organic fines&rsquo; are regarded as ABP is a question of fact i.e. whether or not they include material which falls within the definition as set out above. If such material contains ABP then that material must be processed or disposed of in accordance with the options set out in the regulations.  The onus for determining if such material contains ABP lies with the operator who generates the material.  The regulations also place an obligation on the user of any ABP material to ensure that the product is dealt with in accordance with the regulations.</P>
        <P>Under Article 24(<i>g</i>) of ABP Regulation (EC) 1069 of 2009 any plant or establishment involved in the transformation of ABP and/or products derived from ABPs into biogas or compost must be approved by the competent authority, in this case my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department does not comment publicly on its dealings with individual business operators. The names of those approved to handle ABPs are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 504/2008 sets out an improved system for the identification for equidae and is binding on all Member States of the European Union. All approved studbooks are required to record data in accordance with the provisions set down in European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 504/2008. </P>
        <P>In January of this year I signed the Diseases of Animals Act 1988 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012, S.I. No. 8 of 2012. This legislation requires that owners or persons in charge of premises where equines (horses/mules/ponies etc.) are kept must register their location with my Department. Registered persons must keep records of the equines on the premises and the movement of equines off and on to the premises. The scale of record keeping depends on the nature of the business at the premises.</P>
        <P>This legislation, which came into effect on 1 May 2012, has been put in place to assist with disease control in equines and the register will be used by the Department as a means of contacting owners/persons in charge of equine premises in the event of a disease outbreak to give advice about precautions/measures, etc., to be taken. The register could also be used to collect data on the Irish horse population through a census from time to time.</P>
        <P>Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) is a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy on sea lice controls in relation to farmed salmon is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry,</P>

This study took place over a period of ten years and concluded that infestation by sea lice was a minor component of the overall marine mortality of the stocks studied (Jackson et al published in the journal &lsquo;Aquaculture&rsquo; September 2011).</P>

        <P>As I have stated in previous replies to the Deputy and as was stated during the Seanad debate on 21 April 2011, the Kinsealy Research Centre is owned by Teagsac, the Agriculture, Food and Development Authority and the decision to close the Centre and transfer staff and activities to Ashtown is an operational matter for Teagasc. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of Teagasc management to assess, budget and plan the move to Ashtown.  I understand from Teagasc that the re-location is in progress and it is expected that staff and activities will be moved as facilities are made available in Ashtown.</P>
        <P>Teagasc advise that savings in overhead and staff costs can be realized from operating at one site in Ashtown as opposed to two sites (Kinsealy and Ashtown). They have carefully assessed the potential investment attributable to relocation and estimate potential once off upfront capital costs of &euro;4.8m. The actual costs will depend on the results of competitive tendering processes. Teagasc expect that the savings generated from consolidating activities in Ashtown will offset re-location costs over a 7 year period.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by Teagasc that the decision to upgrade education facilities in the Botanic Gardens predates the decision to consolidate operations in Ashtown and is necessary to accommodate the increased demand for horticultural courses.</P>

        <P>I am actively considering the possibility of re-opening Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) to allow for the submission of applications either on an amended basis from the existing scheme and/or on a limited scale, including the possibility of re-opening for applications later in the year. The full year cost of any new scheme will have to be met in 2013 and any decision to re-open AEOS will be taken in the context of consideration of the resources available and the need to remain within the agreed expenditure ceiling for my Department in 2013. I will make an announcement as soon as I have reached a decision on the situation.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider increasing compensation amounts paid to farmers who receive compensation under the disease eradication scheme;if he will review the current on &mdash; farm market valuation scheme and take into account the fact that pedigree cows can sell for prices exceeding the levels paid under the current scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the existing arrangements, the main compensation scheme for farmers whose herds are affected by TB or Brucellosis is the On-Farm Market Valuation Scheme, which was introduced in 2002 following discussions between my Department and representatives from the farm organizations. </P>
        <P>This scheme provides, in general, for compensation for cattle removed as reactors to be paid on the basis of &ldquo;Market Value&rdquo;, which is the equivalent price that might reasonably have been obtained for the animal, at the time of determination of compensation, from a purchaser on the open market if the animal was not affected by TB or Brucellosis or was not being removed as part of depopulation under the disease eradication programme. However, the scheme also provides for a ceiling on payments in respect of any individual animal. These ceilings were reviewed in 2007 and were increased from &euro;2,540 to &euro;2,800 in respect of any single animal, except in the case of one pedigree stock bull per farm (breakdown episode), where the ceiling was increased from &euro;3,175 to &euro;3,500 . While it is accepted that some pedigree stock are valued above the ceiling rates, herdowners are advised to take out insurance cover against losses which may occur in the event that any of their animals with a value in excess of these ceilings becomes infected with disease.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that, in addition to valuation payments, herdowners who experience a disease breakdown may also qualify for compensation under the Income Supplement, Hardship or Depopulation Grant Schemes, subject to the terms and conditions applying in each case.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these compensation arrangements provide a very comprehensive range of financial supports to herdowners whose herds are restricted as a result of a TB breakdown in their herd.</P>

        <P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2012 National Reserve.  The 2012 National Reserve caters for farmers who commenced farming after 17 May, 2010.  Applicants are required to submit a 2012 Single Payment application form detailing all lands which they are currently farming.  In addition, applicants are required to meet certain criteria with regard to income limits and educational qualifications. Off-farm income cannot exceed &euro;30,000 and total income, including farm income, cannot exceed &euro;40,000. Applicants must have obtained a FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture or its equivalent. The green certificate in farming is regarded as equivalent for this purpose. </P>
        <P>Processing of the 2012 National Reserve Scheme is ongoing.  My Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.

        <P>Seventeen aquaculture licences were issued in respect of sites located in non-Natura areas since late 2007.</P>
        <P>The low number of licences issued largely arises because the majority of areas for which aquaculture licences are sought are located in Natura areas.  An additional factor is that all aquaculture applications now undergo Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment which requires significant input from the Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors.</P>
        <P>The timeframe for processing a particular application varies depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact etc. Other factors include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
        <P>The purpose of the changes announced to the 2012 Terms and Conditions of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is to achieve the required savings, prompted by the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million.  However, in order to make these savings, it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, rather than simply apply an across-the-board cut, by reducing the maximum payable area, or reducing the rates of aid payable, or both. </P>
        <P>Choosing to opt for the technical adjustments ensures that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />To maintain the countryside;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While changes are being introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plan, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</P>
        <P>All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.  The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.</P>

This is a separate matter to the national initiative which is underway to develop a integrated marine plan for Ireland, known as our &ldquo;Ocean Wealth&rdquo;.  The first step in developing this was to draft and publish the document &ldquo;Our Ocean Wealth&rdquo;.  That was then the subject of a major public consultation which was carried out over recent months and is now complete.  The results of the consultation will help inform the plan, which is currently being drawn up by the Marine Institute and the Departments represented on the MCG, an inter-departmental Coordination Committee convened by the D/Taoiseach that I chair.

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
        <P>In Budget 2012, the Government announced capital funding of &euro;6m to fund a maintenance programme for childcare facilities.  The programme was open to both community not-for-profit childcare facilities and private childcare facilities, that are currently participating in one of the three childcare programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA).  The maximum grant available was &euro;50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to childcare settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment. </P>
        <P>Following a robust appraisal of all applications received, 290 applications were approved for funding with the average amount approved being &euro;21,000.   Of the total number of applications approved, 125 were from  private childcare facilities.  Of the total amount approved, 63% was approved for renovation/expansion works, 25% was approved for the purchase of equipment, 11% for maintenance works, and 0.5% was in respect of professional fees associated with the capital works.</P>
        <P>The figures available to my Department are broken down in line with the City and County Childcare Committee structures.  The figures for Laois indicates that 56 applications were received from childcare providers in the county and that 4 of these applications were approved for funding.  The total funding approved for these groups amounts to &euro;110,357.</P>
        <P>The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works, and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.  All applicants were notified by Pobal of the outcome and the Pobal website provides a facility for unsuccessful applicants to request by call-back, information to assist them in understanding the reasons for the outcome of their applications.</P>

        <P>The 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) were established in 2001 to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.  They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, social partners, childcare providers and parents.</P>
        <P>The role of the CCCs was expanded under the National Childcare Investment Programme to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, and they had a key role in the development of local childcare infrastructure, quality standards, training and information.  More recently, CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing administrative processes associated with the national childcare programmes (the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support programme).  They also support the performance and sustainability of services in their respective areas.</P>
        <P>Each CCC receives funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to implement its Local Implementation Plan.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs is &euro;11.3m, with Donegal County Childcare Committee receiving an allocation of  &euro;370,000.</P>
        <P>In relation to funding provided nationally by the HSE to support City and County Childcare Committees, the HSE has advised that there has been no decision to withdraw this funding.  However, I understand that at a local level funding has been reduced or has ceased in some areas due to the implementation of cost containment measures.  The HSE has advised that it allocates funding on a prioritisation basis which takes cognisance of the best interests of the child as paramount to any decision.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that funding totalling &euro;87,678 was provided to Donegal County Childcare Committee in 2011 and &euro;83,631 was provided in 2012.  The HSE is currently reviewing funding for 2013 with Donegal County Childcare Committee.</P>

        <P>The issue of local authority commercial rates comes within the remit of the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for fiscal policy, and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has responsibility for the local authorities.  </P>
        <P>The Valuation Office, which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance, is responsible for the implementation and interpretation of the Valuation Act 2001 under which commercial rates are levied by the local authorities.  The Valuation Office prepares valuation lists of commercial properties, as required by the Act, and local authorities are obliged to collect rates on properties which are listed.</P>
        <P>Following concerns expressed by childcare providers throughout the country, I raised the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan T.D., who confirmed that, in line with the existing legislative framework, local authorities have no discretion in the collection of commercial rates on properties which are on the Valuation List.  As stated, responsibility for the Valuation Act 2001 and the Valuation Office fall within the remit of the Minister for Finance, and therefore any change to the Act including any provision for exemptions is for his Department to consider, and my Department would have no role in this matter.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500, 508 and 509 together.</P>
        <P>Redeployment allows staff to be moved as a result of the rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public service bodies or where activities have assumed lesser priority arising from changing business needs. Similarly, where an organisation has posts in excess of its Employment Control limits, or has other budgetary or business reasons to redeploy staff, it must identify the number of posts at the different grade levels that will need to be redeployed. None of these situations currently pertain to my Department nor any agencies under the aegis of my Department. As a result, there are no surplus staff waiting for redeployment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government reform agenda represents an essential response to the litany of child protection failures outlined by the report of the Independent Child Death Review Group. The report represents clear evidence of why a reformed system of State care and intervention is needed. In this context the Programme for Government had already demonstrated the high priority it attaches to children and family services by establishing a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs (in place since March, 2011), and by committing to the early establishment of a stand-alone Child and Family Support Agency. I am working towards an establishment date of 1 January, 2013 for the agency.</P>
        <P>Under the leadership of Mr. Gordon Jeyes, CEO Designate of the new agency and National Director of the HSE&rsquo;s Children and Family Services, a &ldquo;change agenda&rdquo; is currently being implemented in Children and Family Services which will continue and be accelerated under the new agency; and will be further informed by the recommendations of this report. Key elements of this &ldquo;change agenda&rdquo; include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A service delivery model that will address a multi-agency, albeit differentiated, approach to managing the child welfare and protection system;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A nationwide consistency of approach in practice and implementation of Children First and child welfare and protection services generally;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Use of standardised definitions, criteria and thresholds for reporting and referrals including prioritisation of cases;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Greater reliance on real-time data on social work referrals and alternative care collated through HSE performance management indicators and the ongoing development of the National Child Care Information System;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved resource allocation responsive to changing needs;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Clearer management and budgetary accountability;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Better workforce planning, training and induction of new staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In advance of the establishment of the agency a new management and reporting structure is being put in place in Children and Family Services, and it has been allocated a distinct budget.  The Task Force which I established in September 2011 to advise on the new agency will present its final report by the end of this month and I look forward to addressing its recommendations relating to vision, governance and scope-of-services, such that the agency is established and up-and-running in 2013.  I am committed to working with Minister Roisin Shortall and the relevant agencies on progressing a fresh approach to addressing the harm posed by alcohol and other substance abuse. I am also committed to working with Minister Kathleen Lynch in addressing the many inter-agency deficits identified by the report in terms of access to Mental Health Services.</P>
        <P>I have indicated that I accept the essential criteria set out in the Report on developing an independent child death review structure, and I intend to consult further on this with a view to making an announcement in September on the appropriate future mechanism.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) will shortly assume a new role in relation to the oversight of child protection services, in addition to its current role in the inspection of children&rsquo;s residential centres, special care units and foster care settings. Next month HIQA will publish new National Standards for the Protection and Welfare of Children which will set out the key features of an effective child protection service and they clearly put the needs of children at the heart of that service. This new standards-led approach is central to enforcing a new culture of quality, effectiveness and accountability in Ireland&rsquo;s child protection services.  I believe the law needs to be strengthened in relation to aftercare services, and with advice from the Attorney General I intend to propose legislative change later this year, in the bill to establish the Child and Family Support Agency.  In relation to out of hours services it is important that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work advice and assistance. I am working with Gordon Jeyes towards this objective. The evaluation of two recent pilot projects will be of assistance in this context in terms of the nature of the services required.</P>
        <P>The report of the Independent Child Death Review Group is harrowing in its nature. It is a salutary lesson in how systemic failures can exact a terrible price on those most in need of quality integrated services. A great many changes have been put in train since this Government took office, and the months ahead will see many further positive developments for children, including the holding of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights. The Government is committed to transparency and honesty about the challenges in getting children&rsquo;s services right. Child protection will continue to be a high priority on our agenda and changes at every level &mdash; policy, law, structures and individual practitioner &mdash; have happened and will continue to happen.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>The European Commission took a case against the State regarding the VHI&rsquo;s derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which have, for some time, exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last.  In response to this judgement the Government agreed to engage with the Commission to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Work with the VHI and the Central Bank on the VHI&rsquo;s application for authorisation, with a decision to be taken later regarding the question of capitalisation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Examine the legal and legislative requirements to allow for the incorporation of the VHI as a limited company, in order to address the concerns of the EU Commissioner for Competition that the VHI may benefit from an unlimited State guarantee;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Examine other options for the future status of the VHI.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has informed the Commission that it expects to resolve the matter by 31 December 2013 at the latest.  Since the judgement was announced, Department of Health officials have been engaged in ongoing, positive discussion with officials of both the Directorate General for Competition and the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services, on the range of inter-related issues which must be resolved in order to address the Court judgement.</P>
        <P>Resolution of the issues involves a number of steps, including a number of EU State Aid matters which are being addressed in consultation with the EU Commission Directorate General for Competition.  The Government will make a decision on recapitalisation of the VHI when the Central Bank has determined the amount of any capital requirement and the EU Commission has approved a capital injection under State Aid rules.  VHI&rsquo;s capital requirement will be influenced by a range of issues, most notably the level of transfers it can expect under the new Risk Equalisation Scheme which is to be introduced from 1 January 2013.</P>
        <P>While the Government&rsquo;s policy of abolishing the bed designation system and to levy charges for all private patients in public hospitals will have an effect, my Department is working closely with the VHI and the other health insurers on the issue of costs in the market.  This engagement, through the Health Insurance Consultative Forum, is intended to assist the insurers in reducing their level of costs, thus minimising the impact of the bed designation policy change.</P>
        <P>A significant proportion of private patients who are provided with treatment by a public hospital are not currently charged for the services because of the current rules on bed designation.  In contrast, the public hospitals&rsquo; consultants receive private fees even where the hospital cannot levy its maintenance charge.  This represents a loss of income to the public hospital system and a significant subsidy to private insurance companies.</P>
        <P>It is intended to introduce new arrangements to allow public hospitals to raise charges in respect of all private patients in public hospitals.  My officials are carefully examining the potential implications of different approaches to achieving this significant change in policy.  I consider that the new system of charging will be fairer and is in keeping with the changes required along the road to Universal Health Insurance.</P>

It will be cross-departmental, conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high-level principles, goals and objectives and a road map to implementation.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

        <P>The decision to reduce the top up payment made to people with a disability attending rehabilitative training was implemented by the Health Service Executive (HSE) without informing the Department of Health. The reduction from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week, from the 1st January 2012, was communicated to the HSE Local Managers in advance of the Minister approving the National Service Plan for 2012.  This proposed measure sought to bring consistency to the top up bonus paid to people attending the HSE rehabilitative training scheme with similar payments paid in other State training schemes.  Any reduction in payments to individuals requires adequate advance notice to enable the recipients and indeed, service providers, to take the reduction into account in planning their support needs and other arrangements.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that people with a disability attending Rehabilitative Training are usually in receipt of a State payment such as the Disability Allowance.  Following examination of a report on this issue from the HSE, I requested the Executive not to proceed with this reduction pending a fuller consideration of the effects and consequences of this measure.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 523 together.</P>
        <P>A significant proportion of private patients who are provided with treatment by a public hospital are not currently charged for the services because of the current rules on bed designation.  In contrast, the public hospitals&rsquo; consultants receive private fees even where the hospital cannot levy its maintenance charge. This represents a loss of income to the public hospital system and a significant subsidy to private insurance companies.  </P>
        <P>It is intended to introduce new arrangements to allow public hospitals to raise charges in respect of all private patients in public hospitals.  My officials are carefully examining the potential implications of different approaches to achieving this significant change in policy.  Once a final policy decision has been taken I will be in a position to determine precisely what primary legislation, if any, will be required.  I would like to advise the Deputy that I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum this year which includes representatives of the country&rsquo;s three main insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department.  This provides a forum for engagement and consideration of, amongst other things, issues relating to bed charges and income collection, and the implementation of Universal Health Insurance.  I consider that the new system of charging will be fairer and is in keeping with the changes required along the road to Universal Health Insurance.</P>

        <P>Community rating<b> </b>means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to a private health insurer does not directly affect the health insurance premium paid. It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </P>
        <P>I am strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and sicker customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people and can confirm that any policy decisions taken with regard to bed designation will not impact on the principle of community rating.</P>

        <P>I currently have no proposals in relation to bed designation.  Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to note that the HIA has no role to play with regard to any decisions being made in the re-designation of beds in public hospitals. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market and provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA plays an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information, and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance and where appropriate it issues enforcement notices to enforce compliance with the Health Insurance Acts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 76,000 in the year to end-March 2012, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to-date, at less than 4% of the overall market. This leaves some 2.139 million, or 46.6% of the population, covered by private health insurance. Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers holding private health insurance are choosing to retain some level of health insurance cover rather than allowing policies to lapse completely.  </P>
        <P>Under Universal Health Insurance (UHI), everyone will be insured for health care and the current unfair discrimination between public and private patients will be removed. The Government&rsquo;s clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of UHI.  The Government is committed to fundamental reform of healthcare in Ireland that will deliver a single tier health system, where access is based on need, not income. A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. This reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years, to be supported by a number of key reform initiatives.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Consultative Forum, which includes representatives from the country&rsquo;s three main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health, is tasked with examining how costs in the health insurance industry can be reduced.  The Forum provides a vehicle for engagement and consideration of issues relating to the implementation of UHI. In addition, in February I established an Implementation Group on UHI which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for UHI and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme. The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance. The White Paper will outline the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of UHI. Preparation of the White Paper is a complex process.  It will involve significant financial modelling to support analysis of different design options and to estimate the cost of UHI. The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&rsquo;s term of office.</P>
        <P>In the interim, I am focusing on addressing the problems of the current private health insurance market, where insurers have a considerable financial incentive to cover younger, better risks rather than older, poorer risks. I am very concerned that any inefficiency in the management of claims is addressed before the introduction of UHI and am determined that measures currently being undertaken will have a significant impact in containing the cost of health insurance premiums, as we move towards the new system of Universal Health Insurance.</P>

        <P>I am not aware of any specific concerns raised by multinational corporations regarding the cost of private health insurance in this country being a significant factor for consideration when making foreign direct investment decisions. It is my understanding that the Deputy may be referring to any companies which pay health insurance premiums on behalf of employees, as an additional employment benefit. I refer the Deputy to a recent national consumer survey of the private health insurance market in Ireland commissioned by the Health Insurance Authority, a statutory regulator of the health insurance market in Ireland. The survey included an analysis of the effects of the economic environment on the attitudes and behaviour of consumers of private health insurance, part of which examined the issue of employer subscriptions. </P>
        <P>The survey found that eighteen percent of Irish businesses operate an employee health insurance scheme and that the sectoral profile of those businesses is similar to the overall sectoral breakdown of businesses in Ireland. It can be noted from the survey that two in three companies review the provision of employee private health insurance yearly, or more often, and that three in four companies intend to keep private health insurance subsidies the same. In addition, the level of subsidy has been increased by 19 percent of companies in the past two years, with almost seven in ten companies stating that they have kept subsidies the same over the past two years. This suggests a high level of stability from the employers&rsquo; viewpoint concerning the provision of employee private health insurance schemes.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting from the survey that the vast majority of companies intend maintaining the current private health insurance scheme for the considerable future.</P>

        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has tendered for a forensic accounting service to support it in its role of negotiating prices with private and voluntary nursing homes under Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  Once the tendering process is completed, tasks will be assigned to the successful supplier(s).  These will include an assignment to provide factual input to an NTPF review of nursing homes, including the nursing home referred to by the Deputy, which received funding for long-term residential care services under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 prior to the commencement of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The NTPF anticipates, at this stage, to have substantive information for initial review by end August.</P>
        <P>There are only 10 nursing homes nationally which received funding for long-term residential care services under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 prior to the commencement of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any question of prioritisation will be a matter for the NTPF which is independent in the performance of its function under Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</P>

        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 546, 560 and 585 together.</P>
        <P>Each Government Department has an Employment Control Framework (ECF) which sets an upper limit on staff numbers. Thus far my Department has complied with its ECF limits and redeployment has therefore not arisen. This position will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that that it does not have any employees currently in the public service redeployment pool.  Redeployment is to be voluntary, in so far as possible.  This protocol has proved largely successful.  Given the size of the health sector, any surplus staff are redeployed within the sector itself.  An estimated 4,500 redeployments has been reported by the health sector in its second annual progress report on implementing the PSA (reporting period of 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2012).  This is a significant increase from the previous reporting period (1st April 2010-31st March 2011), where a total of 750 staff redeployments were reported.   Redeployment is one of the main achievements of the Agreement in the health sector.  It is essential to allow local management to continue to deliver services with reduced staffing numbers and budgets, as well as service reconfigurations.  Numbers of staff involved can range from large to small, but all require staff flexibility and cooperation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other agencies under the remit of my Department, there are no staff either on, or awaiting placement on, a redeployment panel currently.</P>

        <P>In early October this year, the new emergency department at the Mater Hospital will open.  This is an integral part of the &euro;284m new adult hospital at the Mater and will provide significant additional space and capacity to treat patients with dignity and respect.  Patient comfort, safety and quality will be greatly enhanced in a significantly upgraded and top quality environment.</P>
        <P>The Mater fully supports and has committed itself to the implementation of 18 national clinical care programmes. The hospital has advised my department that, in July 2012, it will implement the first phase of the Acute Medicine Programme, which along with the Care of the Elderly Programme and the Elective Surgery Programme will significantly improve waiting times for patients awaiting admission to the hospital for both scheduled and unscheduled care. Three new consultant physician posts are currently being recruited as part of the Acute Medicine Programme. These will improve access to senior clinical decision makers and ensure that patients are diagnosed and treated as quickly and efficiently as possible, in order to avoid the need for acute hospitalisation where possible. This also involves changes in work practices and routines to ensure that waste and delays are addressed, to maximise the capacity available for acute patient care by keeping lengths of stay to a minimum.</P>
        <P>The hospital is working collaboratively with the Special Delivery Unit in these matters. Weekly focussed meetings ensure that progress is made to help further reduce excessive trolley waits and to meet nationally agreed waiting times for scheduled care.</P>

The organisation works in partnership with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide a range of flexible and tailor made services for people with acquired brain injury.  While the organisation received funding in excess of &euro;8m from the HSE in 2010 towards the provision of such services as Assisted Living; Home and Community Rehabilitation; Day Resource and Family Support services among others, the issue of recruitment of staff at Acquired Brain Injury Ireland is a matter for the organisation&rsquo;s Board of Directors to address..</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 563 and 565 together.</P>
        <P>The aim of rehabilitation is to enable the person to achieve the highest level of independence as possible. Desired outcomes can range from return to full independence in social and work activities, to a requirement for long term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of rehabilitation. Current services available to persons with acquired brain injury include: Acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; Multi-disciplinary community services; Long term assisted living supports; Family Support, Home Liaison and Social Work; Psychological Services; Supported Employment and Rehabilitation training services. These services are provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and a number of non-statutory organisations. Within Disability Services, the two main organisations that are funded by the HSE to meet the needs of service users with acquired brain injury nationally are Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and Headway Ireland. Last December, I welcomed the publication of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services. The report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on the reconfiguration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context. The Strategy is focused on the specific needs of those with neurological illness or injury outside of stroke. Five of the more common neurological conditions were selected for detailed review and analysis in the report. The five selected were Acquired Brain Injury &mdash; other than stroke &mdash; Cerebral Palsy; Multiple Sclerosis; Idiopathic Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease and Spinal Cord Injury. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy and to achieve the objectives of the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme which aims to: improve the quality of care; improve access to services and improve cost effectiveness. In this regard, both clinical and executive leads have been assigned and a national working group comprised of a team of experts has been established. I am happy therefore that the HSE National Service Plan 2012 for the development of the neuro-rehabilitation services includes a focus on inter-agency collaborative working. There is now a clear policy with a recommended service framework, that, when implemented, will ensure that Neuro-rehabilitation services are developed for those we serve in the most appropriate, effective and efficient way. I know that with the commitment of the HSE and service providers to the implementation process, we can achieve improved neuro-rehabilitation services for those persons with a neurological illness or injury or with a significant physical disability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU&rsquo;s performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.</P>
        <P>The NTPF does not have any remit around the delivery of disability services and I can confirm that the SDU and NTPF are not in the process of reviewing this policy at present.</P>

        <P>Medical cards are granted by the HSE on the basis of means and individual circumstances and all persons seeking a medical card must be assessed under the undue hardship principle.  There are no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group of patients with specific medical conditions.  The HSE may look beyond the applicants financial situation and have regard to other matters they consider appropriate in assessing a persons circumstances for a medical card.  This can address an individuals circumstances including an illness or medical circumstances which result in financial hardship.</P>
        <P>At the request of Minister Reilly, the HSE has set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.   The Programme for Government commits to reforming the current public health system by introducing Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.  As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing Universal GP Care within its first term of office.  Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  The Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.  Initially it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to persons with certain long-term illnesses.  It is my intention to have the Bill published and enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
        <P>Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  GPs who hold GMS contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  The GMS contract also stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, &ldquo;under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients and to GMS patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</P>

        <P>Ninety four submissions were received on a wide range of issues concerning disability policy in Ireland.

        <P>The Department of Health carries out a survey of long-stay units each year. Each long-stay unit (public, private and voluntary) is sent a questionnaire and the responses are collated by the Department. The aim of the survey is to provide statistics on the number of beds available for long-term care, how these beds are used and the types of residents who occupy these beds. The results of the surveys are used to prepare the Long-Stay Activity Statistics Reports which are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The Long-Stay Activity Statistics for 2010 (the most recent year available) reported that about 6% of those in long-term residential care were under 65 years of age, 3.5% were between 65 and 69 years of age and 90.4% were 70 years and older.The Deputy should be mindful that these are self reported survey results and the response rate for 2010 was 80% of long-stay units. </P>

In-patient staffing levels for approved centres are decided by the service provider in accordance with these provisions and on the basis of need to ensure a safe and appropriate level of care.  The staffing required for the new unit at Beaumont has not been decided yet.  Of the 414 posts set out in the Service Plan to implement the &euro;35 million special allocation for mental health to progress <i>A Vision for Change, </i>the HSE is now proposing to convert 31 of these posts in the Dublin Mid Leinster region to nursing that will be assigned in the immediate term to acute in-patient services.  However, it is intended that this will be done in the context of introducing a nursing floor for the acute in-patient and community services in that region consistent with the provision of safe in-patient services in line with <i>A Vision for Change, </i>the Mental Health Commission Quality Framework for Mental Health Services in Ireland and the roll out of the clinical care programmes. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>There has been a growing body of evidence over recent years that the use of sunbeds, especially by children, should be restricted because of the associated increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems. Currently, there are no statutory regulations governing sunbed use. Government has approved the drafting of the Public Health (Sunbeds) Bill. e Bill will prohibit the use by those under 18 years of age and sets out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions proposed for inclusion in the Bill are:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) a prohibition on operators of sunbed premises from allowing anyone under 18 years of age to use a sunbed on their premises;</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;</P>
        <P LI="1">(iii) an exemption for medical treatment to be provided;</P>
        <P LI="1">(iv) a prohibition on the use of sunbeds in unsupervised commercial premises;</P>
        <P LI="1">(v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions);</P>
        <P LI="1">(vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the Health Service Executive (HSE);</P>
        <P LI="1">(vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff;</P>
        <P LI="1">(viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance;</P>
        <P LI="1">(ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear;</P>
        <P LI="1">(x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;</P>
        <P LI="1">(xi) a prohibition on promotional marketing practices;</P>
        <P LI="1">(xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(xiii) a provision whereby sunbed users are required to acknowledge/accept the risk associated with sunbed use (consent forms).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand from the Office of the Attorney General that drafting of this legislation is expected to be completed in late 2012. e Bill, when drafted,will need to be notified to the EU Commission under the Technical Standards Directive prior to its publication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>Improving access for patients, to both unscheduled and scheduled care in hospitals across the country, is central to the role of the Special Delivery Unit .  Since the SDU become operational in September 2011, it has worked with hospitals across the country, including University Hospital Galway.  The hospital works closely with the SDU Liaison Officer and there are weekly meetings held with the management teams of both hospitals, along with management from the local community services.  In addition to discussing current performance issues and trends, the Liaison Officer works with the hospitals to improve patient pathways and develop and improve operational issues.</P>
        <P>While the provision of funding is not a core function of the SDU, there are limited resources available to assist hospitals to meet targets on unscheduled and scheduled care.  For unscheduled care (emergency departments), funding was made available to University Hospital Galway as part of the successful SDU initiative in 2011 to ensure that the number of patients waiting in ED was kept to a minimum over the Christmas and New Year periods.</P>
        <P>A limited amount of funding has also been made available in 2012 to assist the hospitals to meet their trolley wait targets. For University Hospital Galway, funding related to opening additional bed capacity for short-periods and also an initiative for hospital avoidance for older people run by the geriatricians.  There was also an an initiative involving community and hospital liaison, weekend liaison nurses and home support, to enable earlier discharge home and avoid hospital admissions.</P>
        <P>To date, the SDU interventions in relation to unscheduled care have reduced the number of patients waiting on trolleys in ED. In relation to University Hospital Galway, up to 8 June 2012, there has been a reduction of 8.7% in the numbers waiting on trolleys, compared with the same period in 2011.</P>
        <P>For scheduled care (inpatient and day case surgery) last year, I instructed all hospitals that no person should be waiting more than 12 months for surgery by the end of the year. The scheduled care access targets set for public hospitals for 2012 are that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for surgery, no child should wait more than 20 weeks for surgery and no person requiring a routine GI endoscopy should wait more than 13 weeks.</P>
        <P>This year the hospital is progressing towards the 2012 access targets, assisted by a targeted programme of support agreed between the hospital and the NTPF. This support is directed towards adult ENT, urology and GI endoscopy procedures and also towards paediatric ENT and general surgery. These are the areas where the greatest challenges, in terms of faster access times for procedures, exist.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

        <P>In early November 2010 the then Government approved a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme  and a voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme for certain categories of staff in the HSE, as well as bodies funded by the HSE.  The purpose of the schemes was to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate public health sector reform.  The schemes were open to both management and administrative grades, and general support staff.  The cost of the schemes in 2010 was approximately &euro;100.4m, of which  about &euro;58m was in respect of the VR scheme.  Final uptake for the schemes was 2,025 individuals (1,626 WTE).  Of the 2,025 individuals, 639 (32%) departed under the voluntary early retirement scheme and 1,386 (68%) availed of the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
        <P>The first annual Health Sector report on progress and savings achieved under the Public Service Agreement  (Croke Park) covered the period March 2010 to March 2011 and reported that under these schemes there was a gross saving of &euro;60m in 2011.</P>
        <P>The second annual Health Sector report on progress and savings achieved under the Agreement, covering the period 1st April 2011 to 31st   March 2012, was submitted in May of this year.

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 606 and 607 together. </P>
        <P>The matter of conducting a study of major towns to establish the availability of tourist coach parking facilities is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland who are responsible for encouraging promoting and supporting the development of tourist traffic within the State.</P>
        <P>I am informed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland that, in association with the Department of the Environment, it has recently launched the Tourist Towns awards scheme.  This awards scheme which is open to the top 100 Tidy Towns from the previous year, will focus on the quality of visitor facilities and the quality of the visitor experience in these towns.  The criteria that each town will be assessed against will include the provision and quality of parking facilities in these towns and villages, which would include coach parking.  While this is a qualitative exercise, it would certainly serve to highlight any significant concerns around the issue of coach parking in these towns and could lead to a more quantitative study if this issue was considered to be an impediment to the sustainable development of tourism in any of the towns, or if any of the town were missing an opportunity which could be capitalised upon through the provision of better planned coach parking.</P>
