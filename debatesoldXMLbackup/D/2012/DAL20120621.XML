        <P>Everybody agrees that the report published yesterday on the deaths of children in care is harrowing.  It is worth reading some of the statistics.  The report provides details of 196 children who died between 2000 and 2010 by natural and unnatural causes.  They include children who were in the care of the State at the time of death, young adults in aftercare and other children who were not in care of the State but who were known to the HSE.  A total of 84 of the children and young adults assessed in the report died by natural causes.  Some 112 of the children and young adults in care, aftercare or not in care but known to the HSE assessed in the report died by unnatural causes.  Of these, 17 were in care, 27 in aftercare and 68 were not in care but known to HSE family services.  Five died in house fires, four by accidental drowning, 17 in road accidents, 16 were unlawfully killed and, at least, 28 died by suicide.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs ensured the report was published in its entirety and without redaction.  I also acknowledge the foresight shown by the former Minister of State Barry Andrews in commissioning the report.  The Minister and the former Minister of State showed huge courage in the face of enormous system resistance to ensure its publication.  Mr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Nora Gibbons have done a heroic job in shining a light on a very dark chapter in Irish life.</P>
        <P>The report challenges us as a society.  We need to look hard at how children are not only protected by the State which obviously has a very important role to play, but also by families and communities.  The report comments on our attitude to alcohol and how children are exposed to it.  These are uncomfortable habits that we need to confront.  It is important that there be all-party agreement in dealing with the recommendations made.  I know the Minister is meeting the all-party committee later.  The introduction of a 24 hour social work system needs to be discussed and agreement sought on it as soon as possible.  That files on children in care or under the watch of the HSE are either unavailable or missing is so wrong.  The computerisation process needs to be speeded up.  We need to continue to ensure the social work system and the social worker service are exempt from the moratorium.</P>
        <P>The Proclamation states the children of the nation should be cherished.  As we know from the report, there are provisions in Bunreacht na h-&Eacute;ireann that have been identified as presenting a difficulty.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the legislative timetable for the holding of the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?  Will he confirm that it will be a stand-alone referendum, given the complexity of the issues involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>We all agree that the report published yesterday is shocking.  What it describes is a disgrace, the way in which children died while in the care of the State or afterwards.  My own reaction after reading about some of the cases was that this was in the period of great prosperity.  The report covers the period between 2000 and 2010, when there was so much partying going on, when there was much clapping on the back about how wonderful the country was, how great we were doing and how much more money we had.  However, during this time there were children dying in appalling circumstances.  In some cases, they were neglected by the State, in some by their families and in others by those charged, either officially or through familial links, with responsibility for them.  It makes for really shocking reading.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that all of us, on a non-partisan basis, need to work to progress the measures needed to protect children.  I thank him for acknowledging the leading role the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is playing in that regard.  When the Government was formed, we decided that we were going to prioritise the protection of children and meeting their needs.  We have made progress across several areas, with the establishment of a dedicated Department, in putting the guidelines on a statutory basis and the ring-fencing of budgets.</P>
        <P>It is our intention to hold a referendum on the rights of children in the autumn.  It is also our intention that the referendum will be held on a stand-alone basis.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, has been involved in consultations with Members of the House, with various political parties and with organisations that work in the area of children&rsquo;s rights to finalise matters in advance of the referendum.  The intention is that the referendum will be held in the autumn and that the necessary legislation to facilitate it will be presented when the House returns after the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>I have a concern that there may be a recurrence of what happened in respect of the referendums held last year, namely, that the legislation will be rushed and that the complex issues involved will become lost in that rush.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to indicate the date in the autumn on which the referendum will be held or the likely timescale relating to the legislation.  I am concerned that the referendum will be hijacked by people campaigning on issues which have nothing to do with it and that they will use the rush to which I refer to create confusion in respect of the genuine issue with which we are &mdash; as outlined in the report &mdash; seeking to deal.  I hope the report we are now discussing will receive as much attention as that which everyone in the House has been reading this morning.  I am concerned that a rushed referendum may lead to confusion and may lead to a genuine proposal becoming lost in the melee of an uneven debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>The referendum will not be rushed, particularly as it has been signalled for some time.  It has been made clear by the Government &mdash; in its programme for Government &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Taoiseach that the referendum will proceed and the intention is that it will be held in the autumn.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a set timetable in respect of the introduction of the legislation, the publication of the proposal etc.  That timetable will be complied with.</P>
        <P>In the context of other issues affecting the campaign, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that the referendum will be held on a stand-alone basis.  We have had some experience of referenda being held where two or three proposals were put to the people on the same day and in the ensuing melee, the debate on one issue can have an impact on that relating to another.  As a result of the importance of the issue under discussion, it is intended that the referendum will proceed on a stand-alone basis.  Those of us in this House should endeavour to provide unified leadership on this issue.  One of the issues that is identified in the report is the necessity for early intervention in many instances.  When the Minister brings forward her proposals, the House should endeavour not to politicise the issue or take partisan positions on it &mdash; I acknowledge Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s commitment in this regard and thank him for it &mdash; rather, we should do what is in the best interests of the children of the country.  We should also ensure that a clear proposal is put to the people and that they be given the time, space and opportunity to consider, debate and reflect on this and then vote on it in the referendum.</P>

        <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire mo chomhbhr&oacute;n f&eacute;in agus comhbhr&oacute;n mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh le clann James Nolan, a fuair b&aacute;s go trag&oacute;ideach sa Pholainn agus glacaim go mbeadh gach duine sa Teach seo ag lu&iacute; leis sin agus go nguimid suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; ar James f&eacute;in agus t&aacute;&aacute;r smaointe ag dul leis an chlann ag an am trag&oacute;ideach seo.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the impact of Government cutbacks in respect of the 94,000 people who are in receipt of rent supplement.  Between rent supplement, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements, private landlords are being subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of well more than &euro;500 million.  This is the wrong approach to take to housing but the Government is determined to continue subsidising landlords in this way, despite the fact that it would be far more cost-effective to invest in the purchase of social housing via NAMA or otherwise.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that less than half of the &euro;500 million used to subsidise private landlords is spent on social housing, which would come under the control of local authorities?  Surely the logic of this must jump out at him and others in the House who are of a socialist persuasion.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to lower the rent caps and force individual tenants &mdash; under the threat of being made homeless &mdash; into often unwinnable negotiations with landlords is causing untold misery and upheaval for families throughout the country.  If immediate savings are to be made in the rent supplement scheme, why does the Department not &mdash; in line with the proposal contained in the programme for Government in respect of other services for social welfare recipients that are subsidised &mdash; negotiate directly with landlords to secure reduced levels of rent?  My office and those of many other Deputies, including those whose parties are in government, are dealing with families that are being obliged to move out of their homes and the areas in which they live and move their children to other schools as a result of this heavy-handed approach to negotiating with landlords.</P>
        <P>I should not need to inform the T&aacute;naiste, the leader of the Labour Party, that those in receipt of rent supplement are among the most vulnerable in both our society and the rental sector.  The already live in accommodation that is at the bottom of the price scale.  Where exactly are these people supposed to go if their landlords refuse to reduce their rents.  Some community welfare officers have suggested that they approach the homeless service.  The numbers sleeping rough in Dublin and, I presume, elsewhere throughout the country have risen.  The increase in Dublin in this regard stand as 20%.  Where will these people&rsquo;s children attend school in September?  Many of them are being obliged to move far from the areas in which they previously lived.  Will the Government reconsider its heartless decision and come up with a fairer way to find the savings required?  Will the T&aacute;naiste encourage the relevant Department to negotiate directly with private landlords and not leave the onerous burden in this regard on the vulnerable tenants to whom I refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dt&uacute;s aont&uacute; leis an gcomhbhr&oacute;n a rinneadh le clann Nolan de bharr bh&aacute;s James Nolan sa Pholainn.  Mar is eol don Teach t&aacute; ambas&aacute;id na h&Eacute;ireann sa Pholainn ag comhoibri&uacute; leis an chlann faoi l&aacute;thair.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify a number of points.  The budget in respect of homelessness has been maintained and is not being cut as alleged by Sinn F&eacute;in.  A considerable sum of money is being paid out through the rent allowance system to support tenants in the payment of rent.  The purpose of placing a cap on the amount of rent to which that allowance can be applied is precisely to ensure that the State will not be subsidising landlords but that instead it will provide assistance to tenants to enable them to pay their rent.  Another purpose of the cap is to ensure that landlords will not exploit the rent allowance system to hike up rents in anticipation that the State will cover people&rsquo;s rent in any event.</P>
        <P>The Government has made a decision to transfer long-term rent supplement to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government next year.  The purpose of this is to achieve better co-ordination in respect of the way in which the rent supplement system operates and to integrate that system with that which relates to the provision of housing.  There is ongoing engagement with NAMA in the context of acquiring housing from it to be made available as social housing.  Again, this should be of assistance in reducing the amount paid out in rent supplement.</P>
        <P>What we must do in the first instance is ensure that people&rsquo;s housing needs are met.  We must also ensure that those who are in private rented accommodation are given support in circumstances where they are unable to pay their rent.  That support will be provided through the rent supplement system.  As the Deputy is aware, the RAS scheme allows local authorities to enter into longer-term arrangements with landlords.  Under this scheme rent is negotiated between housing authorities and landlords, usually on a four-year basis.  We would like to see this being done to a greater extent, rather than have rent negotiations conducted exclusively between a tenant and a landlord.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I had not suggested the homeless budget was being cut.  In fact, it will probably have to be increased as tenants whose landlords will not reduce their rent are obliged to depend on services for homeless persons.</P>
        <P>I note what the T&aacute;naiste said about the use of NAMA properties for social housing purposes.  Is it the intention to lease such properties only or will the Government take the economically savvy decision to acquire the properties outright or transfer them, which would be logical, thereby addressing the housing waiting lists and the illogical spend to private landlords?</P>
        <P>Has there been any discussion of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which the T&aacute;naiste mentioned?  People who avail of the scheme are now being removed from the housing waiting list, despite the fact that the tenancies offered are short term and, therefore, insecure in the longer term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that the homeless budget is not being cut.  It is, in fact, being maintained.</P>
        <P>With regard to arrangements with NAMA and discussions on acquiring housing from the agency, it will depend on the houses available.  In some cases it will be appropriate to acquire houses and in others to rent them.  Leasing terms will depend on the set of circumstances involved.  The intention is that residential property currently under the control of NAMA will be made available as social housing for those in need of it.  That work is being progressed by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>
        <P>I am aware of some cases of people being removed from the housing list when they have been offered RAS properties.  The circumstances vary.  Some housing applicants are happy to accept RAS tenancies.  In other cases in which RAS tenancies were offered the tenants were assured that they would not be removed from the housing list.  In these cases I understand they are being maintained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>Rent supplement was introduced as a short-term measure.  The original idea was that rent to a private landlord would be supplemented for a short period of time until a person was housed through the local authority system or rehoused in some other way.  It has become a much more long-term provision.  The intention is that the longer term element of the rent supplement system will be integrated with the housing provision measures of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>One of the best ways to protect the children of the State is to provide them with secure housing.  In the Visitors Gallery is a small sample of the 96,000 families on housing waiting lists.  They are the victims of housing cuts and policies imposed by Labour Party Ministers.  Leanne Massey who has four children was recently made homeless because of rent allowance cuts.  She is now separated from two of her children and sleeping on a sofa in a two-bedroom house with her grandmother and great-grandmother.  Mandy O&rsquo;Brien, Nicola Lapraku and Elizabeth Martin were all recently made homeless as a result of the reduction of rent allowance caps.  Paul Corcoran was homeless for seven years and recently forced back onto the streets.  Michelle Murphy spent four years at No. 3 on the medical transfer list.  Peter Cleary faces homelessness.</P>
        <P>Is it not an obscenity that there are 96,000 on housing lists and waiting up to ten years to be housed, when the census figures show there are 230,000 empty dwellings in the State?  Is it not an outrage that we are paying &euro;500 million a year in supplements to private landlords and developers when, if we provided council housing for those on the waiting lists, we would save the State &euro;500 million a year and probably generate another &euro;250 million in rental revenue for the State?</P>
        <P>Why is the Labour Party abandoning the policy of direct provision of council housing and, effectively, privatising the social housing market to the benefit of private developers and greedy speculators, the very people who bankrupted the country?  What is the T&aacute;naiste going to do for those on the housing lists and in the Visitors Gallery?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>The Labour Party is not abandoning its commitment to the provision of housing for those who need it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
        <P>It has done so already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>As Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, there are 230,000 empty dwellings in the State.  As I said in reply to an earlier question, the Government is working with NAMA to have houses transferred to the public system in order that they will be available for people who need them.  That makes sense.  If residential property is not being used and is tied up in NAMA, it makes sense to use these dwellings to make homes available for people who need them.</P>
        <P>A very large sum of money is being paid in rent supplement.  However, it is not a solution, as the Deputy seems to suggest, that the Government stop paying this money.  If we were to stop doing so, the people who would suffer are the tenants who need to be provided with housing.  Yes, we want to reduce the amount involved.  That is why we have capped the rental levels in order that landlords do not exploit the rent supplement system.  We do not want them to hike up rents in the expectation that the State will fork out any amount of money they ask for.  We have to have a limit on the upper amount that can be paid.  We need to continue to pay rent supplement in order that people in private rented accommodation will not be left vulnerable to their landlords and can continue to have secure housing.</P>
        <P>We are shifting the responsibility for the rent allowance system to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are integrating it with the provision of housing in order that there will be a joined-up approach to the provision of housing. This is a reform that is long overdue.  We are joining up the provision of social housing, assistance for people in private rented accommodation and the making available of dwellings that are not being used and could be used to provide housing for those who need it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>That is an unsatisfactory and disingenuous response.  We will continue to subsidise private landlords unless the State directly provides council housing.  If there are 230,000 empty dwellings, many of them in the hands of NAMA and State-financed banks, they should be transferred directly into council ownership, but that is not what the Government is doing.  Instead, it is continuing to pay State money to private landlords, banks or whoever are the private owners of these properties.  This is, effectively, privatising the provision of social housing and creating the conditions for a new slum landlord class and tenement housing reminiscent of that at the beginning of the 20th century.</P>
        <P>There are people in the Visitors Gallery who are homeless as a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s reduction of the rent cap.  Does this not prove that its policy is a failure?</P>
        <P>What will the Government do to get those people off the housing list and put them in council houses, either NAMA properties taken into public ownership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;or through the direct provision of council houses to end the abomination whereby 96,000 people are on the housing list at a time when we have nearly a quarter of a million empty properties in the State?  It is an obscenity.</P>

        <P>What we need to do and what we are working on is doing what is necessary to get people housed as quickly as possible.  I repeat that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning is working with NAMA to transfer to the State houses and dwellings that are currently in NAMA ownership so that those dwellings will be made available for people who have a housing need.  The work is under way and I hope Deputy Boyd Barrett supports it.  While the work is under way and while people are waiting to be housed through the local authority system, there is a necessity where they are in private rented accommodation that support is provided for them in paying their rent to private landlords.  That is what the rent allowance system is for.  The Government does not intend to abolish the rent allowance system but we do intend to join it up with the housing system.  However, let us be clear about this.  We are not going to pay in rent allowance any amount a landlord thinks he can extract from the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>It has normally been the practice that the report of the independent commission is accepted by Government and legislation is prepared and brought into the House to give effect to it.  I expect that is what will happen on this occasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>My question is on the same issue.  In the coming days and over the weekend, everyone outside of the House and in it will be perusing the report of the Constituency Commission.  Could the T&aacute;naiste give an indication that there will be discussion in the House next week or whether we must wait for the legislative change to come to the House before we can discuss what is contained within the report on boundary changes?</P>
        <P>Will the Government bring forward legislation to abolish ground rents, as both parties in government have demanded in the past?  Many households on whom the household charge is imposed are also expected to pay an annual ground rent, in some cases to landlords in England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I am just asking whether it is intended to introduce legislation to abolish ground rents to landlords abroad.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>Two issues have been raised by the Deputy.  First, on the House debating the report of the Constituency Commission, that will be done by way of a debate when the Bill is brought before the House to give effect to it.  It is not intended to have a debate in advance of the Bill.  A ground rents Bill is not on the legislative programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
        <P>On promised legislation, the health insurance (risk equalisation) Bill has been promised for some time.  It must be enacted before 1 January 2013.  Is it expected to have it published and debated in the House in this session or have the heads of the Bill been discussed in Cabinet?  Similarly, the criminal law (sexual offences) Bill is regarded as being an important Bill for the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  Likewise, I wish to inquire about the explosives Bill.  Given the ready use of explosives with tragic consequences on an ongoing basis throughout the country, is it possible, first, to bring the Bill before the House as a matter of urgency and, second, to incorporate within it some means of controlling access to explosives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>We can only deal with when the legislation will be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
        <P>The heads of the health insurance (risk equalisation) Bill were approved by Government this week and it is intended that it would be published at the end of this year.  The sexual offences Bill is being prepared in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The explosives Bill is intended for later this year.</P>

        <P>When is it intended to introduce the health governance Bill and will the special delivery unit be put on a statutory basis?  I ask this in the context of the grotesque overcrowding at Beaumont Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit last Monday night.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, is sitting beside the T&aacute;naiste.  There were trolleys three deep.  It was horrendous.  When we were all over on this side of the House, many a morning on the Order of Business the T&aacute;naiste lambasted the former Government for allowing emergency rooms to be in the condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 before the House.  It received a thorough and interesting debate in the Seanad as well as cross-party welcome.  The Bill is being introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform further to the commitment made in the programme for Government to progress the statute law revision project to enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with local and personal Acts from 1851 to 1922 and private Acts from 1751 to 1922 and is the final element of the review of primary legislation enacted prior to Independence and, as such, clears the way for my Department to proceed with other measures of statute law revision, for example, the review of post-1922 legislation and the large body of secondary legislation that predates Independence.</P>
        <P>The Bill identifies 796 Acts that are not suitable for repeal at this time and will be retained on the Statute Book.  It will repeal all other legislation within its scope.  It proposes expressly to repeal 2,983 Acts in total, including 1,358 obsolete local and personal Acts and 1,625 private Acts, while implicitly repealing a further 18,953 Acts.  If the implied repeals are included, this Bill is the largest and most extensive repealing measure not only in the history of the State, but also the most extensive single statute law revision measure ever introduced in any jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, the need for a pre-Independence process of statute law revision arises from the terms of Article 73 of the Saorst&aacute;t Constitution and Article 50 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which carried over all pre-1937 law, including statute law.  The Bill signals a profound change.  Following its enactment, it may no longer be said that all pre-Independence primary legislation has been automatically carried forward without analysis merely by virtue of Article 50 and legal inertia.  All primary legislation that remains in force will have been specifically assessed and a deliberate decision will have been made by a sovereign Irish Parliament to retain the Acts in question.</P>
        <P>Statute law revision concerns the removal of obsolete legislation from the Statute Book that is no longer relevant, whose purpose is exhausted or that has ceased to be in force otherwise than by reason of express repeal.  The &ldquo;Statute Book&rdquo; is an informal term used to describe all primary legislation, including public general, local and personal and private Acts and all secondary legislation, including orders and regulations that have not previously been repealed or revoked.  Primary legislation consists of public general Acts &mdash; already reviewed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 &mdash; as well as private and local and personal Acts.  Private Acts are those concerned with the affairs of a single individual or body.  Such Bills are enacted using a different procedure from that used for public and general Acts.  The private Acts listed in the Bill include many naturalisations, divorces and provisions for certain landed estates.  Local and personal Acts are concerned with matters affecting a limited section of the community such as a single local authority, local area or company.  Local and personal Acts were published in a separate series between 1797 and 1922.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of company registration law in 1844 and the introduction of limited liability for companies in 1855, most commercial companies were incorporated by an Act of Parliament.  While local and personal Acts and private Acts are not of general application in the same way as public general Acts, they contain rights, duties, liabilities and obligations and, therefore, require careful analysis to identify those with ongoing relevance and application.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the Statute Law Revision Bills are only concerned with removing from the Statute Book laws that have become spent or obsolete.  The complementary process of statute law reform involves changing the content of laws to modernise them, for example, by repealing old laws but re-enacting them with amendments in modern form.  In respect of the pre-1922 Acts retained by the Statute Law Revision Acts, the process of statute law reform is under way in several areas through the medium of subject-specific legislation.  There are several reasons it is undesirable for spent or obsolete legislation to remain on the Statute Book.  In simple terms, without clarification, it is misleading for users who may believe that solely by virtue of an Act remaining on the Statute Book it retains some modern effect or relevance.  A user of the Statute Book may undertake the time-consuming task of carefully analysing several statutes only to come to the conclusion that they are, in fact, spent or obsolete.  Accordingly, the removal of legislation which has lost its relevance provides valuable assistance in modernising the Statute Book.  The removal of such obsolete legislation, therefore, renders the Statute Book clear, concise and more accessible for all users and facilitates the process of regulatory reform.</P>
        <P>The statute law revision project was first established by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office in 2003 and has been accommodated since by the Office of the Attorney General.  It is now located in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the relevant Departments which have worked assiduously on the project since 2003.  It is an evolving process.  We have been deliberately working through the statutes and Acts concerned to radically modernise statute law.  This work has occurred in other countries and is important in modernising our entire body of law.  There has been significant engagement between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to prepare the Schedules.  Each of the 23,000 Acts was assessed individually, which highlights the extraordinary work that has been done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>I am conscious that the Bill is highly technical and that the Minister of State was originally given 15 minutes.  Is it agreed that we give him the full time he needs to complete his script?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>Each of the 22,886 Acts within the scope of the Bill was assessed individually.  This assessment determined, first, whether an Act was deemed applicable to Ireland.  A broad interpretation of applicability to Ireland was used and this included Acts with a tangible connection to Ireland.  In taking this cautious approach &mdash; one does not want existing rights to be affected by getting rid of an Act &mdash; some Acts might not appear relevant to Ireland on a cursory reading of the Short Title or subject matter alone.  However, following examination, these Acts are deemed to be applicable as they contain provisions directly relating to Ireland.  For example, certain Acts apply to Irish ships, or refer to all ports in the United Kingdom, or they contain a provision which allows the Act to be enforced in the Irish courts of the time.  In particular, naturalisation Acts relate to the legal status of persons born outside the United Kingdom and provide that they are to be deemed natural born citizens.  These naturalisation Acts automatically apply to Ireland, being a part of the United Kingdom at the time of the passing of the Acts in question.</P>
        <P>Acts that were deemed to apply to Ireland and had not been previously repealed were then assessed to determine whether they were suitable for repeal or whether their provisions warranted retention.  The statute law revision project also took a cautious approach in deciding whether an Act was suitable for repeal.  The local and personal and private Acts are, therefore, only listed for repeal where they are wholly obsolete or spent.  If it became apparent during the course of the assessment of an Act that any of its provisions might have some ongoing relevance or effect, the Act is being retained for the moment.</P>
        <P>The decision to repeal or retain an Act was taken in conjunction with a process of consultation.  For all Acts listed in the Bill, the statute law revision project engaged in consultation with relevant Departments and local authorities.  Relevant semi-State bodies and other parties were also consulted on certain individual Acts.  The draft Schedules were also placed on the website of the Office of the Attorney General, as well as the complete list of the subject matters and Short Titles, if any, of all pre-independence local and personal and private Acts.</P>
        <P>While a large proportion of the Acts mentioned in the Bill appear to relate to specific localities or particular organisations, when viewed collectively, they can provide an interesting historical snapshot of the Ireland of the time.  For example, the years from 1851 to 1922 saw the expansion of the railways across the country.  During that period various railway companies were established for the purpose of the construction of numerous lines in a piecemeal fashion.  It is also no surprise that as an island nation and as a direct consequence of the increase in the frequency of shipping and trade at the time, a large proportion of the Acts refer to the improvement of ports and harbours.  However, amidst the progress made in the spheres of transport and industry, it is notable that this period also saw the establishment of the Dublin Science and Art Museum in 1877, more commonly known today as the National Museum of Ireland.  Another Act of note from 1877 governs St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green in Dublin and authorises Sir Arthur Guinness to construct paths, roads and fountains to create public and ornamental pleasure grounds for the general public.  Thereafter, the new public park was transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works to be managed and maintained for the recreation and pleasure of the public.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 repeals approximately 250 Acts which provide for specific divorces which date from a time when an Act of Parliament was the only way in which to gain a divorce.  This was a practice that continued in the Free State Parliament until the 1930s where each divorce required a decree of government.  Approximately 70 Irish divorce Acts passed through Parliament between 1857 and 1922, the majority of which were passed in the two decades prior to independence.</P>
        <P>The last Irish divorce Act to pass through Parliament was Morton&rsquo;s Divorce Act 1922, which received the royal assent on 31 May 1922, just a few months before the statutory divorce jurisdiction went into abeyance on Irish independence.</P>
        <P>I will not go through each section of the Bill as it is self-explanatory, setting out the Bills to be removed and those which remain.  They are set out in the Schedules and we can consider them if Members wish.  Having regard to the volume of legislation involved and the careful analysis given to each Act, it is clear this Bill is the culmination of significant work for those involved.  I have acknowledged and thanked those involved on Second Stage in the Seanad but they certainly warrant mention again here today.</P>
        <P>This House is indebted to the work done behind the scenes over the past several years to bring this Bill to fruition.  I wish to thank the researchers and management of the statute law revision project as well as Parliamentary Counsel and the staff of the Office of the Attorney General for their dedicated work on this Bill.  However, this Bill would not have been possible without the assistance of a number of external sources.  First, I acknowledge the indispensable assistance provided to the State by the Parliamentary Archives of the House of Lords and House of Commons, Westminster.  For a number of years Parliamentary Archives have kindly lent the statute law revision project various texts of Acts which are not available in any form in Ireland.  We are grateful for such co-operation.  In addition, project members travelled to the archives last year to view specific texts on-site and were provided with every assistance by the staff of the archives.  I extend my sincere appreciation to the Parliamentary Archives and the staff and acknowledge that without their generous and public-spirited assistance and co-operation, it would not have been possible to bring this Bill forward.</P>
        <P>The project staff also received texts of Acts and valuable assistance and co-operation from the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, the National Library and the National Archives, and I also wish to express my gratitude to those institutions for their support and assistance.  I am sure that Members will join in expressing our gratitude for all the assistance received in bringing this extensive legislation before us for consideration and approval.</P>
        <P>If asked in simple layman&rsquo;s terms about the benefit of this, it is clear.  The State has an obligation to improve regulation and ensure that one&rsquo;s understanding of the law, including its readability, language and uses, are clear for all to see.  By clearing up much of the obsolete legislation, we are codifying the Statute Book and putting it in a much more user-friendly way.  Clearing up this issue makes it easier for the legal profession, its requirements and how people understand their rights under Irish law.  That is significant.  As Deputies are aware, the OECD has consistently highlighted the need for Ireland, as a small country, to improve its public sector with enhanced regulation.  This is a very clear example of this coming about.</P>
        <P>Colleagues may ask where we go from here.  One of the issues to be addressed is the clearing of obsolete, irrelevant and outdated legislation from after 1922.  The work of statute law revision will continue, as it has since 2003, and what we are doing today is with the support of the House accepting another phase of this much-needed reform.  We are setting out a very clear example to other countries about the way in which we have gone about our work in this area.  It has been painstaking, deliberative, and academically important work, but it also has a direct application to business, the professions and the country in general.  We must ensure the public&rsquo;s understanding of law is made easier.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity speak to the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012.  When we considered this before, I may have spoken on the legislation at a committee, but we are discussing this under the hat of public expenditure and reform.  The Minister wrote to members of the Opposition on 29 May seeking agreement to put this Bill through in one sitting.  We agreed to the request and we will do everything to facilitate the smooth and quick passage of the Bill this morning.  Although there will not be detailed discussion, I may have a question or two which I hope the Minister of State can answer.  If he cannot do so immediately, he might do me the courtesy of sending the reply by letter.</P>
        <P>There are 200 pages of Acts to be repealed and retained and I have focused on examples referring not to County Laois but Queen&rsquo;s County, the former name of Laois.  I have a few questions relating to the area referred to as Queen&rsquo;s County.  Some time ago I pushed for changes in legislation so that land and title documents in both Laois and Offaly would be referred to in the Land Registry as County Laois and County Offaly.  When I came to this House, all the title deeds in Laois referred to the Queen&rsquo;s County and that was on the title when I got my mortgage.  It could still be on that document.  It was the same for Offaly, which was referred to as King&rsquo;s County.</P>
        <P>There is nothing anti-British in repealing old British legislation.  We are tidying up legislation and I am sure Britain is doing the same.  The Bill continues what the Minister of State rightly describes as the cleaning up process in the Statute Book, repealing Acts which no longer have a purpose or relevance in the modern Irish legal system.  The Bill addresses local and personal Acts, as well as private Acts; the public would not be aware of such legislation and the Minister of State, in his speech, has explained them.  I was surprised to see how many issues concerned divorces, settlements, setting up estates and dowries etc.  We only have the titles of the legislation but we can make assumptions about what is behind some of them.  Naturalisation Acts would have dealt with people coming from other countries to this area, for example.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to clarify and simplify the Irish Statute Book by repealing Acts which no longer have a purpose or relevance in the modern Irish legal system.  Some 2,983 statutes have been identified as suitable for such repeal.  The legislation also provides for a comprehensive list of statutes that will continue to have force after the passing of the Bill, with 796 statutes identified as such and listed in the Schedules.  There is amendment of the Adaptation of the Enactments Act 1922 to provide for automatic adaptation of the pre-1801 legislation, with the power to make further changes by order.  The Bill deals with local and personal Acts between 1851 and 1922 and private Acts between 1751 and 1922.  That is the gist of what we are doing.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has given a comprehensive explanation and I have only one question on it.  I will not hold up business if he cannot reply but it is well and good if he can do so.  The Minister of State indicated there are a number of reasons it is undesirable for spent or obsolete legislation to remain on the Statute Book and that in simple terms, it is misleading for users who may believe that solely by virtue of an Act remaining on the Statute Book that it retains some modern effect or relevance.  What does that mean?  The Minister of State has indicated that some Acts remain on the Statute Book and they may have some modern effect or relevance.  Will the Minister of State clarify this, and specifically how it relates to the Queen&rsquo;s County?</P>
        <P>The Bill is extraordinary, with a Long Title on one page, several sections over the next three pages and 200 pages devoted to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The bread and butter of the Bill is in the Schedules.  Schedule 1 lists Acts that are specifically retained, although there are not many of them.  The first of them refers to County Tyrone.  Why Tyrone?  It is not part of our jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>As I move down through the other legislation, we can understand why some of it cannot be repealed, such as that relating to Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital in Westmeath &mdash; Wilson&rsquo;s Hospital is still there.  Reading further, there is a list of Irish Private Acts to be retained and it reads &ldquo;Vesting certain lands, etc. in the Queen&rsquo;s County formerly the estate of Dudly Alexander Sidney Cosby, late Lord Sidney, deceased, in trustees for raising money sufficient to discharge incumbrances affecting same, and other purposes; and to enable the several persons entitled thereto to make building leases of part thereof&rdquo;, and it is now to be called the Sidney Estate Act.  When I see the reference to Cosby, it can only be the Cosby estate, in Stradbally, County Laois, the venue of the Electric Picnic each year.  If I said we are dealing with legislation to protect the Electric Picnic site for future years, people would understand why we are not repealing everything.  If that Act was repealed, there might be a question about the Electric Picnic.  That family is still there, we all know them locally; they are a well respected family with a fine estate used for vintage car and steam rallies as well as the Electric Picnic.  It is interesting to see that reference to County Laois.  I agree it should not be repealed because that family is still <i>in situ</i> in that estate.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2 outlines those Acts that are specifically being repealed.  Page 87 of the Bill includes the Act &ldquo;Enabling John Preston, Esquire, for the considerations therein mentioned, to charge his estates in County Meath, and Queen&rsquo;s County with a further sum for payment of debts&rdquo;, which is obviously to levy rates on the people who lived on the estate.  That is one of hundreds of such Acts.  Over the page there is a further reference to John Preston and his estates in County Meath and the Queen&rsquo;s County, which we all know as County Laois.  These Acts are of value as curiosities because they were enacted in 1773 and 1774 and they are now being repealed.  The Act I mentioned relating to the Sidney estate was passed in 1783 and the house is still in fine condition.  I would not like to see anything done by repealing that Act that would have implications for the house.</P>
        <P>I will not be tabling any amendments on Committee or Reports Stages so maybe we will not be here for too long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>This Bill marks the completion of important work by the Attorney General and associated staff.  I acknowledge the final review of the primary legislation enacted prior to Independence has taken almost a decade to complete, although there is still a lot to do.</P>
        <P>As a historian I have a huge interest in delving into each of these Acts to discover why some of the divorce proceedings happened in the way they did and to consider the changes brought about by the railways.  I perused the titles and the staff are lucky that on this side of the House we did not ask for copies of each Act because some of it would only be found in Westminster.  It could be a job for a historian in the future, or even for the Attorney General and those who took part in the project, to undertake a history of the work behind this Bill and the problems that arose.  Here we are in Ireland so many years after the independence of the State and we did not have access to some of the laws that were still in force today.  As a republican, I have always been bemused that it has taken successive Governments so long to deal with that legacy, considering it was one of the issues that had been identified very early in the War of Independence and the foundation of the State, that we had to deal with this legacy and either repeal the legislation or restate legislation that still needed to be in effect in the State.</P>
        <P>It is a good day and hopefully in future we will deal with some of the other flaws the Minister of State mentioned.  He mentioned in his speech there are 2,116 Acts still in force that predate Independence.  It would be interesting to look at those Acts at some stage in future to see why we are not repealing them now and examine their impact.  We know the effects of the Acts listed in this Bill and previous Acts relating to statute law.  We had fun looking at the titles of some of the Acts, their effects and how bizarre some of them were in terms of modern parliamentary procedure and legislation.  What took up parliamentary time so long ago?  They show the history of the parliamentary system and how practices have changed.</P>
        <P>I do not question the enthusiasm of the interns who were used on this project but I have a problem with the use of internships in this fashion.  Interns should be used but this whole process hinged on their work because the project had been stalled for a number of years due to the embargo on staff recruitment and cuts to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  To ensure the project was not stalled for too long, interns were used rather than employing staff and ensuring all work was continuous.  The interns are now finished but the project is not yet complete.  Hopefully the valuable experience they gained might make them suitable for recruitment by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in future to finish some of the work outstanding in statute law revision.</P>
        <P>The work is to be commended.  Work still needs to be done on the Statute Book, particularly its full codification, so it is fully accessible.  Businesses, parliamentarians and the public should have quick and easy access to the laws that govern our State.  If we look at this legislation, the Acts involved are full of archaic language.  Even today, the legislation we publish is not in plain English.  If I was to hand a Bill to someone outside the Houses who had no expertise in legislation, he would find it very difficult to understand; it is gobbledygook to most people.  In some ways that is deliberate, with the law being used by lawyers, barristers and solicitors to keep the public out and ensure they are the only people able to extrapolate the intent of legislation.  The 2,000 Acts that were in place before Independence and all of the legislation passed by the State since then should be restated in simple language.</P>
        <P>While the Minister of State has read the Nice treaty, he probably has not read the reader friendly edition which was published by the Dutch MEP Jens-Peter Bonde and which I have recommended to others as an example.  EU law is difficult to follow at the best of times, but he collated all of the documentation relating to the treaty. The book provides on one page the explanation of what each section in the treaty means, as well as the deletions and insertions relating to previous treaties and other documents and the explanations on the opposite page, which makes it easier to track the changes.  I have suggested something like this would be a better tool for us when dealing with legislation, particularly on the social welfare code.  One has to bounce back and forth between the principal Act passed years ago and various amending Acts passed in the meantime and it is difficult to follow the legislative trail when amendments are being made to the code.  That is also a project that needs to be considered to make everything easier for us and the public which is taking a greater interest in how Parliament works.  That is why there are so many tours every day.  People want to learn about how legislation is processed because they are mystified as to why it is so complex, but we have made it complex through the mechanisms we use.</P>
        <P>I speak as Gaeilge in the House from time to time and have made demands regarding legislation.  One is that Bills should be published at the same time in Irish and English and Members should have the facility to table amendments in both languages.  The Gaeltacht Bill was published earlier this week in both languages and I presume that if I table amendments in both languages, they will be accepted, whereas in the past that was not possible.  Not all of the legislation passed since the foundation of the State is available as Gaeilge.  I wonder how many of the 2,116 Acts are not available in Irish because any of them could be challenged in the courts.  The fact that they remain on the Statute Book means they have implications for today&rsquo;s society.  I urge the Minister of State to examine this issue.  I am not trying to overburden the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, but these projects are vital.  I acknowledge that they take years; for example, it took ten years to complete the project that led to this legislation.  While they cannot be rushed, once we know work is being done and progress made, most reasonable people will accept this.</P>
        <P>I refer to another example of how legislation can be difficult to find.  When the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010 was being taken in the House, many said it would address many of the inequalities experienced by some family formations, in particular same sex couples.  Towards the end of the debate Marriage Equality demonstrated that the legislation did not address a significant range of rights, responsibilities and obligations that flowed from marriage.  Hundreds of these remain to be addressed to ensure equality between various family formations which some people do not want to have addressed.  They do not want to recognise that there should be marriage equality, but some of these rights were not captured in the Act because this is a complex legal area.  However, they need to be captured to address shortfalls in the legislation.  This has arisen because some of the legislation in this area is archaic and not available.  I hope we will come back to the issue of marriage equality and that legislation will be introduced.  Marriage Equality has highlighted 169 legal points of difference covering rights and protection across a range of legislation, including family law, immigration, housing, court procedures, inheritance taxation, freedom of information and other miscellaneous provisions, that can apply to married heterosexual couples but not to same sex couples registered as civil partners.  If we are to examine this issue properly, we need all of the relevant legislation in front of us.  This group has done this work and it is an example of how difficult legislation can be.  While we cannot rush legislation sometimes, in some cases, we have to wait years for the necessary legislation to address problems.  We are happy for some progress to be made, but once it is made, we need to ensure the completion of changes.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and, as an Irish republican, the repeal of any British Act of Parliament.  It is a pity the Act of Union and similar Acts are not being fully repealed in this legislation, although some other provisions have been in the past.  I refer to ground rents.  I presume some of the 2,116 Acts still give some rights to landlords who were never in or who are no longer in the State.  I would be willing to help in whatever way possible to go through the legislation to put together a Bill to repeal the Acts which force Irish people who own their homes to pay ground rent to somebody they have never seen or heard from other than through a threatening letter from a legal company based in England.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Bill, as it gives us the opportunity to continue the process of cleaning up the Statute Book by repealing Acts which no longer have purpose or relevance in the modern Irish legal system.  It also gives us the opportunity to debate the relevance of the legal system which urgently needs to be reformed.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and every day we witness the flaws in the justice system.  We must accept the people are not happy with it and want action, change and reform.  For example, sentencing policy urgently needs to be reformed.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board my views.</P>
        <P>In recent days light sentences were handed down in cases involving murder, attacks, violence and intimidation, while a small businessman, Mr. Paul Begley, was sentenced to six years in prison on a tax issue, even though he had paid the penalties.  I have been asked where is the justice, logic and fairness in the legal system.  This man employed 200 people.  He was involved in something, but he put up his hands and paid the penalties.  Giving a man six years for such an offence is appalling.  It is one of the most appalling miscarriages of natural justice I can recall for many years.  It has disappeared off the radar, but I am raising the case now.  The judge made an example of Mr. Begley to warn others not to mess with the State coffers.  In reality, he did not swindle the taxpayer, a fact not sufficiently highlighted at the time.  The garlic tax is a protectionist levy aimed at safeguarding Europe&rsquo;s garlic growers against Chinese imports.</P>
        <P>Most of the moneys raised by this tax go straight into the European Union budget, with the State retaining 25% to cover collection costs.  Mr. Begley&rsquo;s sentence came in the wake of a landmark ruling in February this year by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of a man jailed for 12 years for social welfare fraud.  That ruling offered future sentencing guidelines to the effect that significant and systematic frauds perpetrated upon the public revenue should generally be met with immediate and appreciable custodial sentences.  In other words, this particular case served as a warning that anybody engaged in such activity should expect a harsh penalty.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am fully supportive of a justice system which ensures that the person who does the crime will do the time.  However, the imposition of a six-year sentence in Mr. Begley&rsquo;s case, at a cost to the State of some &euro;100,000 per year, is not logical.  Instead of being imprisoned at enormous expense to taxpayers, that individual should have been made to repay the tax and perhaps given community service.  To clarify, I am not saying he should not be prosecuted for what he did, but the sentencing is out of proportion to the crime.  I am approached regularly by families in my constituency who are living in fear because of the intimidation exercised by gangs and organised criminals in their neighbourhoods.  There are people being assaulted by their teenaged children who are too intimidated to take any action.  We must examine the broader issue of how the justice system is letting citizens down.  An ex-member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na expressed the view to me recently that many judges are dissatisfied in their work as a consequence of the recent controversies concerning their salaries.  These individuals are, he claimed, trying to make life difficult for the Government and for politicians.  I hope that is not the case because it would be appalling.</P>
        <P>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of ground rents.  The law in that regard is connected to this country&rsquo;s imperial past and should no longer be tolerated.  I strongly support ACRA and the National Association of Tenant Organisations in their campaign to abolish ground rents.  That issue should be included in the broader debate on legislative reform.</P>
        <P>The legislation before us sets out a comprehensive list of statutes which will continue to have force after the passing of the Bill.  The Statute Law Revision Act 2009 repealed obsolete local and personal Acts enacted prior to 1851 and private statutes enacted prior to 1751.  This Bill will repeal all remaining obsolete local, personal and private Acts enacted prior to independence in 1922.  The two key words to consider here are &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;, and we must take an approach that is radical but sensible at the same time.  I welcome the efforts towards statute reform, but the overriding concern must always be the imperative to ensure our laws are based on principles of justice and equality.  An important focus in this regard should be a justice system which respects human rights.  At the same time, there must be strong support for victims of crime.  That issue seems to have gone off the agenda of late and the only people speaking out are the victims themselves.  The Government must get its act together, up its game, end the waffle and take action.  The justice system must be reflective of the laws of the land and the rights of citizens.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has been in operation for more than a decade and there are long-standing proposals that the moneys confiscated from organised criminals should go back into disadvantaged communities.  The late Tony Gregory was the first to make that proposal.  I take this opportunity to call for the new bridge over the River Liffey to be named for Mr. Gregory as a mark of respect for his work to combat disadvantage and inequality.  The Minister of State should have a word with Big Phil when he comes back from Rio de Janeiro, Colombia or wherever he is with a view to ensuring that is done.</P>
        <P>I conclude by stating my intention to support the Bill.  Its purpose is to clarify and simplify the Statute Book, thus making it easier to locate statutes and ascertain relevant law.  It does so by repealing Acts that are no longer of purpose, providing a comprehensive list of statutes and amending the Adaptation of Enactments Act 1922 to provide for automatic adaptation for pre-1801 statutes.  The Bill also deals with local and personal Acts enacted between 1851 and 1922 and private Acts enacted between 1751 and 1922.  A great deal of background work has gone into the legislation, with 22,855 statutes analysed as part of the revision exercise.  I take this opportunity to thank all of the public servants involved in this important work, particularly those with legal expertise.  The current fashion is to bash civil servants, so it is important to commend them on this impressive achievement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>As Deputy Finian McGrath and others observed, a great deal of work has gone into this legislation.  We are at the cusp of a series of centenary celebrations culminating in the centenary of the foundation of the State.  We will probably still be dealing with some of the legacy legislation in 2022.  Going through legislation like this obliges one to consider the types of issues that were dealt with by Parliament in the 19th century and earlier.  These laws were being made against the backdrop of the industrial revolution and we see many stock companies listed, for example, in a manner which is no longer appropriate.  A great deal of legal and institutional changes have taken place in the past century which have seen great change in the activities and operation of Parliament.  For instance, we have statutes here which name specific divorces and naturalisations.  It is difficult to comprehend that such matters were part of routine parliamentary business in the past.</P>
        <P>One should also bear in mind that the parliamentarians who enacted these laws were not elected by universal suffrage.  Rather, they were men of property elected by other men of property, many of them from urban centres.  As such, there is a fascinating historical perspective to this, with parliamentary concerns reflecting the social strata from which Members were drawn.  A significant portion of the legislation included here deals with issues relating to the railway companies.  Throughout the middle and latter part of the 19th century the development of the railway network attracted a large share of public and private investment.  We can see the fragmented approach to that development, with gauge widths differing in different parts of the country.  I was interested to read about a Member from Athlone who was also heavily involved in the Midland Great Western Railway company and a substantial landowner.  He succeeded in having his project proceed at the expense of the Great Southern and Western Railway company.  The expectation at the time was that Galway would become a hub of transatlantic travel and a doorway to the New World.  It took a major job of reconfiguration to address that error after the railway systems were amalgamated.  Unfortunately, this type of fragmented approach followed over into other realms of activity and was not exclusive to the development of railway services.  That fragmented approach is still evident today.  We could learn some lessons that it is not the way to do things.</P>
        <P>The two large cemeteries in Dublin, Mount Jerome and Glasnevin, were stock companies.  That would come as a surprise to people as would the references in the Bill to the Bank of Bolton Limited, the Kent and Surrey Permanent Benefit Building Society and the Buenos Ayres and Ensenda Port Company Limited.  It is right that we should repeal the quite extraordinary range of Acts.  When I read the Bill, I focused more on what was being retained.  I suppose there are good and residual reasons for the retention of legislation.</P>
        <P>We are looking at the legacy we inherited but we must consider the legacy we will leave in terms of the way we enact legislation because very often it is a bit fragmented.  Consolidating legislation is important.  We should take a housekeeping approach to legislation because we will leave a huge body of work to others if we do not routinely do things which will make it easier and more intelligible for people in future.  We might learn that lesson from this legislation, which will pass very comfortably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
        <P>The Statute Law Revision Bill is very interesting and made entertaining reading.  One sees some historical things, which one does not see anymore, and one could spend a lot of time going back over all the Acts mentioned.  This Bill is more than an essential exercise in repealing outdated legislation prior to Independence in 1922 and ensures the law helps rather than hinders citizens.  It also provides a fascinating glimpse into the historical motives and objectives of the legislative process while containing dozens of Acts of Parliament relating to County Galway, or I should say Galway and south Mayo.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanKyne"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne</NameTxt>
        <P>We will worry about our own areas.</P>
        <P>More than a dozen Acts directly relating to Galway have been deemed to have outlived their usefulness and will be repealed with the passing of this Bill.  However, more than a dozen more are being retained because future plans are dependent on them.</P>
        <P>The Bill specifically retains Acts on which future legislation or proposals will be built or on which legal rulings have relied.  For example, the retention of the Galway, Oughterard and Clifden Railway Acts 1872 and 1875 is necessary because of the planned greenway along the now disused railway.  The original legislation contains legal points on land ownership and rights of way which will be vital to the successful implementation of the new greenway.</P>
        <P>In hindsight, the decision to close this railway was most regrettable.  It would be one of the most scenic rail journeys in the world if operating today.  Going through the heart of beautiful Connemara, it would have been a godsend for tourism and especially for the town of Clifden.  However, the tourism potential can be realised by the construction of the greenway along the old railway line put in place by the Acts, which we are retaining in this Bill.  A 2.5 m wide tarmacadam surfaced walking and cycling route from Oughterard to Clifden is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la under strategic infrastructure planning.  The plans will be decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la from mid-October to early November.  The construction will result in a tourist route similar to the Westport to Mulranny line which has brought huge numbers of cycling tourists to Mayo.  The plans for that will extend from Galway city to Oughterard and through my own area of Moycullen.  It is interesting that these plans relate to Acts dating back to 1875 and the construction of the railway line.</P>
        <P>Other relevant Acts relating to Galway which are being retained include the Athenry and Tuam Railway Acts 1858 to 1865.  These Acts will be relevant to the plans to proceed with the re-establishment of a western rail corridor, the first phase of which has been implemented from Limerick to Athenry.  Also being retained is legislation pertaining to Galway harbour and port, the Galway commissioners waterworks and the Corrib river among others.</P>
        <P>There are great plans for the development of a new port in Galway city.  The Volvo Ocean Race, which will be held from the end of June to early July, will be a huge boost to tourism in Galway city and county, although I hope the weather will improve.  There is a large energetic team behind this project.  A container ship arrived in Galway docks during the week with the tented village which will be erected to house the dignitaries and everybody else who will come along to the festivities.</P>
        <P>The major plans for the development of a new port in Galway city, which will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la during the year, will allow cruise liners and large ships to come into the heart of Galway city.  The docks in Galway city are in the heart of the city, unlike those in other cities.  It is interesting to see the related Acts being retained under this Bill.</P>
        <P>A further examination of the Bill reveals how our legislative system has changed.  Legislation being repealed includes Acts of Parliament passed to facilitate divorces, which were always sought by men as divorce law was heavily skewed in their favour, to confer citizenship, to change names and to sort matters concerning wills, estates and debts.  It is clear that parliamentary Acts and the legislative process was once the preserve of the wealthy and well-connected and used for the most personal and individual of reasons but it has gradually transformed into a process for the benefit of all citizens.  That the Statute Law Revision Bill is repealing narrow, individualistic Acts but retaining those of benefit to communities, towns and cities confirms this.</P>
        <P>The Bill and the legislation being repealed provide a historical perspective on the nature of laws in the past.  For example, narrowly focused laws were enacted for individuals, most likely the privileged and wealthy.  Nowadays law should be for the common and greater good rather than for individuals.  The Bill is an exercise in ensuring laws are up to date and I welcome its publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
        <P>I very much welcome this Bill and the Minister of State.  As Deputy Kyne mentioned, the way laws were enacted in the past is interesting.  This is the third in a series of Bills following a comprehensive review of legislation enacted by the House of Commons between 1750 and 6 December 1922.  I noted the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening comments regarding retrieving the original documents.  It is a pity that such a major act of vandalism, namely, the occupation of the Four Courts complex, caused so much damage to our public records.  Unfortunately, records were lost which is a great pity.  The destruction of Acts or genealogical records was a personal and historical tragedy.  We, and future generations, will have to live with that loss and shame.</P>
        <P>There is a wealth of our history in this legislation, which we should put on the record.  Much of this Bill has to with the repeal of Acts dealing with the local, personal and private Acts of Parliament dealing with naturalisation, dissolution of marriage and dissolution of trusts.  The local Acts mainly concern railway orders, harbour orders, the creation of townships, patents and railway orders.  A few of these Acts caught my attention and intrigued me as a legislator and I wish to highlight some of them.</P>
        <P>The Munster Bank (Limited) Liquidation Act 1887, which is it proposed to repeal, involved the liquidation of the Munster Bank.  On researching this, I came across an exchange in Hansard involving a question asked by Mr. Parnell:</P>
        <P LI="1">MR. PARNELL asked Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, in view of the monetary situation created in Ireland by suspension of payment on the part of the Munster Bank, and considering that the Bank of Ireland enjoys special facilities under the Law, and exceptional advantages from the Government, and has at its disposal unused note-issue power to the extent of above a million sterling, whether the Government will use its influence to cause the Bank of Ireland to assist the Munster Bank to recover its position, and thus avoid liquidation, if the different classes of persons interested in this Bank as depositors and shareholders should undertake to do their part, and the affairs of the Bank should be found in a condition to warrant assistance from the Bank of Ireland?</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied:</P>
        <P LI="1">The hon. Member has asked me a Question to which I could not give an affirmative reply without the risk of raising hopes which, so far as I see, could not be realized; but I may say that, in my opinion, the exceptional position of the Bank of Ireland entails upon it at times such as these special duties, and I have good reason to believe that this is recognized by the Directors of the Bank, and that they are ready to help in promoting the very desirable object referred to by the hon. Member, so far as may be possible consistently with due regard to the safety of the Bank.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to what taxed or influenced the Members in the House of Commons in 1887, it is a case of <i>Plus &ccedil;a change, plus c&rsquo;est la m&ecirc;me chose</i>.</P>
        <P>Another Act of note was the Edward, Pamela and Lucy Fitzgerald (children of Lord Edward Fitzgerald): restoration of blood Act.  It was intriguing.  The next that caught my attention was the Archbishop of Dublin&rsquo;s estate: enabling the demise of the mansion house of Tallaght (Dublin) Act.  The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, Euseby Cleaver, was, prior to his death in December 1819, found to be of unsound mind and his functions were discharged by the Archbishop of Cashel.  I must assume the Act was to tidy up matters relating to his will and affairs.  These examples show the way legislation and methods of legislation have evolved.  There used to be very personal and narrow Acts involving families and individuals and now the focus is on the common good.  It demonstrates how politics may have changed and how the greater good and common good must be privileged over clientelism in decision making.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an interesting and timely document to clean up the Statute Book.  It is no harm reminding people how legislation was pursued over the past 200 or 300 years in the House of Commons, the Grattan Parliament and in this country up to 1922.  I welcome the tidying up of the statutes and discussing them in the Chamber.</P>

        <P>Ta &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  Is fada muid ag pl&eacute; leis an gceist seo.  Thug an Rialtas roimhe seo f&uacute;ithi, agus rinne an t-Ard Aighne ag an am go leor oibre uirthi.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go leanfar leis seo agus go gcr&iacute;ochn&oacute;far an pr&oacute;iseas.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ceart go mbeadh aon dl&iacute; i bhfeidhm in &Eacute;irinn a hachta&iacute;odh roimh 1922.  Go deimhin, t&aacute; go leor dlithe a hachta&iacute;odh tar &eacute;is 1922 ar cheart iad a aisghairm de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an mBille.  Beidh m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go ndearbh&oacute;idh an tAire go leanfar leis an obair seo go dt&iacute; go mbeidh gach aon cheann des na sean Achtanna seo aisghairmthe agus go mbeidh Leabhar Reachta&iacute;ochta ag an St&aacute;t a bhaineann leis an am a raibh ceannas ag muintir na h&Eacute;ireann ar a gcuid reachta&iacute;ochta f&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>I have been a great supporter of this process since it started.  It is better late than never.  It was monumental to decide that all pre-Independence legislation should be systematically repealed and that all the rules and laws that govern us should be those made by an Irish Oireachtas for the Irish people.  The task has been very long and complicated and it is not yet completed.  I am sure the Minister of State will now admit that much meritorious work was talking place under the radar and that fundamental decisions were being made that will never receive much coverage in the media.  I hope the Minister of State will accept that this was one of the major decisions made by the previous Government and that it will have a lasting effect.</P>
        <P>The basic idea and ultimate aim is that no statute should stand in this country that has not been enacted by the Oireachtas.  Ensuring that all the laws are made by an Irish Parliament, Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, for the Irish people represents a consummation of Independence in the legal sense.  There is still a long way to go and it requires resources, time and commitment.  We have devoted considerable time and effort to this process.  There will be those who will say the legislation is not urgent.  Practically and conceptually, this is an incredibly important process.  I hope the Government is as committed as its predecessor to completing this task.  I hope that, in the next few years, we will be able to say the task is completed.  When the process is completed, we will have to eliminate post-Independence legislation that is no longer relevant.  There is also a very important practical element.</P>
        <P>Many years ago, when I was on the board of Gael Linn, the organisation had to deal with oyster bed rights in Connemara.  The late D&oacute;nal &Oacute; M&oacute;r&aacute;in was drawing on 15th century law &mdash; he may have been going back further but I cannot remember the details &mdash; to try to establish the rights of Gael Linn to the oyster beds.  He did win in the court.  That was my first understanding of the fact that one could draw on legislation from the mists of time and perhaps establish some rights on finding some dusty parchment.  I am thankful that in the case in question, in which I had a small part as a member of the board, the rights to the oyster beds, having been established by Gael Linn, were bought by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It, in turn, gave the beds to a local co-operative to manage.  The project has been very successful since.  The problems that plagued Gael Linn when it owned the oyster beds were miraculously solved when the local people became the custodians of the property.</P>
        <P>This matter brought home to me the legal difficulty that arises in the courts from having legislation from the mists of time.  Resources can be wasted trying to make arguments on the basis of such legislation.  It would be great if one could say to somebody that no law before 1922 has any relevance because it has been repealed.  One would only have to look at the finite Statute Book, containing a proper copy of every Act passed by Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann to decide on a legal position.</P>
        <P>I kept asking the previous Attorney General whether an ancient Act on cuffs and wigs in the courts would be repealed.  I have not had time to do research to determine whether that archaic legislation was repealed in full.  A court is more like a drama setting than a court of a modern, independent state if judges and barristers are dressed in ancient garb and wearing horsehair wigs.  Instead of adding to the status and solemnity of the courts, wandering around the Four Courts in horsehair wigs and sitting in judgment on people while wearing 18th century garb is more likely to result in derision and the alienation from the upper legal system of many people who are not familiar with the courts.  Eoin MacNeill, a Cumann na nGaedhael Minister and grandfather of former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, did some work on replacing the horse-hair wigs in the 1920s with some more suitable head attire.  I regret that he did not manage to see that legislation through because it is one piece of archaic Ireland that we could do without.  The heritage of the wigs would be better in a museum than in the courts of a modern state.  They are a little incompatible with the iPhone, the laptop etc.  However, this is important legislation.  It is important that we are making this progress.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what my colleague, Deputy Kyne, had to say about the Acts not being repealed.  Specifically, he mentioned the legislation on the Galway to Clifden railway line.  I am delighted he is so in favour of the greenway because I was the one who, as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, first promoted the idea of using abandoned and disused railway lines, both those in State ownership and those where the land had been sold back to the people, as cycle-walk ways.  What was done between Westport and Achill is an example of good practice.  I have been a long time trying to encourage the Donegal people to do the railway line along the Barnesmore Gap and the people in Kerry to do the one that goes out in such spectacular fashion along the road to Cahirciveen, where one sees the line of the railway up on the side of the mountain, where one would have a spectacular view and where most of the railway line itself is intact.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  As I stated, t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre agus t&aacute; t&uacute;s maith curtha leis an obair seo.  Rinne an Rialtas deireanach go leor oibre air seo agus cuid mhaith den obair at&aacute;&aacute; pl&eacute; againn inniu obair an Rialtais dheireanaigh at&aacute; ann, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go leanfaidh an Rialtas nua leis seo.  T&aacute; t&uacute;s maith curtha leis an obair ach go dt&iacute; go gcr&iacute;ochn&oacute;far &iacute;, go dt&iacute; go mbeidh deireadh leis an reachta&iacute;ocht dheireanach a bhaineann leis an tr&eacute;imhse roimh 1922, n&iacute; bheidh mise s&aacute;sta mar creidim gur cheart gur reachta&iacute;ocht &Eacute;ireannach a bheadh mar bhun&uacute;s reachta&iacute;ochta do phobal na h&Eacute;ireann, agus n&iacute; reachta&iacute;ocht a achta&iacute;odh ag seanpharlaimint&iacute; in &Eacute;irinn n&oacute; thall sa Bhreatain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ReginaDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Regina Doherty</NameTxt>
        <P>I am sharing time with Deputy John Paul Phelan.</P>
        <P>The Statute Law Revision Bill will repeal all spent or obsolete local and personal Acts enacted between 1851 and 1922 and private Acts enacted between 1751 and 1922.</P>
        <P>In historical terms, regulatory reform and the need to make laws accessible for those affected by them dates back to the development of the civilised society.  Until 1922, Ireland was part of Britain and the United Kingdom and this historical connection has resulted in the inheritance of a very different regulatory system than the one we have today.  When the State was established in 1922, Article 73 of the 1922 Constitution carried over the laws that applied in Ireland up to that date and Article 50 of the 1937 Constitution contained a similar provision.  The State did not begin life with a blank legislative canvas but carried over virtually all of the pre-1922 laws that had been put in place up until that time.</P>
        <P>Between the 1920s and the 1950s, a certain amount of reform of the laws in Ireland occurred but there was no systematic approach to the issue and the need for reform has long been acknowledged as an important part of public policy.  The Bill is the next step in the most extensive statute law revision measure that has ever been undertaken in the State.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been considered by all Departments, local authorities and relevant companies, bodies and organisations.  I particularly pay tribute to all the officials in a number of Departments who have been working extremely hard on revising the statute law in this area for a long time.</P>
        <P>At the publication of the Bill, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, stated that it is the most extensive statute law revision ever attempted anywhere in the world and puts Ireland in a leadership position internationally in terms of the management and updating of the Statute Book.  If we take it with previous Acts, this legislation will result in the removal of almost 8,000 obsolete Acts enacted before Irish independence in 1922.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the statute law revision project was established to conduct an analysis of, and consult on, statutes which may be appropriate for appeal.  This project, which was set up within the Office of the Attorney General, was set the lengthy task of reviewing all legislation on the Statute Book to identify which was spent or obsolete.</P>
        <P>The statute law revision project engaged in wide-ranging analysis of all legislation of the various Irish, English, British and United Kingdom parliaments which exercised authority over Ireland prior to Ireland achieving her independence as well as all legislation passed since 1922.  The project identified approximately 63,000 statutes which came within its remit for examination.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the enactment of this Bill, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to move on to review pre-independence secondary legislation and to examine the substantial number of charters and statutory rules passed prior to 1922, but this Bill is merely another phase of that work.</P>
        <P>The Schedule to this Bill contains lists of both the Acts specifically repealed and also those that will be retained.  Those being repealed in this tranche include a large number of private and local and personal Acts relating to land transfers, conferring of citizenship, setting up of institutions, divorces etc.  In addition, the Bill specifies approximately 790 pieces of old legislation, which are still relevant and which are being specifically kept in force.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the extraordinary work that has been done to ensure we modernise, codify and bring up to date the legislative code before the foundation of the State.  Up-to-date legislation that is easily accessible and comprehensible to the public is as essential a part of the basic infrastructure of society as a road network or reliable telecommunications system.  This initiative firmly places Ireland as an international leader in terms of the management and updating of the Statute Book, and I commend it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am glad to have a few moments to speak on the Statue Law Revision Bill 2012 and to commend the work of the officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who were belonging to a different Department, I assume the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, until the new Department was created a year ago.</P>
        <P>As somebody who has been a legislator for ten years and a student of law for four years, I am a bit nerdy about matters such as this.  It is fascinating to read and learn about the amount of legislation that has been passed by different parliaments that have had jurisdiction over what we know today as the Republic of Ireland over more than 250 years.  It is a fascinating area of study, and fascinating to think that 60,000 pieces of legislation have been reviewed from the period prior to independence and that this Bill, along with three or four previous Acts that have been passed, mostly in the past decade, is the fruition of that work.  I commend the officials who were involved in the drafting of this particular piece of legislation.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Regina Doherty outlined, when the State was created, it is clear, certainly from this legislation if one did not know previously, that we did not start with a blank canvas when it came to legislation governing all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>One of the most interesting things about this Bill is the notion of private Acts of parliament, which do not exist in this jurisdiction nowadays.  Before much of the main body of current company law came into existence, most companies were brought about through Acts of parliament, in those days Acts of the House of Commons in Westminster.  This was prior to the establishment of company law currently in existence.  Much of the legislation being repealed relates to private Acts from 1751 until 1922 and local and personal Acts from 1851 until 1922.  I understand 40,000 Acts were considered and the Bill repeals almost 10,000 of them.  Some private and personal Acts which pre-date Independence will remain on the Statute Book.  Many of these contain archaic nuggets of interesting historical information.  The debate pack provides a number of examples, including an Act passed in 1877 to legislate for how St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green was to be maintained and managed.  It is appropriate that some of this historical legislation, such as that concerning the maintenance of public facilities, including St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, be maintained.</P>
        <P>It is crucial in terms of company law and the manner in which business is done that Acts of Parliament are codified, reviewed and, where necessary, repealed.  For this reason, I wholeheartedly support this welcome legislation.  I also commend the efforts of the officials involved who have completed a major task in bringing this legislation to fruition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012, which deals with a large number of archaic Acts of Parliament.  Similar legislation revising statute was enacted in 2009 and there have been other such Acts over the years.</P>
        <P>I echo Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s comment that considerable work had been done in this area in recent years.  I urge the Government to continue this work and remove as many archaic Acts as possible from the Statute Book.  As a modern country, we should not need to have legislation passed in the 18th or 19th century on our Statute Book.  Ireland has been independent since 1922 and it would be more convenient for the general public and solicitors, barristers and those engaged in legal studies if we were to have a comprehensive Statute Book covering all legislation passed since the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>Many of the 40,000 Acts on the Statute Book are private and officials are to be commended on proposing in this Bill to remove 10,000 of them.  This is no small piece of work and I commend them on their laborious, time consuming endeavours behind the scenes and hidden from the glare of the House.  They deserve our thanks and praise and I wish them well as they study the remaining 30,000 Acts with a view to making the Statute Book more relevant to citizens.</P>
        <P>I note a 1761 Bill was introduced for the purpose of &ldquo;vesting certain lands etc. situate in County Tipperary, the estate of Philip Percival, Esquire, in trustees, in order that same may be sold for payment of debts and incumbrances affecting same, and also the estate of said Philip, situate in County Sligo;&rdquo;.  This refers to the Earl of Tipperary selling Irish land to raise moneys to pay off his debts.  It is timely that legislation of this nature is removed from the Statute Book.  In Clonmel, Cappoquin, Carrick-on-Suir and many other areas people still pay ground rents and in some cases must obtain permission from so-called lords before vesting certain property, taking out probate or engaging in similar activities.   My area had many such lords, most of whom are deceased.  Some of them were good people, for example, Lord Doneraile, who was a neighbour of mine, was always a good man to deal with.  Nevertheless, that people are still beholden to such people is archaic.  This should have gone out with the flood and certainly with the gaining of independence.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to making the workings of the Law Library and Four Courts relevant to ordinary people.  I have been arguing for years for the introduction of refresher courses for judges.  Unless a judge is impeached &mdash; fortunately this is seldom required &mdash; he or she will remain a judge for life.  Times have changed and the courts must become more user friendly places for all citizens, whether they are called for jury duty, must appear as a witness or to answer a charge or choose to visit the courts out of curiosity and interest.  Having gowned and wigged gentlemen and ladies playing around with laptops and so forth in the courts is archaic and nonsensical.  It is time we copped on and got rid of this last vestige of the British Empire.  We should abandon the use of gowns and wigs and the charade that goes with it and come down to the level of ordinary people.  People need to have faith in the system of justice.  We should help them feel comfortable in their surroundings when in court.  It is bad enough to encounter the eerie silence of court chambers.  I have been arguing for years that the proceedings of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court should be held in a much softer environment, as is the case with some of the family courts.  Reform is needed in this area.</P>
        <P>We need to repeal more archaic Acts of Parliament.  As was noted, a number of Ministers tried to address this issue over the years with some degree of success.  We need to go further because justice must be for everybody and everyone must feel at ease in places where the law and justice are administered.</P>
        <P>There are so many private statutes that one could use the list as bedtime reading.  It is interesting to note the various issues they address.  For example, an Act of 1783-84 was introduced for the purpose of &ldquo;vesting in trustees certain lands and tenements, the estate of Francis Mathew, Esquire, of Thomastown, in County Tipperary&rdquo;.  Last Monday evening, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, visited Athassal Abbey, a wonderful old Cistercian monastery close to Thomastown.  Much history, architecture and archaeology is associated with the abbey and those present heard a wonderful discussion.  We should strive to have this part of rich heritage preserved and ensure it looks it best.  I am delighted the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, is present.  Perhaps he will visit Athassal Abbey with his colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, at some stage.  Local landowners are amenable to allowing the OPW have a car park and walk at the site.  Some negotiations would be required beforehand.</P>
        <P>Pre-1922 Acts of Parliament, on the other hand, are the type of heritage we must get rid of.  We should repeal these Acts and cherish and enjoy instead our heritage and rich cultural diversity.  We do not want to retain archaic statutes dating from the era of the British Empire and Cromwellian times when we were given the choice of hell or Connacht.   This should all have been taken with them when they went.  We have our own destiny and we should ensure that some of these dastardly Acts get repealed.  I wish the Bill speedy passage through the House, along with the other 30,000 Acts and I commend the work of the officials in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill, which is the third in a series of initiatives that have been taken in respect of statutory revision.  Statutes are not proposed for repeal on the basis alone that they are old or on the basis alone that they are British.  They are proposed for repeal because a judgment has been formed that they have become spent, obsolete or otherwise unnecessary.  As I understand it, no statutes are being proposed for repeal if their repeal would give rise to a loss of rights and entitlements an individual might conceivably have.  The criteria applied to a decision on whether to repeal are very important.</P>
        <P>I join others in congratulating the people who have been involved in this process.  A really impressive body of work has been done on behalf of the State.  However, it is ultimately a matter for the Parliament &mdash; not even the Government &mdash; to decide on legislation, including the repeal of legislation.  We rely on the judgment that has been applied to these statutes by people who have done the technical work and have advised us in the Parliament that these statutes are obsolete and have no further application.  For example, one major criterion on deciding to repeal these statutes is their applicability to Ireland.  If the statute does not have applicability to Ireland, then almost by definition it is obsolete.  That would seem to be an unanswerable argument for repeal, but other criteria to be applied might tend towards the area of a value judgment.  That is where great care needs to be taken as to whether it is right to have a particular law or not.  If such judgments were being applied to this exercise, I would be very concerned.  It seems that a much narrower technical function has been exercised.  It is important that the Minister of State touched on that.  He might confirm in his concluding remarks that we are not being asked to do certain things.  We have not looked through the hundreds of statutes in this Bill.  We are taking our job seriously, but somebody might conceivably ask us if we looked at all those statutes to check on what we were repealing.  We are relying on the judgment that has been exercised, and I am happy to rely on it.</P>
        <P>Statutes are not repealed just because they are old or just because they are British.  This notion of archaic laws is thrown around.  Many old laws are good laws.  It is not bad law because it is old.  Some laws endure for a great period of time, because they are regarded as rational laws.  Just because a law is old does not of itself mean that it is bad.  We made a conscious decision in 1937, when the people approved the Constitution, to continue to give effect to laws that were already on the Statute Book.  That was a very important thing and we did the same thing in 1922.  For those who ask when are going to clear away all this British stuff from before 1922, I remind colleagues that the people made a conscious decision not to do so, and to continue in effect with laws that existed previously.  We did this for very good reason, because many basic things could not have worked in the country if we did not do so, but also because many of the laws were still rational laws for us, notwithstanding the fact that we were independent with our own Government.  Laws related to how services were managed, provided and so on, and these, as well as basic laws of the land about offences against the person, were rational laws that we carried into the new State.  Professor John Kelly, a predecessor of mine in Dublin South &mdash; I notice it disappeared today &mdash; made that point in very strong terms in his monumental work on the Constitution.  He said that the old Article 73 in the Free State Constitution was generally taken to be the vehicle on which the whole corpus of law used in Ireland was carried across the constitutional divide and formally continued in force in the new State.  It was a conscious decision made by us as a new State to do this.  The same principle prevailed in 1937 for the laws that were passed between 1922 and 1937.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is not self-evident that it was necessary to do this.  My view is that it is correct to do it, but there seems to have been a difference of opinion going by some of the judgments in the High Court and the Supreme Court over the years as to whether laws would just fall into disuse.  In the case of State <i>v. </i>O&rsquo;Dea in 1986, Mr. Justice Keane spoke about the provisions of section 8 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851, which prevented the District Court from sitting in a building where spirituous or fermented liquors are sold.  He said that the section had fallen into a limbo of disuse and therefore was inoperative, as it belonged to the vanished world of grand juries, county sessions and presentment sessions.  In that case, the judge seemed to be saying that the law has fallen into disuse and nothing really needs to be done about it.  He implied that the laws are old, they are dusty and nobody cares about them anymore, so there is no need for this kind of exercise we are engaging in now.  That was one view.  Another view was expressed in Nova Media Services Limited <i>v. </i>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by Mr. Justice Murphy in 1984.  He made the point that the Government is probably relying upon in this exercise.  He stated that a statute cannot wither away from lack of use and cannot be repealed, waived, or abandoned by the express decision or agreement of the Executive.  That confirms the view that the laws do not just wither away on the vine and that we have to repeal them if we want them gone.  We cannot just leave them there.  That is the legal context in which we are engaging with this work.</P>
        <P>I think the better view is that we should be proactive about this and that we should not just have this view that if they are lying around the place, they are not doing any harm.  Let us have a look at it and let us have this cleansing exercise in our Statute Book.  That is a useful exercise.  However, I must emphasise that it is for the Parliament to do this.  We need to be satisfied &mdash; I think we are satisfied &mdash; that the analysis being done to assist us has been rigorous and has not strayed beyond a relatively narrow frame of reference, which is whether the statutes have any applicability any more.  They are obsolete in the sense that they are &ldquo;dead letter&rdquo;, or devoid of meaning or effect.  That must be the criterion applied, rather than a broader value judgment which would peculiarly be a matter for us.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said in his speech that this would help the legal profession.  There are not too many people out there who worry much about helping the legal profession.  Perhaps it would help the legal profession.  As a legal practitioner as well as a legislator, I can say that the most important thing for legal research is cataloguing.  We often have an image of lawyers ploughing through book after book.</P>
        <P>It actually tends not to work in that way.  If there is a good cataloguing and library system, which we tend to have, in place, one can usually find what one is seeking relatively quickly.  I am not sure if it is going to have a huge effect, one way or the other, in the legal profession.  We are not doing this for that profession, rather we are doing it in order to have clarity in the Statute Book.  What we are doing makes great sense.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh on a particular point which has often occurred to me on previous occasions.  The Deputy&rsquo;s point relates to what happens when the House or its select committees deal with complex legislation.  Let us consider, for example, the position on amending legislation.  Such legislation usually amends a principal Act, to which one is obliged to refer back.  In addition, there may be two or three other statutes that are relevant to the work one is doing.  It is quite a job for any legislator to ensure he or she tracks down all of the material relevant to an item of legislation that is being amended.  I do not say what I am about to suggest could be done easily or quickly and I accept that there would certainly be a cost involved.  However, I ask the Minister of State to consider whether, at some point in the not too distant future, we might change the way we do business in the Houses when dealing with legislation.  In other words, our work would not just be paper based; we could have quick on-line access to principal Acts, other statutes and relevant amendments.  This would allow us to do our work better on behalf of the people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan</NameTxt>
        <P>The basic concept of law is that it must be recognised as having relevance to those to whom it applies.  The Statute Law Revision Bill seeks to address a problem which has become apparent in the context of statutes which apply to a bygone age, which deal with events long since past and which fail to have any relevance to modern society or social interaction.  The law, like everything else, must evolve to meet the changing needs of society or else it will become irrelevant.  What the Bill seeks to address is the debris which was discarded as the process of evolution to which I refer kept pace with social change but which was allowed to remain on the Statute Book.  Some of the statutes involved were enacted to address individual circumstances such as the break up of an estate, the winding up of a particular dynasty, etc.  This is not how we legislate today, nor has it any relevance to a modern common law system.</P>
        <P>It is correct that we should discard obsolete statutes, most of which date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, in order to tidy the Statute Book and bring it up to date.  I find it incredible that of the almost 3,800 statutes deal with in the Bill, almost 3,000 are suitable for repeal.  It appears that this particular bout of spring cleaning is both long overdue and underlines the obvious need for exercises of this nature to be conducted on a basis more frequent than the current bicentennial rota.  The Law Reform Commission does the State quite a service in maintaining a watchful eye on this area and is suitably disposed to conducting the necessary reviews.  The commission is seen by legislators, the people and the Judiciary as efficient and impartial and acting in all our interests.  One can only imagine the size of the task involved in undertaking such a comprehensive review to lay the foundations for the introduction of the Bill which has been designed to bring order to a system the roots of which stretch far back into our history, while preserving those items which continue to have relevance.  In that context, I refer, for example, to the Simpson&rsquo;s Hospital Estate Act 1779 which established an institution that is still in place.</P>
        <P>The positive outcomes that will emanate from the passing of this legislation will include a more efficient keeping of statutes, resulting in a reduction of the time spent on research as a result of the removal of obsolete items.  The presentation of a modern and efficient Statute Book would definitely cast a more favourable light on our system for those engaged in inward investment.  A greatly reduced Statute Book would be capable of delivering a more efficient system and this can only be a plus.  Nothing in the Bill diminishes the rights of individuals and it should, therefore, be roundly welcomed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank all 14 colleagues who contributed to the debate.  I also thank them for outlining their considered views on this important legislation.  It is not every day that the Oireachtas effectively makes redundant approximately 23,000 individual items of law which date back to a previous age.  Historically, this is an important day for the House.</P>
        <P>I take the point made by Deputy Alex White to the effect that this is a decision for the Parliament.  Each Act passed by this and the Upper House is an instrument in respect of which all Members must make a determination.  I confirm for the Deputy and others that the entire process relating to statute law revision is based on judging what is and is not relevant and what is and is not obsolete.  It is not based on whether an Act was passed prior to independence.  As the Deputy correctly stated, various items of legislation still have meaning and retain their applicability.  This is not, therefore, a cultural legacy difficulty with which we are dealing, rather it is an exercise in assigning applicability to law and ensuring it has relevance.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that some of the legislation involved must remain in place.  Of the 60,000 or so Acts passed prior to independence, some 2,116 are being retained because they have applicability, meaning and relevance.  It would be utterly wrong to infer that all laws passed before independence are illegitimate, incorrect or wrong merely on foot of the fact that they were enacted under the British regime.  It would be a travesty to make such an inference.  Many of these laws were right, had applicability and were relevant to the periods in which they were introduced.  In so far as they have meaning today, a number of the laws to which I refer are being retained.  Their retention is largely down to the team that has been working on this matter since 2003.</P>
        <P>It is important to state the parliamentary tradition has a long history in this country, be it on the British side or, since 1922, on the Irish side.  Ireland is the fourth oldest parliamentary democracy in Europe and, thankfully, did not go the way of embracing fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.  One of the reasons for it remaining a democracy during the latter period is the parliamentary tradition.  That tradition continued even after independence and it is extremely important.  Many of the procedures in place before the country became independent have been retained.  Many such procedures which were copied from Westminster continue to be applicable in this House.  This is a result of their durability and strength and also due to the way in which parliamentary values have been inculcated into wider Irish society.  We do not need to throw out all of this because much of it is both good and important.</P>
        <P>The process in which we are involved has been ongoing since 2003.  The Bill is the fourth item of legislation of its kind and has been worked on for the past 18 months.  As I pointed out when introducing it, we are going to proceed with the next phase of our review in order that we might modernise the law.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh has correctly pointed out that in the context of the legislation we pass, we must be mindful of the language we use and its applicability.  Other colleagues referred to the need for consolidation.  It is absolutely the case that in order to make legislation understandable, it must be readable, in the first instance, but it must also be codified in such a way as to allow people to view the law in its entirety.  As colleagues are aware, that is not the case.   When reading social welfare or finance Bills, one would need a catalogue of previous Acts available in order to make what is proposed understandable.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh made his point forcefully in the context of the civil partnership legislation, in respect of which many changes relating to many aspects of law are required.  It would be better if we were to arrive at a position where legislation was codified and that is a matter of which we are mindful and on which successive Governments have been working.  The Statute Law Revision Acts of 2007 and 2009 and this Bill set out, in their Schedules, the pre-1922 legislation that is continuing in force.  Instead of having 60,000 Acts, we will have a comparatively small number setting out the Acts that are retained.  For the first time we know the modern applicability of those Acts because they will be set out in the Schedules.</P>
        <P>The mandate given to the statute law revision project was to keep Acts wholly if they have relevance.  If an Act has 100 sections and ten of them are applicable, the entire Act will be kept.  Acts that are wholly of no relevance are being, effectively, deleted from the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>Members have queried the applicability of the 2,116 Acts.  The Dublin Fire Brigade, for example, was established by an Act in 1862.  Are we suggesting that Act should go?  No, we are not.  The establishment of the Dublin Fire Brigade, a core function of the service provided in the city, is still relevant.  The Coroners Courts were established by Acts of 1876, which make provision for the maintenance of the Coroners Courts.  We are not going to throw that legislation out, because it is still applicable today.  Deputy Fleming and others referred to the Railway Acts.  The lines the Deputy mentioned are still in place.  The legislation was good at the time and remains good now.  Following the clean-up operation that has occurred, we will have a clear picture of more than 2,000 Acts that are applicable.</P>
        <P>Our mandate is clear.  We only knock out an entire Act if all of its sections are irrelevant.  Where some sections of an Act have relevance, it remains on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>When the State was established, everything that went before was not obliterated from Irish historiography in some kind of cultural revolution.  Previous legislation remained on the Statute Book by virtue of Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann.  Furthermore, Article 50 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states that laws in force in Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;shall continue to be of full force and effect&rdquo;.  When we accepted the Constitution of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann and Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann we accepted, implicitly, the 60,000 pre-1922 Acts.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, as Deputy White said, we have been looking at those Acts and their applicability and relevance to modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fleming asked about Queens County.  If the printed version of an Act says &ldquo;King&rsquo;s County&rdquo; or &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s County&rdquo; it is an historical fact that they were called that at the time.  Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke about legacy.  We must work in the context of what was enacted at the time.  Those names do not have applicability today but we cannot obliterate them, as though there had been a cultural revolution.  I hope that is clear.</P>
        <P>Deputy Fleming also referred to an Act listed in Schedule 1 which refers to Tyrone.  I understand the Act concerns lands in County Louth, although Tyrone is mentioned in the subject matter.</P>
        <P>The use of interns was questioned.  Significant work was done on this project for a considerable length of time.  People obtained huge experience.  Their involvement in the process has been to our advantage and theirs.  Some Deputies were critical of the fact that interns were involved.  Legal researchers and people with a particular knowledge of historical legislation were also involved.  This is a cumulative piece of work involving many different people across Departments.</P>
        <P>I thank colleagues for the cross-party support for the legislation and for the considered views expressed.  This is not the end of the process.  It continues.  I assure the House of the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue this work in the lifetime of the Government and to recognise the work of the previous Government in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues with Deputies.  For more than five decades, the Government has pursued a policy of complete opposition to nuclear weapons and in this has enjoyed strong cross-party political support in this House.  This support has been important in enabling successive Ministers and officials to speak out strongly on issues important to us in international fora.  I believe it is both appropriate and timely that, as the states parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty enter the treaty&rsquo;s 2015 review cycle, the House should be enabled to consider and discuss Ireland&rsquo;s position and role within wider international efforts to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, and that I should set out some of the challenges currently facing those efforts.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a long and distinguished record in multilateral efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.  In 1958, just three years after we were admitted to the United Nations, Minister Frank Aiken tabled the first of the so-called &ldquo;Irish resolutions&rdquo; in the UN General Assembly.  These paved the way directly for the discussions which ultimately produced the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT.  The treaty remains at the heart of international efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons to this day.  It contains the only international legal obligation to disarm nuclear weapons and it is a cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.  This was no mean achievement for a small, fledgling UN member state seeking to promote nuclear non-proliferation at the height of the Cold War arms race.  Ireland&rsquo;s pioneering role in the NPT process was subsequently recognised when we were invited to become the treaty&rsquo;s first signatory.  We were the first country to sign and ratify it, and we have been associated by name with it ever since.</P>
        <P>The lasting achievement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been to diminish the spectre of nuclear war.  The so-called &ldquo;bargain&rdquo;&rsquo; at the heart of the treaty requires the nuclear-weapon states to undertake to disarm their nuclear weapons, in return for which all other states agree to forgo nuclear weapons.  All states are granted the right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, subject to verification.</P>
        <P>While it is crucial that the treaty is implemented in full across all three of its pillars &mdash; disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses &mdash; I must say, with regret, that progress in implementing its disarmament objectives has been much slower than progress under the two other pillars.  I see this as being among the first challenges facing the NPT.  The treaty&rsquo;s obligation to disarm is now more than 40 years old.  If there were ever factors justifying the retention of large nuclear deterrents during the Cold War &mdash; there were not &mdash; these surely ceased to apply when the Cold War ended.  However, even with the dissipation of Cold War tensions and with the indefinite extension of the treaty, progress on disarmament stagnated.  In 2000, states parties agreed 13 practical steps towards accelerating nuclear disarmament.  Ireland and her New Agenda Coalition partners, for whom disarmament is a key priority, played a central role in this regard.  These steps were subsequently reaffirmed at the 2010 NPT review conference, but for the most part they remain unimplemented.</P>
        <P>As we enter the 2015 NPT review cycle, it is estimated that more than 23,000 nuclear weapons remain in place.  For as long as these weapons continue to exist, the threat which they pose to humanity will remain.  If they are perceived to carry a political or tactical benefit, or even &mdash; for some &mdash; a sense of prestige, they will encourage proliferation and non-compliance with international obligations.  It is of great concern that, long after the end of the Cold War, the old concept of deterrence is cited as a justification for retaining and, as we read this week, modernising arsenals.</P>
        <P>In terms of establishing the foundations for success at the 2015 NPT review conference, Ireland will be among those states looking to the nuclear-weapon states to build confidence that they are seriously and in good faith fulfilling their obligation to achieve the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals.  They are legally obliged to do this by Article VI of the treaty, applying the principles of irreversibility, verifiability and enhanced transparency as they proceed.  It is undoubtedly the case that progress towards complete disarmament will strengthen in turn the treaty&rsquo;s non-proliferation objectives, as any possible incentive for joining &ldquo;the club&rdquo; is reduced and eventually removed.  As the 2015 review cycle progresses, we will therefore be looking for progress reports from the nuclear-weapon states along the way, particularly in 2014, by which date they have committed themselves to report to the wider NPT membership on progress.</P>
        <P>There are a number of serious challenges to what the nuclear non-proliferation treaty seeks to achieve.  First among these is the fact that three countries remain outside the treaty and are not, therefore, bound by its basic disarmament and non-proliferation imperatives.  Two of those countries, India and Pakistan, are regional neighbours with a history of rivalry and dispute.  Both are nuclear-capable states working to develop their missile capability.</P>
        <P>The third non-NPT state, Israel, is presumed by many to possess a nuclear arsenal, although it maintains a policy of opacity in this regard and has never declared itself to possess nuclear weapons.  Israel has claimed on a number of occasions that it faces an existential threat from its regional neighbours.  In the case of two of these neighbours, Iran and Syria, many questions have been raised regarding their compliance with the NPT and their co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.  Iran claims that it is entitled to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  However, as I have made clear in this House on several occasions, in asserting that right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy Iran must comply fully with its NPT commitments.  It must co-operate fully with the IAEA to resolve all outstanding matters on its nuclear programme.  It must also comply with successive resolutions of the agency&rsquo;s board of governors and the United Nations&rsquo; Security Council on this matter.  By the same token, Syria must comply fully with its IAEA safeguards agreement and with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</P>
        <P>Both of these situations, in south Asia and in the Middle East, remain of considerable concern.  They represent significant challenges to international peace and security.  Ireland will continue to call upon all three states not yet party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to sign and ratify the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states, and to enter into a full scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  We will continue to support international efforts to ensure compliance by all NPT states with their international obligations including, where necessary, through sanctions.</P>
        <P>In addition to these situations, a fourth state &mdash; the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, DPRK, or North Korea, remains of grave concern.  In 2003 the DPRK announced that it was walking away from its NPT commitments.  Since then it has conducted a number of nuclear explosives and missile tests.  I strongly call on the authorities in Pyongyang to come back into full NPT and IAEA compliance and to desist from any further nuclear explosive or missile testing.  The importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, system as a means of verifying the nuclear activities of member states and of ensuring minimum standards of safety and security cannot be understated.  The terrible accident at Fukushima last year demonstrated that nuclear accidents do not respect borders and nuclear safety is a concern for all.  The inherent dangers in a nuclear device falling into the hands of non-state actors are self-evident.  The House may be assured we will continue to use every opportunity to support the agency in its work.</P>
        <P>These are not the only challenges facing the international non-proliferation regime.  More than 15 years after it opened for signature, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT, is not yet in force.  The treaty prohibits all nuclear weapons test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, and thereby impedes the development and qualitative improvement of these weapons and the technological advancement of new types of nuclear weapons.  It must enter into force without further delay.  The provocative nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea in 2006 and 2009 clearly demonstrate that there is an urgent need for such a treaty.</P>
        <P>To enter into force, all 44 countries listed in annex 2 to the CTBT must sign and ratify the treaty.  These are the countries that were recognised as being nuclear-capable at the time of the treaty&rsquo;s negotiation.  So far, 36 have ratified.  Ireland has repeatedly called on all states, but particularly the remaining eight annex 2 states, to sign and ratify without further delay so as to achieve the treaty&rsquo;s entry into force.  The United States has an important leadership role to play in this regard and I welcome the pledges by President Obama&rsquo;s Administration to pursue early entry into force.  Ratification by the United States as one of the annex 2 states yet to ratify would encourage ratifications by others.  In the meantime, the treaty acts as a strong international bulwark against nuclear test explosions.  I expect the international community to react firmly in response to any such explosion.</P>
        <P>A crucial element of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization, CTBTO, is its international monitoring system, which offers an effective global verification system.  The system is participatory and therefore non-discriminatory.  It provides credible assurances of compliance and will also help in seismic and tsunami warning, as demonstrated during the tragic nuclear accident in Fukushima last year.  I commend the progress achieved to date in the build-up of this verification regime and I stress the need to continue working towards its early completion.</P>
        <P>In this respect, I am delighted that tomorrow morning I will be opening Ireland&rsquo;s CTBTO national data centre at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies along with Dr. Lassina Zerbo of the organisation&rsquo;s international data centre division.  This reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s strong and long-standing support for the treaty and represents another step in the build-up of the international monitoring system.</P>
        <P>Since Ireland joined the Conference on Disarmament in 1999, the conference has been paralysed by its own rules of procedure.  A rule whereby all decisions must be taken by consensus has created an effective right of veto.  This cannot continue.  Among the proposed programme of work is a treaty that would ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.  Negotiations on such a treaty are long overdue and must begin at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>With so many security challenges facing us, we cannot allow the world&rsquo;s main disarmament negotiation body to become a by-word for institutional and policy failure.  We are willing to examine a range of proposals and issues to assist the conference in getting back to work.  These include the issue of its membership, its ties with civil society and its internal procedures.  If the Conference on Disarmament cannot agree and implement a programme of work, the wider UN membership in the General Assembly will need to assume its responsibility to act.  It would be deeply damaging to the UN and multilateralism if the current state of affairs were allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>Having set out some of the challenges facing us as we strive towards a world free of nuclear efforts, I would like to set out some recent positive developments.  The first concerns ongoing efforts towards a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, WMDs, and their delivery systems.  The 1995 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, review and extension conference adopted a Middle East resolution that called for the establishment of a zone free of WMDs.  It was part of a package deal that also included the indefinite extension of the treaty.  Progress towards its implementation has been seen, therefore, particularly by Arab states, as important in terms of the treaty&rsquo;s viability.  Ireland sees progress on the Middle East resolution as a key objective.  At the 2010 NPT review conference, we brokered agreement on a text that emphasised the importance of a process leading to full implementation of the 1995 resolution and set out a number of practical steps, including the convening of a conference in 2012.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a conference facilitator and a host government for the 2012 conference was announced in October 2011.  Finland will host and the Finnish Under-Secretary of State for foreign and security policy, Mr. Jaakko Laajava, will act as facilitator.  Mr. Laajava has not yet announced dates or other details for the conference.  He is still consulting intensively with interested stakeholders, both within the region and beyond.  Ireland strongly supports the facilitator in his work.  Officials from my Department have given him detailed briefings on our experience of the process that led to the 2010 agreement.  We have indicated that we remain at his disposal.</P>
        <P>There is now a fair measure of understanding of what is required to achieve a WMD-free zone in the Middle East.  Despite the non-universality of the treaty, I believe the 1995 resolution contains most of the fundamental elements.  What we need now is political will, both inside and outside the region, to take the process forward.  The recent history of this island has shown that accommodation is possible, even on those issues that have been long regarded as intractable.  What is important is that there is a willingness on all sides to engage constructively in a collaborative process moving forward.</P>
        <P>I want to finish by referring to efforts towards a nuclear weapons convention.  A number of Deputies would be supportive of such a convention.  In October 2008, UN Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon suggested that NPT states could &ldquo;consider negotiating a nuclear weapons convention, backed by a strong system of verification, as has long been proposed at the United Nations.&rdquo;  Ireland has always been a strong supporter of complete nuclear disarmament.  We support the objective of a nuclear weapons convention and the commencement of collective preparatory work in this direction.</P>
        <P>However, given the current level of opposition to a convention &mdash; as many as 50 states are regarded as either sceptical or lukewarm and four out of five of the nuclear weapons states are opposed &mdash; we do not anticipate agreement being reached on a convention in the short term.  Article VI of the NPT is the only legally binding multilateral commitment by the nuclear weapons states to disarm their arsenals.  We are keen to protect this while remaining supportive of the idea of a convention.</P>
        <P>Action 5 of the disarmament plan set out in the 2010 NPT review conference final document commits the nuclear weapons states to &ldquo;accelerate concrete progress&rdquo; on nuclear disarmament and to report in 2014.  It is important that this be implemented.  Work to achieve both objectives &mdash; full NPT implementation and steps towards a convention &mdash; should be mutually reinforcing.  They should not distract from achieving implementation of agreed commitments by the nuclear weapons states.  The 2015 review conference will take stock of progress and consider the next appropriate steps.  This could, of course, encompass a nuclear weapons convention.</P>
        <P>Much has been achieved by the NPT and the disarmament and non-proliferation regime built around it.  However, we are still a considerable distance from where we all would like to be, that is, in a world free of nuclear weapons.  It is important that the international community continue with this crucial work, which was launched by Frank Aiken in the late 1950s and which has given Ireland special prominence in the international efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons.  I assure the House that this will remain a top priority for the Government and I thank the House for its consistent support in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, which is set against the backdrop of an unenvisaged crisis of gargantuan proportions in the European economic and financial situation.  It is appropriate that we would take time to consider the other major challenges facing the world community.  I understand from the Government Whips that Deputy Eoghan Murphy has been pushing for a debate on this issue.  I commend him, as this is an appropriate debate.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a proud history of fighting to stem the prospect of nuclear proliferation across the globe.  In the past 50 years, we have played a leading role in developing international agreements to reduce and eliminate the grave threat that nuclear weapons pose to the future of humanity.  Under Taoiseach &Eacute;amon de Valera, Ireland developed a distinctive and positive foreign policy position that carved out a niche for us in world affairs as a strong, consistent advocate of nuclear disarmament.  Looking back upon our work, we can see the role that we have played.  We have the potential and moral obligation to continue to strive towards disarmament.</P>
        <P>In November 1959 the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, a man who had seen the devastation of war first hand in Ireland in the War of Independence and the Civil War, first proposed an international agreement to halt the increase in the number of nations with nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal of achieving eventual complete disarmament.  The United Nations General Assembly adopted the proposal in Resolution 1380 (XIV) which suggested:</P>
        <P LI="1">That the ten-nation disarmament committee should consider appropriate means whereby this danger may be averted, including the feasibility of an international agreement, subject to inspection and control, whereby the powers producing nuclear weapons would refrain from handing over control of such weapons to any nation not possessing them and whereby the powers not possessing such weapons would refrain from manufacturing them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is these very principles that should continue to inform our foreign policy on nuclear proliferation today.  The next year, again by the initiative and ongoing hard work of Mr. Frank Aiken, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 1576 (XV) that called on the countries with nuclear weapons to voluntarily halt the proliferation of such devices.  In 1961 the assembly adopted a further two resolutions, the first of which was Resolution 1664 initiated by Sweden about the conditions of the agreement.  The second was Resolution 1665 (XVI), yet another Irish initiative led by Mr. Frank Aiken, to put the onus on those states with nuclear weapons to conclude an agreement.</P>
        <P>In 1962 the world was brought to the precipice of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis.  The spectre of mass devastation at a single stroke was never as real and present as it was during the strained moments in October 1962.  This serves as a reminder to us all of how fragile our world is in the nuclear age.</P>
        <P>Moving on from that crucible of danger, Ireland continued to work towards establishing a framework to avert such future crisis points.  On 1 July 1968 we witnessed the fruits of the labour of Irish foreign policy when, at separate ceremonies in London, Moscow and New York, representatives from 62 nations signed the treaty.  Today 189 countries are party to the treaty, with four notable exceptions, India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea.  The first three never ratified the treaty, whereas North Korea ratified it in 1985 but later withdrew.</P>
        <P>More recently, Ireland played a prominent role at the 2010 review conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  We undertook a strong role in the positive outcome of that conference in seeking significant achievements in nuclear disarmament that has been a key policy priority for successive Governments across the party spectrum.  It is important that we recognise the staff of the disarmament and non-proliferation unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  They have played a leading part in driving forward achievements at the conference and deserve credit for their work.</P>
        <P>The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is a major achievement of Irish foreign policy.  It should remain the cornerstone of our efforts to play a positive role across the globe.  The three pillars underpinning the treaty &mdash; nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses &mdash; are the key principles of Irish policy in this area and enjoy cross-party support.  Looking at the problems that assail the world today and the continued prospect of nuclear arms spreading, much work still needs to be done.  The growing prospect of Iran having nuclear ballistic capability is a major concern for the international community.  I have had several discussions in committee with Iranian representatives who are adamant they are not involved in the production of weapons of mass destruction.  However, they have a major job to do to convince the international community of this.</P>
        <P>The Middle East is a tinder box of geopolitical tension.  The volatility of the area sends ripples across the globe through shocks to the price of oil and the ongoing threat of terrorism.  The immensely destabilising impact of the emergence of another nuclear power in the region, notably Iran, makes it highly dangerous.  With the Arab Spring transforming the region, adding the highly disruptive impact of nuclear capability to an already volatile situation could be potentially disastrous.</P>
        <P>At the 2010 conference Ireland&rsquo;s head of delegation, Ms Alison Kelly, chaired complex talks on the implementation of the 1995 Middle East resolution which called for an &ldquo;effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems&rdquo;.  This work needs to be focused on and emphasised.  The 2012 conference on implementation of the zone is of paramount importance as it takes on a renewed sense of urgency as negotiations with Iran stall and deteriorate.  The impact of EU sanctions on Iranian oil production from 1 July may help to spur progress, but the 20% uranium enrichment level reached by Iran brings the prospect of armed conflict closer.</P>
        <P>There is a strong argument against attacking Iran to avoid damaging Iranian retaliation and in view of the inability of an attack to do more than just delay Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme by a few years.  Beyond this, an attack seems likely to create irresistible pressures in Iran to do everything possible to obtain a nuclear option with a renewed sense of urgency, as well as to disrupt the West&rsquo;s interests wherever possible and spur proxy wars through the Hizbollah, Hamas and other terrorist groups across the globe.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the creation of a nuclear free zone in the Middle East through diplomatic means should be our priority.  The Department&rsquo;s nuclear non-proliferation unit is working with the facilitator of the 2012 conference and I trust the Minister is providing all help and experience from our own efforts in establishing a framework for brokering a deal and achieving real progress.</P>
        <P>A key outstanding issue is the nuclear capacity of Israel, with an estimated 200 nuclear weapons which it has never publicly recognised.  In this light, addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains central to addressing the existential concerns of Israel and its position in the Middle East.  Our broader work in this area towards a peaceful two-state solution should sap the latent political anger across the region that the conflict occasionally causes to explode.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Looking at the world&rsquo;s two major nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, it is important that the international community continue to exert influence in reducing and ultimately eliminating their nuclear arsenal.  The USA has approximately 2,200 deployed nuclear weapons, a massive reduction on the number at the height of the Cold War of 32,000, while Russia has 1,800 deployed warheads.  Behind the deployed numbers, Russia has a total of 10,000 nuclear weapons, while the USA has 8,000.  Despite the progress made for several years in the post-Cold War era, these numbers remain remarkably high.  Negotiating nuclear disarmament with Russia and the USA and ensuring it is a <i>quid pro quo</i> reduction should be facilitated by the international community.  The resetting of US-Russian relations under the US President, Mr. Obama, appears to have stalled with the re-election of the Russian President, Mr. Putin.  The European Union should play a role in ensuring a deterioration in relations does not lead to the sidelining of the nuclear disarmament agenda.</P>
        <P>In the late 1990s the Brookings Institute undertook an extensive study of how much money the United States had invested in developing its nuclear arsenal.  In 1998 $35 billion was spent by it on its nuclear weapons.  In a world racked by poverty, the value of moneys involved illustrates the moral need to switch our focus from developing weapons of mass destruction to more productive and humanitarian efforts.  Across the party political divide, we would all agree we need to see a move from armaments to nourishment.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money must be diverted to areas in which it can be compassionately, reasonably and productively used.</P>
        <P>Ireland can draw some strength and courage from its past work in this area.  We can take pride in our achievements but, more importantly, harden our resolve to build on these past successes.  The shadow of nuclear proliferation remains an existential threat to the future of humanity.  The unimaginable consequences of nuclear war and the potential for switching the sums of money spent on nuclear weapons to more productive work should continue to drive on the moral impetus behind our stance on nuclear non-proliferation.  Our past efforts show that our achievements were secured through close co-operation with a network of like-minded states and non-governmental organisations.</P>
        <P>It was accomplished in the face of considerable opposition from some powerful nations and shows that, sometimes at least, small countries can still achieve big things.  This attitude should continue to drive our efforts.  I hope the 2012 conference on a nuclear-free Middle East bears testament to that.</P>
        <P>It is important for us to have this useful debate, although it may have been better if we had thought about it on each side of the House and had a motion before us that we could all agree.  That would have sent a very strong message from the D&aacute;il to the world community that this country is completely committed to continuing its historic work towards a world free of the nuclear threat, and which places an emphasis on the value of humanity.  The moral perspective of the Irish people dictates that the money available should be spent on saving lives rather than plans to take life.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in the work he is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
        <P>I also commend Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is present, for proposing this important debate.  Ireland has been at the heart of this issue in the past and can be again if we choose to do so.  Ireland has a long and proud record on seeking to prevent nuclear proliferation.  In 1958, when Mr. Frank Aiken was Minister for External Affairs, Ireland proposed the first UN resolution which sought to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.  In 1961 the UN General Assembly unanimously approved an Irish resolution calling on all states, particularly the nuclear powers, to conclude an international agreement to refrain from transfer or acquisition of nuclear weapons.  In 1968, when the non-proliferation treaty, NPT, was open for signature, Ireland was invited to be the first to sign in recognition of the part that Ireland had played in the international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.</P>
        <P>The NPT has been a success and few people would deny that it has been an effective brake on nuclear proliferation.  Today, the NPT has 189 signatories with five of them &mdash; China, France, Russia, the UK and the US &mdash; as &ldquo;nuclear weapon&rdquo; states and the other 184 as &ldquo;non-nuclear weapon&rdquo; states.  Under Article IX(3) of the treaty, states that exploded a nuclear weapon before 1967 qualify as &ldquo;nuclear-weapon&rdquo; states and are allowed to keep their nuclear weapons for now but must disarm eventually.  Three states &mdash; India, Israel and Pakistan &mdash; refused to sign the NPT and secretly developed nuclear weapons.  As these states chose to remain outside the NPT, they did not breach any treaty obligations by doing so.  In addition, North Korea developed nuclear weapons while a party to the NPT but later withdrew from it.</P>
        <P>Today, more than two decades after the end of the Cold War, there are upwards of 20,000 nuclear warheads in the world, according to the Federation of American Scientists.  The vast bulk of these warheads are in the possession of the US and Russia, with approximately 5,000 warheads operational.  There is a long way to go to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons, which President Obama talked about in his speech in Prague in April 2009.</P>
        <P>Since the end of the Cold War, the US and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear stockpiles, and so has the UK.  However, it cannot be said that these or the other &ldquo;nuclear-weapon&rdquo; states have fulfilled their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the treaty.  This states, &ldquo;Each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.&rdquo;  None of the five states that possessed nuclear weapons before 1967 and were therefore allowed to join the NPT as &ldquo;nuclear-weapon&rdquo; states has disarmed.  All of them have still got nuclear weapons and have continuously modernised their systems.  There is no sign whatsoever of any of them giving up their nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>Is this fair to all those states that have signed up to the NPT as &ldquo;non-nuclear weapon&rdquo; states and undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons?  The five NPT members that possessed nuclear weapons in 1967 retain them despite their undertaking to engage in &ldquo;nuclear disarmament&rdquo;.  In addition, the NPT is not universal.  The three states of India, Israel and Pakistan have engaged in nuclear proliferation on a grand scale outside the NPT but they have not been subject to the kind of sanctions now being applied to Iran, which has no nuclear weapons.  It is true that all three states used to be in the international nuclear dog house in the sense that they were unable to purchase nuclear material and equipment from the rest of the world, which made it difficult for them to expand their civil nuclear programmes.  In July 2005, the Bush Administration signed the US-India nuclear agreement, an initiative which has lead to India being taken out of the dog house; it is now free to engage in international nuclear commerce while retaining and developing its nuclear weapons.  India has, in effect, become the world&rsquo;s sixth officially recognised nuclear power.</P>
        <P>As a member of the nuclear suppliers group, NSG, of states, Ireland played a small part in India&rsquo;s elevation.  On 6 September 2008, it consented to the amendment of the NSG guidelines to make an exception for India and allow that country alone to import nuclear material and equipment without all its nuclear facilities being subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection.  The NSG operates by consensus and theoretically Ireland could have prevented such an extraordinary anomaly being introduced into its guidelines but it did not.  Ironically, the NSG came into being in 1974 as a result of India developing and testing a nuclear device using plutonium from a reactor imported from Canada for civil purposes.</P>
        <P>The UK is currently upgrading its nuclear weapons and the Trident submarines to deliver them.  The new system is planned to provide the UK with an operational nuclear weapons capability until 2050 and beyond.  It is instructive to consider the arguments that have been made to justify the vast expenditure involved.  A White Paper published by the Labour Government in December 2006 asserted that the UK must have nuclear weapons &ldquo;to deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against our vital interests that cannot be countered by other means&rdquo;.  Last Monday, the UK Minister responsible for defence, Conservative MP Philip Hammond, told the House of Commons that &ldquo;The possession of a strategic nuclear deterrent has ensured this country&rsquo;s safety.  It ensured that we saw off the threat in the Cold War and it will ensure our security in the future.&rdquo;  On the same occasion, Labour MP Ms Alison Seabeck echoed Hammond, stating &ldquo;In a security landscape of few guarantees, our independent nuclear deterrent provides us with the ultimate insurance policy, strengthens our national security and increases our ability to achieve long-term global security aims.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I quote these arguments to show that it is very unlikely that Britain will ever give up its nuclear weapons, as it is supposed to do according to Article VI of the NPT.  The arguments used are relevant not just for today but arguably for all time.  British politicians will always be able to justify the continued possession of nuclear weapons &ldquo;to deter and prevent nuclear blackmail and acts of aggression against vital interests that cannot be countered by other means&rdquo;, and the same applies to every other nuclear weapons state.</P>
        <P>In one sense, nuclear weapons are &ldquo;the ultimate insurance policy&rdquo;; states that possess these are less likely to get attacked, at least by other states.  We can consider what has happened to the three states that President Bush declared to &ldquo;constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world&rdquo; in his 2002 state of the union address.  Iraq, which did not possess nuclear weapons, was invaded by the US and the UK in March 2003 and its regime was overthrown.  Iran, which does not possess nuclear weapons, is continuously threatened with military action by the US and Israel and may yet be attacked.  However, the US has not threatened to use force against North Korea because it has at least a rudimentary nuclear weapons system.</P>
        <P>When North Korea exploded a nuclear device in May 2009, after initial condemnation the country was invited to take part in further negotiations.  There is an important lesson there for states that do not possess nuclear weapons; if they want to be free from &ldquo;the threat or use of force&rdquo;, which is supposed to be prohibited by Article 2.4 of the UN Charter, if at all possible, they should get at least a rudimentary nuclear weapons system.</P>
        <P>I recommend to the T&aacute;naiste that he read the pamphlet issued by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, led by Mr. Roger Cole, a member of the Labour Party.  It was drawn up by Dr. David Morrison, a respected and eminent expert in the field, and offers some balanced comments on the situation in Iran and the Middle East.  It points out that the United States and its allies which claim they want to see the Middle East free from nuclear weapons are applying ferocious economic sanctions and threatening military action against Iran which has not got a single nuclear weapon and its nuclear facilities are open to IAEA inspections.  However, they are utterly opposed to applying sanctions to Israel, despite its possession of perhaps as many as 400 nuclear warheads and its the ability to deliver them by aircraft, ballistic missile and submarine-launched cruise missiles and wipe off the map any capital in the Middle East and probably much further afield and its nuclear facilities are almost entirely closed to the IAEA.  Far from sanctioning Israel, the United States gives it over $3 billion a year in military aid and, despite an enormous budget deficit, the amount has increased every year under the Obama Administration, as the President was at pains to emphasise in his speech to AIPAC on 4 March.  More US tax dollars go to Israel than to any other state.</P>
        <P>A double standard is being applied to Iran and Israel in this regard.  The United States and its allies frequently state that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, this will inevitably lead to the widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons the Middle East.  That, they state, is one of the reasons Iran must not be allowed to acquire them.  It is rarely mentioned that, because of Israel&rsquo;s acquisition of nuclear weapons, Iran and other states in the region would be within their rights to withdraw from the NPT and develop nuclear weapons as Israel which never signed the NPT has done without breaching international obligations.</P>
        <P>The Irish branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has pointed out that while Irish foreign policy has always strongly endorsed nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, this is not matched by Irish financial policies.  The National Pension Reserve Fund, according to its 2011 report, has investments of at least &euro;23 million in international arms companies which produce single use components for the nuclear weapons industry.  AIB which is in majority state ownership lent $28 million to an American company involved in the nuclear weapons industry in 2010.  Other countries which play a leading role in support of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament such as Norway and New Zealand prohibit the investment of state funds in companies involved in the nuclear weapons industry.  There is a similar ban in Ireland on investments in companies engaged in the landmine and cluster munitions industries but not in the nuclear weapons industry.</P>
        <P>Irish CND made six recommendations, which I endorse.  Ireland, despite the current economic difficulties, should continue to play a leading role in support of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  It should take a lead in working for a nuclear weapons convention, together with other like-minded states.  It should continue to support the processes and frameworks of the non-proliferation treaty but must be prepared to go beyond the NPT to address its weaknesses.  It should engage with NGOs such as the International Red Cross-Red Crescent and like-minded states to apply international humanitarian law to achieve a ban on nuclear weapons.  It should support a multilateral approach to easing the nuclear tensions in the Middle East.  It should ban investments in companies involved in the nuclear arms industry by State funds and financial institutions based in the State.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with the NPT is that while it has had a considerable impact in preventing the further proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction that pose an existential threat to the world, unbelievable double standards are at play.  The five NPT states that have nuclear weapons and are permitted to keep them &mdash; the permanent members of the UN Security Council &mdash; can prevent a real removal of these weapons.  As they hold a veto on the UN Security Council, there cannot be a UN Security Council resolution.  While these double standards are in place, it undermines our moral credibility when trying to engage with states we are trying to persuade not to develop nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>We were leaders in this process when it started and have a great deal of credibility in the field.  We still have neutral status, even though the use of Shannon Airport has undermined this.  We are respected by the various players, particularly now, and could make an intervention to assist the process with Iran.  We are respected by the United States and in Europe as honest brokers.  I would volunteer that we are also respected by Iran as honest brokers.  Could we not assist the process to reach its conclusion?  These are the opportunities and the Government has stated it would like to reinstate Ireland&rsquo;s global reputation.  We have a great reputation in the defence of human rights, in this field and overseas development.  We must reassert ourselves in these spaces and use the credibility and legacy we enjoy to address these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>In February I chaired a meeting when Ms Maria Gomez, a human rights activist from Bolivia, was in the country.  She campaigns with the Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament which has a membership of more than 800 parliamentarians from 80 countries.  This is an important movement for parliamentarians that provides information on nuclear disarmament issues and resolutions, motions and questions in parliaments around the globe.  It is an important forum for developing strategies on this topic.  It is good, therefore, that we are having this debate.</P>
        <P>In 2011 there was a call for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  There are examples of parliamentarians helping to establish nuclear weapon-free zones in Antarctica, Latin America, the Caribbean, the South Pacific and Africa.  These zones were difficult to achieve, particularly where countries were involved in nuclear testing.  The experience, however, is one of overcoming difficulties and the call is to develop security without nuclear weapons.  The Zimbabwean Minister for Education, Culture, Sports and Arts praised this initiative and saw what was achieved in Africa as a building block towards common security and a nuclear weapons-free world.  He made the point that the &euro;100 billion spent annually on nuclear weapons should instead be dedicated to addressing economic and social needs, including education, health, housing, jobs, water, food, fair policies on the environment and poverty reduction.</P>
        <P>There are other positive developments on this topic that give us an opportunity as legislators to be forceful.  International humanitarian law covers weaponry and prohibits the use of weapons or methods of warfare that cause indiscriminate harm to civilians, unnecessary suffering to combatants or long-term and severe damage to the environment.  We know this continues in spite of international humanitarian law; therefore, putting it on paper is one thing but implementing it is another.  It requires basic respect for law.</P>
        <P>Ireland played a significant role in the landmine and cluster munitions treaties.  The blueprint is in place with these initiatives for the achievement of a global treaty banning nuclear weapons.  Other positive moves in 2010 were the parties to the non-proliferation treaty coming to an agreement that all states must comply with applicable humanitarian law, including international law, and acknowledge that any use of nuclear weapons would cause catastrophic humanitarian consequences.  The NPT consensus final document called on all nuclear weapon states to undertake concrete disarmament efforts &mdash; the key word being &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; &mdash; towards establishing the necessary framework to establish and maintain a world without nuclear weapons.  The Vancouver Declaration, Law&rsquo;s Imperative for the Urgent Achievement of a Nuclear Weapon-Free World, following a conference of international law experts, was issued in February 2011.  In October 2011 leading NGOs launched a nuclear abolition forum to facilitate dialogue to bring this about.  Also, the International Red Cross-Red Crescent adopted a resolution on the irreconcilability of nuclear weapons and humanitarian law.  It is imperative that we continue to work towards an international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons that will be legally binding.</P>
        <P>It is also positive that more than three quarters of the world has voted in favour of the UN resolution calling for commencement of negotiations leading to the conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention.  This has support across a wide spectrum, including even from countries that possess such weapons.  Perhaps they are paying lip service to the notion but they have signed it anyway.  The international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons has noted that nations that support a ban comprise 21% of the world&rsquo;s population.  Why has there not been more progress on getting to a world free of such weapons?  This leads one to ask why countries want nuclear weapons.  Who would want an instrument that could blow the world to smithereens, including the country that possesses the weapon?</P>
        <P>We constantly talk about living in challenging times though we are usually referring to economics, climate change or population growth but the threat of annihilation through nuclear war remains serious.  One country claims that having a nuclear weapon is a deterrent from attack and seeks it as a safety net but that will not work because it incites other countries to acquire the same weapons, which means we will then find ourselves in the middle of an arms race.  If one country has a weapon, it acts as an incentive and throws down the gauntlet to those that do not.  The Middle East is fragile and volatile and, therefore, the last thing it needs is further escalation in nuclear weapons building.  There are concerns about Iran&rsquo;s uranium enrichment programme but a suggestion to use pre-emptive force against its facilities could be a trigger for a ferocious war.  Even calling for strengthened sanctions against Iran is not conducive to maintaining peace.  Diplomatic action, not military action, is needed.</P>
        <P>The threat of force is also counterproductive because one cannot beat fire with fire.  Another aspect of this, which is similar to the pot calling the kettle black or saying &ldquo;Do as I say but not as I do&rdquo; is the entire focus is on Iran while the nuclear weapon programmes of its neighbours are ignored, which is hypocritical.  It would be better for all to support the UN process to establish a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, made a speech on this issue two years ago during which he stated: &ldquo;The momentum is building towards a nuclear weapon free world&rdquo;.  That has gone off the boil but he mentioned another contradiction.  Countries that have increased their military spending have, at the same time, introduced cuts to social security, health and environmental protection.  Having a nuclear arms free world, far from adding to international peace and security, is putting them in jeopardy.  He called on governments to reveal the extent of their nuclear arsenals.</P>
        <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I attended a meeting on 1 March which was addressed by the former Canadian senator, Douglas Roche, the founding chairman of Middle Powers Initiative, a group of eight international NGOs.  Their mission statement is dedicated to worldwide reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons in a series of well defined stages accompanied by increasing verification and control.  He very much acknowledged Ireland&rsquo;s role in the non-proliferation treaty and its commitment to nuclear disarmament.  He sees the world moving to a new stage in efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons and he feels economic realities are making them unaffordable but that is not borne out by the $100 million being spent annually on these arms.  In the same breath, he said the UN Secretary General and President Obama have tried to lead the way to a nuclear weapons free world but the US contributes $50 billion annually to such weapons.  The issue of the use of drones by the US and Great Britain to fire indiscriminately at targets with the loss of civilian life in many cases must be tackled.  Mr. Roche thinks the major states were less than lukewarm about taking this on.  There is, therefore, a body of thought that looks on nuclear weapons as a deterrent to exerting power.  They might go along with some reduction but elimination is either not on the agenda or not just yet.  Mr. Roche mentioned the convoluted logic whereby countries see safety from nuclear weapons as depending on their deployment and feel deprived if they do not have these arsenals at their disposal.  He also made a reference, which has not been addressed, to the theft of nuclear material, particularly from former Soviet Union countries.</P>
        <P>We are aware of the damage and destruction nuclear weapons can do.  I support the calls to ensure State funds are not invested in companies involved in the nuclear weapons industry, including in Ireland.  We should continue to support the non-proliferation treaty and work towards the nuclear weapons convention.  Perhaps there is a reason now to reopen our embassy in Teheran in order that we can continue to work with Iran.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
        <P>I commend Deputy Murphy for proposing the debate, which is very much welcome, as this is an important subject on which we should make our voice heard.  I strongly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to uphold a proud tradition in this country of opposing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and playing an important international role in seeking to prevent the proliferation of such weapons and to bring about nuclear disarmament, hopefully to move us as quickly as possible to a world free of such weapons.</P>
        <P>I suspect the majority of people in the House and in the world believe nuclear weapons are an utter obscenity.  I find it difficult to comprehend the mindset that came up with such weapons or that states would wish to develop weapons with this obscene destructive power.  Following the horrors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima where hundreds of thousands of people were vaporised in an instant and the entire cities laid waste in a few seconds, the notion that any state could claim to be interested in democracy, peace, stability and progressive values while involved in promoting, developing or threatening the use of these weapons is appalling.  The madness of nuclear weapons is even more starkly highlighted in the current economic crisis faced by the world where vast numbers of people across the globe, including in Europe, are living in poverty and lack sufficient access to basic public services.  While states claim they do not have the money to provide them, in excess of $1 trillion a year is spent on weapons, a considerable amount of which is spent on maintaining nuclear arsenals and producing nuclear weapons and the various industries used to develop them.</P>
        <P>We must do everything we can to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons.  The Minister is correct that every effort must be made to ensure states that are considering the development of nuclear weapons, outside of those that have them, do not do so whether that is Iran, Syria or any other country.  I do not believe claims that countries are trying to prevent nuclear proliferation has great credibility when they fail to deal with the enormous issue of double standards on the part of the main nuclear states and the largest powers in the world, including the US, Russia, China, Britain and France.  The other states that have developed nuclear weapons such as North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel could not have done so without the assistance, co-operation and involvement of the major nuclear states.</P>
        <P>If we are serious in confronting this issue, we must address the hypocrisy and double standards in our attitudes to the major powers and their refusal to dismantle their own nuclear arsenals.  The T&aacute;naiste referred in his speech to the many specific requirements being imposed on Iran to comply with the non-proliferation treaty and the demands of the International Atomic Energy Authority, but there are no similar demands made of Israel.  I do not understand the double standards that operate in regard to that country.  It has 200 to 400 nuclear weapons but refuses to sign up to the NPT, which, incidentally, Iran has signed up to and is compliant with.  There is no credible evidence that the latter is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capacity, yet it is subjected to threats of military attack while nothing is done about Israel.  Last year the United States increased its annual military aid contribution to Israel from $3 billion to $4 billion and has, in recent years, made arrangements to take nuclear waste from the country.  We do not know where waste from the Dimona nuclear reactor is going, but many in Palestine suspect that at least some of it is being dumped under Gaza and Hebron, areas with large Palestinian populations.  The credibility of this State is seriously undermined by the involvement of companies based here in the production of components for the nuclear weapons industry and the arms industry generally.  We disgrace ourselves further by continuing to facilitate United States warplanes involved in brutal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Ireland&rsquo;s stance on this important issue.  Since the late 1950s, this country has been actively engaged in the diplomacy of nuclear non-proliferation.  Joining the United Nations gave Ireland the opportunity to express a more positive and assertive neutrality.  One of the high points of this strategy was the role played by the State in encouraging the General Assembly to take a position on the question of nuclear non-proliferation, or as it was referred to by the UN, &ldquo;non-dissemination of nuclear weapons&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>For a small state, Ireland has played a considerable role in securing agreement on a formula that clearly identified the problem and put in motion a strategy for dealing with it.  For his strenuous efforts in this regard, the exceptional work conducted by a former representative in this House of County Louth, the late Frank Aiken`, should be acknowledged.  He has the distinguished record of being the second longest sitting Deputy, with in excess of 50 years service in the Oireachtas.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s policy of promoting the primacy of international law and reducing global tensions at the height of the Cold War, Mr. Aiken promoted the idea of areas of law, which helped to free the most tense regions around the world from the threat of nuclear war.  In addition, he sponsored the resolution to prevent the so-called wider dissemination of nuclear weapons and proposed peace initiatives for the crisis in the Middle East.</P>
        <P>It was Mr. Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs, who put forward the notion of a non-proliferation treaty at the United Nations in 1958, and a further series of Irish-sponsored resolutions led to the signing of the NPT in 1968.  Ireland was the first country to sign and ratify the treaty, which entered into force in 1970.  The NPT is built around three key pillars, namely, non-proliferation, disarmament and the right to peaceful deployment of nuclear energy.  A five-yearly review conference, last held in 2010, monitors its ongoing implementation.  At a meeting in Dublin in June 1998, Ireland became one of the founding members of the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, which now comprises Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden.  The NAC has played an important role in bringing proposals to the five-yearly NPT review conference.  On 9 June 1998, an 18 point declaration, Towards a Nuclear Weapons-Free World: The Need for a New Agenda, was signed by the governments of the NAC countries.</P>
        <P>Current proliferation challenges facing the NPT include regional issues in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Iran and Syria, lack of universal adherence to the NPT by India, Israel and Pakistan, and the lack of full co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Authority and its safeguards and verification system by the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Iran and Syria.  In addition, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT, has yet to enter into force and a treaty banning fissile materials remains to be negotiated.  Ireland is a strong supporter of efforts to implement the Middle East resolution, agreed at the 1995 NPT review and extension conference.  Agreed as part of a package deal which also included the indefinite extension of the NPT, the resolution calls for the establishment of a weapons of mass destruction-free zone in the region.  In 2010, Ireland brokered agreement on a text reaffirming the resolution and setting out several practical next steps.</P>
        <P>Ireland has decided not to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as part of its energy mix and is of the view that those states which do must demonstrate the exclusively peaceful nature of their programmes.  My constituents are all too aware of the nuclear threat, with both Dundalk and Drogheda being closer to the Thorp nuclear plant in Sellafield than is, for example, London. The emergence of cancer clusters in Louth has been linked to the wind flows from the Sellafield plant.  On a global level, <i>The Irish Times</i> ran an article last week which suggested that Iran is designing a nuclear submarine<i>. </i> The nuclear threat is ever present and it is incumbent on us all to continue the good work initiated by my fellow Louth man, the late Mr. Aiken.  For the good of all mankind, we must fervently support the principle of nuclear disarmament.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  There is absolutely no moral or political excuse for any country to have nuclear weapons.  They are always utterly unjustifiable.  As such, it is an international disgrace that countries continue to spend billions of euro and dollars on these weapons while so many people throughout the world are cold and hungry.  That is the core of this debate.  Ireland has always taken a leading position on this issue on the international stage.  We should now take an even stronger position and provide further leadership by working in conjunction with countries that share our world vision.  There are elements in this society and in this Government that would, given half a chance, have us all in the nuclear club.  It is up to Deputies of all parties and none to stand firm on this issue.</P>
        <P>I support the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.  How can anybody who calls to mind what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki take a different view?  Some of our world leaders are living on another planet when it comes to this issue and must be challenged everywhere, including in the D&aacute;il, at the United Nations and at European Union level.  The Government must take the challenge to the international stage.  I support non-violent campaigns to rid the world of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction with a view to ensuring genuine security for future generations.  I oppose all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, their development, manufacture, testing, deployment and threatened use by any country.   I would like to see four simple things happen.  I would like to see the elimination of all nuclear weapons by our nearest neighbour, Britain, not to mention the global abolition of nuclear weapons; the abolition of other weapons of mass destruction with indiscriminate effect; a nuclear-free, a less militarised and more secure Europe, and a broader debate on the nuclear power industry, a debate from which we seem to run away.</P>
        <P>It is important Independent Deputies express their views, which are not always against everything.  I always bring forward constructive proposals.  I would like to change Government policies as a major contribution to bring about the global elimination of nuclear weapons.  I would like to see a wider public debate on the need for alternatives to the nuclear cycle and military attempts to resolve conflict.  I would like to empower the people to engage actively in the political process to work for a nuclear free and peaceful future.  I would like to co-operate with groups in Ireland, at UN and EU levels and internationally to ensure greater mutual security.  These are core and important issues in the debate.</P>
        <P>I mention the misinformation in recent weeks on the topical issue of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities.  The United States, its European allies and even Israel generally agree on three things about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme: Teheran does not have a bomb, it has not decided to build one and it is probably years from having a deliverable nuclear warhead.  From my point of view, Iran has no nuclear weapons.  I met the Iranian ambassador recently and received a commitment from him on that issue.  Iran has no nuclear weapons programme.  The supreme leader of Iran, whether we agree or disagree with him or like his politics, said that as far as he was concerned, the possession of weapons was a grave sin.  The November 2011 report of the IAEA did not claim Iran had a nuclear weapons programme.  Iran is not in breach of any obligation under the NPT.  Uranium enrichment is Iran&rsquo;s inalienable right under the NPT.  The United States and its allies are trying to deny Iran its right to uranium enrichment under the treaty.  These are the facts.  Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities are open to regular inspection but Israel&rsquo;s are not.  That seems to be the elephant in the room and the silence in Europe is deafening.</P>
        <P>A double standard is being applied in regard to the possession of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.  Iran which has none is the subject of ferocious economic sanctions and the threats of military action.  Sadly, the Government seems to be silent on this issue.  Israel which has as many as 400 weapons and the ability to deliver them to any capital in the Middle East is the beneficiary of more than $3 billion in military aid.  How many houses and schools could be provided and how many homeless people and Palestinians could be helped with this money?  That is the question we must raise.  The United States, Israel and others which are threatening military action against Iran are in breach of Article 2.4 of the UN charter which requires all UN member states to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.  This is something we should highlight.</P>
        <P>It is important that Ireland, as an independent and neutral state which is highly respected on the international stage, given its history and anti-colonial past, use its clout.  I know from talking to ambassadors from Argentina, Cuba and elsewhere that they have great respect for Ireland, but they also expect it to act as a peace broker.  That is something at which we should look.</P>
        <P>In recent days we witnessed the row about the Malvinas with Argentina.  We should say to Britain that it should go to the United Nations to try to resolve the issue.  We should not be namby-pamby, walk away and issue press releases.  I was very disappointed with Mr. David Cameron&rsquo;s stance in recent days on the Malvinas.  I know where I stand on the issue and others know too, given what I call the islands.</P>
        <P>Ireland has the potential to be a nuclear and peace broker on the international stage.  That is why we want a strong and decisive Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  We want leadership, commitment and determination, which reflects their views.  Iran does not have a nuclear weapons programme.</P>
        <P>I would like to bring forward some proposals on what Ireland can do because it is all very well to give out about things.  Ireland, despite its economic difficulties, should continue to pay a leading role in support of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  It should take the lead in working for a nuclear weapons convention, together with other like-minded states.  It should be used as a base for debates and conferences.  We should bring international peace activitists here and use our clout.  Ireland should continue to support the processes and frameworks of the non-proliferation treaty, but it must be prepared to move beyond the NPT to address the treaty&rsquo;s weaknesses which it should pick out and get on with it.  It should engage with NGOs such as the International Red Cross and the International Red Crescent and like-minded states to apply international humanitarian law to achieve a ban on nuclear weapons.  It should also support a multilateral approach to easing the nuclear tensions in the Middle East.  That is where we can come on the pitch and deliver.  Ireland should ban investments by State funds and financial institutions based here in companies involved in the nuclear arms industry.</P>
        <P>We have a glorious opportunity.  The T&aacute;naiste has said Ireland has pursued a policy of complete opposition to nuclear weapons and that this policy has enjoyed strong cross-party political support in this House, which is very important.  However, we need to up our game in this regard.  We need to say on the international stage that Ireland stands for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.  Ireland should look at the economic argument also.  What is the logic in spending billions of euro and dollars on building nuclear weapons, the vast majority of which, thankfully or I hope, will never be used when there are areas of the world which need massive investment and in which people are starving?  This issue must be linked in the debate.</P>
        <P>Article 29.1 of the Constitution states, &ldquo;Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality&rdquo;.  We should demand on the international stage an end to spending on, and the elimination of, nuclear weapons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</NameTxt>
        <P>When Oppenheimer saw the results of his first test of the atomic bomb he had helped to create, he said, &ldquo;I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.&rdquo;  He was quoting from a Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita.  It cuts directly to much of what we are speaking about and why we are discussing this important issue.</P>
        <P>Every year on 6 August a small group of people gather by a cherry blossom tree in Merrion Square.  The tree was planted in 1980 to commemorate the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.  It was planted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Ireland.  I recognise the good works of Mr. David Hutchinson Edgar and CND in Ireland and all they have done to date to keep this issue to the fore.  I was honoured to speak at this event a few years ago when I was a councillor and have attended it since as a Deputy.  It is not a very large group.  Generally, the same people attend year after year and they are usually a little older than me.  The Japanese ambassador attends as an invited guest.  The ambassadors from the nuclear weapons states are invited, although none has attended when I have.  Given the number who attend, their age profile and how quietly this event takes place, one would think we were commemorating an event that took place a long time ago.  No one would think that this was still a problem which confronted us and I should not be interested in this issue because the potential threat of the use of nuclear weapons and their existence should no longer be a problem in that people older, wiser and more experienced than me should have solved it by now such that it should no longer be on the agenda and considered as important an issue.  No one is really taking an active interest, apart from the diehards who are very good and committed.  It is dangerous, however, that this issue is not to the fore in our debates and discussions, as it ought be, because, as the threat recedes from our memories and the collective subconscious, it becomes more real.</P>
        <P>My interest is accidental.  I began by studying conflict resolution and ended up studying weapons proliferation, a subject which fascinated me.  I was fascinated because I saw how nuclear weapons had shaped international history and continued to shape international relations.  I was also fascinated by the important role Ireland had always played in this sphere.  I knew nothing about this until I studied it.  I retained an interest in the subject and, after leaving university, worked in the area for four years, before coming a politician.  At the conference on disarmament in Geneva I was fortunate enough to have time to work with the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna.  I was always very interested in how visionary, bold and ambitious Ireland was.  During the formation and implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, the cornerstone of our non-proliferation and disarmament efforts and regime, Ireland was the world leader and a visionary.  The treaty began with Ireland, that is, with Mr. Frank Aiken in the 1950s.  He had a very real and prescient concern that one day the weapons would disseminate to terrorists.  This trend continued in the 1990s when, as visionaries and leaders, we formed the New Agenda Coalition.  In the conference to review the NPT in 2000 we agreed on 13 practical steps towards nuclear weapons disarmament.  We cannot say we have been and continue to be world leaders and visionaries on very many major international issues.</P>
        <P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Whips for agreeing to this debate and allowing time to discuss the matter.  I had sought a discussion on it through the Whip who recognised immediately its importance.  That is why we are discussing it today.  It is important because some of the key tensions in the world concern the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation or the continued existence of nuclear weapons and the failure to achieve the nuclear disarmament objectives that we all sought to achieve when we opened the NPT for signature in the 1960s.  We must bear in mind the Cold War tensions that are resurfacing in Europe over proposed missile shields and new missiles, tensions in the Middle East and the growing isolation of Iran, the rush to war in Iraq and its aftermath, and the North Korean regime&rsquo;s breaking of almost all of the remaining taboos on nuclear weapons, including that on testing, as it attempts to ape some of its neighbours and perceived rivals.  We must note the dangers posed by the possession of nuclear weapons by unstable governments.  We are not sure how the coming to power of a new government could lead to increased tensions.  We envisage possible arms racing on the subcontinent.  That is just the present set of circumstances, which is wholly separate from the considerable damage nuclear weapons and their existence have caused for human life since they were first invented.  In this regard, we must bear in mind the people living on the Polynesian islands who were displaced and affected by testing in the 1950s and later; the victims the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings; the victims on the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>; and the victims dying of hunger in North Korea today because that country&rsquo;s regime has decided to spend so much money in trying to create a weapon it could almost certainly never use.</P>
        <P>As many Deputies have outlined, Ireland has had a good reputation historically.  It is only right that the D&aacute;il consider these matters in order that our strong record and independent voice can continue.  It is only right also that we all be given an opportunity to contribute to this most important of debates in which I welcome all contributions.  We must recognise that, as parliamentarians, we have a different role from that of the Government.  This is true in all modern democracies, which is why we have the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a union between countries for parliamentarians and elected officials to promote issues separate from those of their governments.  The PNND, which was mentioned, promotes this objective.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I was heartened to hear the T&aacute;naiste respond so positively recently to the international joint parliamentary statement on a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.  I recognise all the good work our diplomats are doing and have done in this sphere, particularly for the NPT review conference in 2010 and our work in seeking to secure a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East.  In this regard, our work is incredibly important.  Our efforts in the D&aacute;il and those of the Government are very much aligned.  We now begin the process of preparing for the NPT review conference in 2015.  The first preparatory committee meeting was held recently, at the end of April.  So much needs to be done.  Members&rsquo; contributions and the points they regarded as important indicate that a huge range of issues needs to be addressed.  However, if we are to expect the non-proliferation pillar of the NPT to remain standing and robust, we must work on the key pillar of disarmament.  We still have the capacity to destroy all human life on this planet many times over.  If we do not continue in our pursuit of disarmament and achieve greater reductions in nuclear arsenals, that threat will not change.  We face the risk of new countries entering the nuclear club and existing members advancing their arsenals rather than reducing them.  We must, therefore, bring disarmament centre-stage if we are to have a chance of making progress with countries such as Iran and North Korea and if we are ever to hope those outside the treaty who possess nuclear weapons will sign up to the disarmament principles therein.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as part of the New Agenda Coalition, helped to negotiate the 13 practical steps in 2000.  The very first of these steps was seeking a commitment to bring into force the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, CTBT.  By banning the testing of nuclear weapons, possible new entrants will be kept from becoming nuclear powers and existing members cannot introduce new weapons into their arsenals.  A ban on testing means no new nuclear weapons and no new nuclear weapon states.  If we are to get rid of these weapons, that is where we must start.  We have started on this path and started well.  The CTBT has been signed by 183 countries.  Its verification system of 337 stations around the globe, ensuring compliance with its provisions, is in place.  It has its headquarters in Vienna, where I worked and the executive secretary, Mr. Tibor T&oacute;th, and his team are tirelessly working in pursuit of the treaty&rsquo;s goals.  Good people are working hard for the betterment of us all and the Government is working with them.  It is important to recognise this.  Apart from North Korea, no country has tested or exploded a nuclear device in 14 years.  The norm against nuclear weapons testing is established and robust.  Regrettably, however, the treaty is not yet in force.  Bearing in mind the complicated ratification procedures, eight states must yet ratify the treaty for it to become international law.  These are China, Egypt, North Korea, India, Iran, Israel, Pakistan and the United States.  Entry into force of the CTBT is the next logical, practical and possible step in the nuclear disarmament race.</P>
        <P>Let us be visionaries again.  Let us have a singular goal as we work towards the review conference in 2015.  In the same way as 1995 is remembered for the indefinite extension of the treaty, as 2000 is for the 13 practical steps, let 2015 be remembered for the achieving of the entry into force of the CTBT.  Let Ireland be remembered with it, which might sound ambitious to some.  To others, however, it will not be ambitious enough.  We can do it; let us, at least, try.  All we can do is try, and if we fail,  no matter, we can try again &mdash;  fail again, fail better.  It behoves us, given our history in this area and our great responsibility on the world stage in the efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament, to work towards our singular goal.</P>
        <P>Tomorrow will see the official opening of Ireland&rsquo;s national data centre in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, as referred to by the T&aacute;naiste.  National data centres around the world form part of the global alarm system that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization has been building.  Opening the national data centre reaffirms our commitment to being part of this very important verification regime, which is very welcome.  We are and always have been part of the system.  It is now time to start shaping it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am sharing time with Deputy Anne Ferris.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  Ireland is viewed internationally as a distinguished and credible advocate for nuclear disarmament and supporter of non-proliferation.  During the Cold War it was a progressive voice in the international sphere for disarmament.  While superpowers were stockpiling vast nuclear arsenals and other states retained nuclear weapons programmes or continued to develop secret ones, Ireland worked in the multilateral forum of the United Nations to rid the world of this scourge.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently punched above its weight on the nuclear issue.  From the time of Mr. Frank Aiken&rsquo;s Irish resolutions in the 1950s and 1960s to the formation of the New Agenda Coalition in 1998 and the skilled diplomacy of the Irish delegation that led to the reaffirmation of the Middle East resolution at the 2010 NPT review conference, Ireland has played a positive role.  This is one area in which Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation remains strong and credible.  However, our reputation is not something we can rest on; we need to maintain it year in, year out and build on it.  Ireland needs to remain a strong voice for international nuclear disarmament and a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation.</P>
        <P>This means not only must we criticise rogue states for pursuing nuclear weapons programmes, but also we should ask difficult questions of our allies who are dragging their heels on nuclear disarmament.</P>
        <P>We must also remain a strong advocate for rigorous inspection programmes.  If a state has a peaceful nuclear programme, then that state needs to allow full-scale International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, and there should be no exceptions.  Approximately 30 countries have developed nuclear power for energy purposes and this, too, has its dangers, as we witnessed in Japan last year with the meltdown at the Fukushima plant.</P>
        <P>Unlike many of our European neighbours, Ireland does not pursue nuclear energy, as would be our right under the terms of the NPT.  Our energy mix remains nuclear free and I strongly hope it remains so.  Some commentators have used the current economic challenges this country faces to advocate a move towards nuclear energy.  I am glad this is gaining little or no traction with the public.  Ireland must remain nuclear free.  The programme for Government calls on us to develop our own domestic renewable energy potential through exploiting our wind and geothermal resources.  This is where this country&rsquo;s future lies for energy.</P>
        <P>Even the best regulated nuclear energy facilities can produce environmental disasters, as was evident in the meltdown of the Fukushima plant.  Prior to this disaster Japan was seen as the gold standard for nuclear regulation.  Nuclear energy is not worth the risk.  The environmental, ecological, and human risks are too great.</P>
        <P>Ireland is on the right sight of the nuclear divide: no to weapons, no to developing weapons and no to nuclear energy.  We need to continue to spread this message beyond our own shores.  The very existence of nuclear weapons brings a perpetual insecurity to our fragile planet.  We need to move towards a world without nuclear weapons and Ireland must continue to lead the way.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to examine the merits of a nuclear weapons convention, not as a replacement of the NPT but as a logical conclusion to the NPT&rsquo;s aims.  The world requires a binding legal covenant which would provide for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.  I am under no illusion this can be achieved in the short or even medium term, but the global elimination of nuclear weapons needs to be central to our disarmament policy.</P>
        <P>I will conclude with the words of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, who, in 2010 as a Labour Party Deputy, stated: &ldquo;The aspiration for a nuclear weapons-free world contained in the NPT needs to be translated into reality with the emergence of a Nuclear Weapons Convention, saving the world from nuclear annihilation.&rdquo;  This is the direction in which the world needs to move, and Ireland needs to provide the leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnneFerris"><NameTxt>Deputy Anne Ferris</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter here today.  The issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is one on which Ireland can proudly say it has taken the lead in past times.  As my colleague, Deputy Ryan, stated, the late Minister, Frank Aiken, in 1958, took the lead on this matter when he proposed a series of resolutions in the UN General Assembly.  From these, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, NPT, was developed.</P>
        <P>Since its enactment in 1970, the NPT has become widely adopted by most countries around the world.  Its three key pillars have been very beneficial in controlling the development of nuclear weapons and these are based around disarmament, non-proliferation and the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  Indeed, the initial success of the treaty is that the original five recognised nuclear states, the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France, have ratified it and this has led to reductions.</P>
        <P>Concerns have arisen, however, because of the acquisition of nuclear arms by India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea, countries that have not ratified this treaty or, in the case of the latter, withdrawn from it.  Indeed, Iran, which is a signatory to the NPT and has ratified it, has caused great controversy because of its nuclear developments.</P>
        <P>The State regards nuclear disarmament as a priority and has been vocal on the matter since those early resolutions in 1958.  In 1998, the New Agenda Coalition was founded in Dublin and a diverse group of countries came together for an 18 point declaration, entitled Towards a Nuclear Weapons-Free World: The Need for a New Agenda.  Since then, it has been active in promoting the necessary steps towards full nuclear disarmament.</P>
        <P>The weakness of the NPT is its lack of binding targets, and there are calls for a nuclear weapons convention.  I am supportive of these calls.  They seek to ban the manufacture, stockpiling or use of nuclear weapons and would provide specific timeframes for disarmament.  It is worth noting that this idea is supported by 146 countries and has the backing of the United Nations General Secretary, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.</P>
        <P>I was quite surprised by information sent to me this week by the Irish CND which stated that AIB, in majority State ownership, lent $28 million to an American company involved in the nuclear weapons industry in 2010.  This is disappointing.  Countries such as Norway and New Zealand prohibit this type of investment, and Ireland should consider doing the same.</P>
        <P>Though the NPT allows for stocks of uranium and plutonium to be used for peaceful purposes, I have deep reservations about the use of nuclear fuel for this purpose.  The experience of having a near neighbour in the UK that has the Sellafield plant is not a pleasant one.  For years I have been campaigning for the closure of this facility and I helped set up some years ago in County Wicklow the campaign to close Sellafield.</P>
        <P>The history of this plant has highlighted repeatedly the dangers of its operations.  There have been multiple instances where surrounding communities in the UK and in this country have been put in danger.  Over the decades since its establishment there have been more than 20 incidents involving radiological release.  The latest one, the Thorp plant leak in 2005, involved the leaking of more than 83,000 litres of radioactive material that evaded detection for in excess of nine months.  What is more, over this long period of time, Sellafield has continuously discharged low level radioactive waste into the sea.  Even though some of the radioactivity has been removed, the precipitate has still polluted the Irish Sea.  The UK Government is taking steps to shut down this part of the plant, although, unfortunately, this will take at least six years and they will also be building a new plant in its place.  Given the lack of competence in running the one at Sellafield, the idea of a new facility being built does not exactly fill me with confidence.</P>
        <P>Disregarding my concerns on this particular matter, the NPT has been useful in past times, though it needs to be strengthened, with binding targets set.  The idea of states being allowed to continue to develop weapons is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest and all efforts must be made to prevent it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
        <P>I am pleased to have a brief opportunity to participate in this debate.  It has been a useful discussion, with clear interest and engagement from Members, and I very much welcome that.  It is clear that the House&rsquo;s commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons is as strong as ever and I assure the House that the Government&rsquo;s commitment is equally strong.</P>
        <P>I thank all Members for their helpful contributions, on which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government will reflect.  No doubt we will have an opportunity to come back here to debate some of these issues in more detail, both here in plenary session and also at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
        <P>This is a policy area in which, it has been said, Ireland has always punched above its weight, and I think that is true.  It is something which we should rightly be proud of, but not complacent about.  Clearly, much is still required to be done and we are as determined as ever to ensure it is done.</P>
        <P>During the 2015 NPT review cycle, which commenced recently with the first, largely procedural, preparatory committee meeting in Vienna, NPT state parties will take stock of how the 64 follow-on actions agreed at the 2010 review conference are being implemented.  Over the next three years we will also decide where we would like the NPT to be in 2015 and we will work out how to get there.  It is important we capitalise on the positive outcome of the 2010 review conference and build on that further in 2015.</P>
        <P>Ireland will be among those countries seeking an ambitious outcome to the 2015 review conference, and as I have stated, we will be looking to the nuclear weapons states to build confidence in their stated commitment to disarm.  Progress on disarmament will undoubtedly assist further progress on non-proliferation.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that even in the context of our present difficult financial position, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation will remain a foreign policy priority for the Government.  This is an area in which Ireland has historically made, and still can make, a difference.  We can continue to do so at relatively little financial cost.  Our disarmament team, at home and abroad, is by universal standards very small.  We focus on those areas which we regard as a priority and where we can make a difference.  We pursue them doggedly and with considerable determination, conviction and passion, and this will continue.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset, strong political support for our policy in this area is important if Ministers and officials are to take forward positions on these issues in the relevant international fora.  My Department is grateful to the House for the strong support, not only as expressed in this debate but over many years and, indeed, decades.  We certainly do not take it for granted.</P>

        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to raise this important issue, namely, the need for the Health Service Executive to tackle the backlog in processing pension entitlements for 1,888 low paid, part-time former health board workers whose pension entitlements are integrated with social welfare payments.  The change in the way in which the service and remuneration of these workers is to be reckoned for pension calculation purposes was announced in Circular 20/2005 entitled, Public Service Pension Reform: Revised Arrangements for Part-time Public Servants, which was issued seven years ago.  Having pursued this matter since 2005, I am extremely frustrated that little progress has been made and it was for this reason that I felt compelled to take the matter to the floor of the House and seek commitments directly from the Minister.  Unfortunately, he is not present but I await his response on the matter.</P>
        <P>The change announced in the circular would result in a difference in pension benefit and contribution level for low paid, part-time HSE workers.  This would come in the form of integration of benefits from full to <i>pro rata </i>integrations for the pensions of part-time public servants.  The resultant changes would result in an increase in a weekly pension of between &euro;5 and &euro;70, depending on individual circumstances.  I am sure the Minister will agree that given the current economic hardships facing pensioners, any increase would make a massive difference to their quality of life.  Unfortunately, the retrospective element of this circular has not been fully implemented and backlogs remain in many of the former health board regions.</P>
        <P>The former Eastern Health Board region, including Dublin, Western Health Board region and Midland Health Board region have yet to clear their backlogs, with the result that 1,888 pensioners are awaiting changes to increase their pensions.  I understand from previous responses to parliamentary questions I have submitted on this matter that processing these changes is a substantial piece of work and resources within the Department are stretched.  However, changes for low paid pensioners appear to be constantly placed bottom of the HSE&rsquo;s priority list.  This should not be the case as it is grossly unfair.</P>
        <P>Low income pensioners are among the most vulnerable in society at this time.  Older people must be a priority and I ask that, if necessary, extra resources be made available to clear the backlogs associated with the circular.  Having waited for seven years, it is time something was done.  Will the Minister provide a guarantee that priority will be given to clearing the backlogs as soon as possible and ensuring low income pensioners receive their entitlements at the earliest possible time?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Brendan Ryan for raising this important issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I appreciate that the retirees concerned have been waiting for a considerable period for clarity on their full pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>In July 2005, the Department of Finance issued a circular to public service employers notifying them of a change in the method of calculating pensions of former employees whose pension entitlements are integrated with social welfare benefits.  This had the result of generally improving the pension paid to lower paid workers.  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that all eligible staff who retired since the circular came into effect have had their pensions calculated in accordance with the arrangements introduced in 2005.  However, as the Deputy stated, the cases of a cohort of staff who had retired before the changes were introduced had to be reviewed to establish whether their pension entitlements needed to be revised.  The HSE has been working to address this issue.</P>
        <P>It is important to appreciate that, as with other areas of public administration, the health service pensions function has experienced a loss of staff in recent years as a result of retirements and the requirement to reduce the size and cost of the public service.  Pensions administration is a complex area of work, requiring a considerable level of staff expertise and experience.  For this reason, it can be difficult to supplement existing capacity in the short-term.  Moreover, the workload in this area nationally has been much increased as a result, in particular, of the health service voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes in 2010 and 2011, as well as approximately 4,700 retirements during the latter stages of the pensions grace period which expired in February 2012.</P>
        <P>A concerted effort is being made to address the backlog in respect of staff who retired before the revised integration arrangements came into effect.  This work is being undertaken at regional rather than central level and involves the systematic review of manual records.  I understand the necessary recalculation has been fully implemented in the areas which previously constituted the north eastern, south eastern, southern and mid-western health boards.  The pensions of more than 400 pensioners in the north west have been reviewed and the review in this area will shortly be complete.  Arising from this work, approximately 300 pensioners will have increased pensions paid in July 2012.  This will come as good news to the individuals affected.</P>
        <P>Work has commenced in the west and east &mdash; two areas specifically referred to by Deputy Ryan &mdash; with a view to completing this task by the fourth quarter of the year.  Particular resource issues have arisen in respect of pensions processing capacity in the midlands and the HSE is working to put in place additional supports to address the backlog in this area.  I understand the concerns expressed by Deputy Ryan with regard to areas where the matter remains unresolved.  The Minister assures the House that the HSE is making all possible efforts to bring this long-standing issue to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
        <P>While I understand the constraints facing the HSE superannuation section and the loss of staff to the organisation in recent times, this issue first arose in 2005.  We could accept the HSE&rsquo;s excuse if the issue had arisen only recently but it has been ongoing for such a long time that no excuse is acceptable.  I ask that extra resources be made available to the relevant unit in order that it can process the backlogs as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>This issue is being addressed on a regional basis and certain regions, including the former North Eastern Health Board, South Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board and Mid-Western Health Board areas, have cleared their backlogs.  This demonstrates that some regions have given it the priority it deserves and completed the work required within a seven year timeframe.  It is not unreasonable to ask that the remaining regions bring some urgency to processing their backlogs in light of the time that has passed since the circular was released.</P>
        <P>In the final analysis we are dealing with pensioners who worked in low paid jobs and do not have Rolls Royce pension pots to live on.  With the economic challenges biting all in our society, pensioners are especially vulnerable.  Any increase in a pensioner&rsquo;s income would go a long way.  It might mean an extra bit of food in the fridge, or coal for the fire.  I ask the Minister to make a priority of clearing these backlogs and ensure these pensioners receive what they are entitled to and that this is done urgently.</P>
        <P>The other important point to make is that many of the people who are entitled to this have since died.  That is shocking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>I will certainly convey all the points made to the Minister.  The Deputy raised the possibility of getting extra staff to replace the outgoing staff.  I understand that this work is quite technical and that it takes a while to develop the necessary expertise, so it is not just a matter of transferring people across to do the work.  They have to be trained appropriately.  The HSE East and the HSE West are aiming to have the backlog cleared by the end of the autumn.  The midlands is probably the biggest problem area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
        <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this issue, following the publication of the report of the child death review panel yesterday.  The report made for harrowing reading, showing that 196 children in the care of the State or known to the State and the HSE since 2000 died, 112 of whom died from unnatural causes.  At the outset I commend the work of the report&rsquo;s authors, Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons, for the immense amount of time and effort they put into completing such a thorough report.  They got to the nub of each story about these children, many of whom met a very unfortunate and untimely end.  I would also like to acknowledge my former colleague and Minister of State, Barry Andrews, for initiating the report, as well as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for publishing the report yesterday without redaction.</P>
        <P>There are very important lessons we must learn from this report.  We must reform our child protection system so every possible step is taken by the State to ensure that those vulnerable children receive the services they require.  Reform is required to deliver that, but the resources must also be delivered so that the capacity exists in our child protection system to meet the needs as they arise.  To that end, I ask that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs look at reinstating the exemption to the public service recruitment embargo that had applied to social workers in the area of child and family services.  Over the course of the last year, we have gone from a system whereby all those positions were being backfilled to a system where it is being left to the discretion of the HSE.  In that time, we have gone from a situation where 93.9% of children in the care of the State had an assigned social worker to a situation in March 2012 where that dropped to under 92%.</P>
        <P>The Government must move to introduce mandatory aftercare.  In the report, we read that 27 of the 32 children in aftercare died by unnatural causes.  That shows the danger and difficulty that many of those children experience once they leave the care of the State.  It also shows how the State is failing those children by not ensuring that the aftercare is provided to them.</P>
        <P>There is a recommendation in the report to remove the <i>in camera</i> restrictions, whereby reporting cases involving child protection is not allowed.  We must ensure the recommendation is fully implemented.  It is only by shining a light on our child protection system that we can ensure the type of cases highlighted in this report do not happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here this afternoon but she did attend the committee this morning.</P>
        <P>Yesterday saw the publication by the Minister of the report of the independent child death review group.  The report, prepared by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons, gives details of the 196 children who died between 2000 and 2010, both of natural and unnatural causes.  The children in the report include children who were in the care of the State at the time of their death, young adults who were in aftercare and other children who were not in care but were known to the HSE.  The report contains details of the 112 children who died of unnatural causes.  Of these children, 17 were in care, 27 were in receipt of aftercare and 68 were not in care but were in some way known to the HSE child and family services.</P>
        <P>In the first instance I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the families of all the children and young adults who are the subject of this report.  The report highlights system failings in the Irish child protection services, including poor risk assessment, poor co-ordination between services, poor flows of information, limited access to specialist assessment and therapeutic services, as well as limited inter-agency work for children and families with complex needs.  The report further highlights a lack of early intervention and family support services responding proportionately to the needs of children at risk and families in crisis.  I have no doubt that if the system had done a better job, outcomes for some of these children might well have been very different.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that the report also comments on evidence of good practice, the wide range of services made available and the efforts made to intervene and build relationships to address the underlying vulnerabilities of the children by the HSE.  There are sufficient examples of excellent, compassionate practice for us to determine realistically that what is required is a system which supports and expects such good practice as standard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has welcomed the findings and recommendations of this report and accepts fully the need for action in the areas identified.  At this morning&rsquo;s joint committee meeting, the Minister confirmed that she will be putting in place an implementation programme with regular reports to the Government.  However, before publication of the report, action was already underway in a number of areas identified in it.  The Minister will be making an announcement in September on the further development of an independent child death review structure, following consultation with some of the key bodies and experts involved.  Next month will see the publication of the new HIQA national standards for the protection and welfare of children which will set out a new standards-based approach to the delivery of an effective and accountable child protection service.  Later this year, the Government will bring forward a proposed constitutional amendment to strengthen child protection further and give constitutional recognition to the best interests of the child.</P>
        <P>A key element of the ongoing reform programme is the removal of child welfare and protection services from the HSE and the establishment of a new child and family support agency.  The task force, established by the Minister to advise on the new agency, will present its final report by the end of this month and the agency, led by CEO designate Gordon Jeyes, will be established and up and running in January 2013.  The Minister will work with the new agency and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the provision of a seamless interface between child protection services and child and adolescent mental health services.  The Minister is also working with the Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, and the HSE on developing a fresh approach to identifying and addressing the hidden harm posed by substance misuse.  This is an area highlighted in a number of cases contained in the report.</P>
        <P>The provision of nationwide 24-hour social work assistance is being worked on in the context of the establishment of the new agency.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is consulting the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Courts Service on the preparation of new regulations regarding the <i>in camera</i> rule &mdash; to which the Deputy referred &mdash; to allow access to child welfare and protection hearings.  Yesterday, the Minister also announced the preparation of legislation to provide clarity around the issue of after-care provision to build on an improving picture of service provision in this area in recent years.</P>
        <P>The report of the independent review group makes for stark and uncomfortable reading.  I hope it is clear that this Government is committed to transparency and honesty regarding the challenges in getting children&rsquo;s services right.  Child protection remains a high priority on our agenda and changes at every level, including those relating to policy, law, structures and individual practitioners, will continue to be made and these will make a difference for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  The challenge of reforming our child protection system and making it fit for purpose does not begin or end with the publication of the report.  The challenge to ensure proper and appropriate services are delivered to vulnerable children must continue to be met daily.  The report published yesterday relates to the period 2000 to March 2010.  Since the latter date and May of this year, some 46 further children who were in the care of the State or who were known to the HSE have died.  That number reflects those contained in the report.  This illustrates the ongoing need for the HSE to ensure those children who are most vulnerable obtain the resources they require.</P>
        <P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s announcement this morning that a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights will be held before the end of the year.  This referendum will ensure the voice of children will be key and that children themselves will be central to everything we do.  I also welcome the proposals for reform.  It is vital the establishment of an agency separate from the HSE leads to real and meaningful reform and to the integration of services in the area of child welfare.  It is also important the Government should put the necessary resources into the system.  This issue was highlighted by both authors of the report published yesterday who stated the system does not have the required resources and is overstretched.  I accept reform is required but there is also a need to provide resources.</P>
        <P>I ask the Department and the Government to reinstate the full exemption relating to the recruitment embargo that was in place.  In addition, they should consider increasing the numbers of social workers and those employed in the area of mental health services in order that we might ensure services are delivered to children as they need them.  In recent months, the number of children in care with assigned social workers has been in decline.  We must put a stop to this and ensure that, as a basic right, every child in the care of the State has a social worker assigned to him or her.  Those social workers will be able to look after those children&rsquo;s cases and ensure they obtain access to co-ordinated services and receive protection from the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge this matter is non-partisan in terms of party politics.  I acknowledge the support of Deputy McConalogue and others in respect of it.  Our focus must be on children and their needs.  I agree with the Deputy that a consistent focus is required in order that we might continue to address the various areas highlighted in the report.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment in respect of the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights has been clearly outlined.  The referendum will certainly be an important element in all of this.  There is a great deal of work to be done in respect of these very young and vulnerable children.</P>
        <P>I will convey to the Minister the points the Deputy has made.  I am sure the Houses of the Oireachtas will maintain a very strong focus on this matter in the coming years to ensure we make better provision for these vulnerable children in the future.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present to take this matter.  I am sure she is familiar with the background to the Dominick Street regeneration project.  It is one of the flagship regeneration projects that has been promoted by Dublin City Council in recent years.  It was recently dealt a hammer blow when the construction company that was in place declared itself no longer to be in a position to deliver the project.  This has plunged the project into grave difficulty.</P>
        <P>The Dominick Street regeneration project is located at the top of O&rsquo;Connell Street in the city centre.  The community there is a long-standing, vibrant and very proud one and its members have been making do in very difficult circumstances.  The one ray of light for them in recent times was the fact the project finally received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Dominick Street regeneration project had been plagued by two huge difficulties, namely, the lack of a lead developer and also the lack of planning permission.  As a result of the fact that planning permission had never been granted, it was extremely difficult to attract a lead developer.  Those who were interested in becoming involved with the project were never quite sure what they were going to be in a position to build.</P>
        <P>I tabled this matter to urge the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to take the most active role possible in either facilitating or funding the facilitation of this project.  The community in the Dominick Street area has put up with a huge number of difficulties and has done really well in such circumstances.  Its members now finally have an idea with regard to how their physical environment might look in a few years time.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure everything is done to give them the support they so badly need and really deserve.  I anticipate what I hope will be a positive reply from her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank Deputy Donohoe for raising this issue.  As he is aware, regeneration is a matter in which I have a particular interest.  I wish to begin by restating my commitment and that of my Department and the Government to the national regeneration programme.  My Department supports an ambitious range of regeneration projects which seek to address the causes of disadvantage in communities and large social housing estates through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  Of the &euro;390 million available to me under the 2012 housing programme, I have set aside some &euro;90 million &mdash; 23% of the total &mdash; to progress regeneration projects in 2012, including that at Dominick Street.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Dublin City Council previously intended carrying out the redevelopment of Dominick Street by way of a public private partnership.  Under these arrangements, it was intended to deliver a significant mixed-use development at no net cost to the Exchequer.  However, by late 2008 the downturn in the housing market and wider economic conditions had made the original plans for the public private partnership project unviable.  With support from my Department, the council established a multidisciplinary special housing task force to examine alternative redevelopment options.  As a result of this process, the council developed a proposal for a mixed-use development at Dominick Street to include 58 housing units, seven commercial units, a new community centre with a multi-purpose hall and related facilities, a covered sports pitch and 3,525 sq. m of public realm improvement works locally.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the proposed development on 22 May last.</P>
        <P>The next step in this process will be the preparation of a detailed proposal by Dublin City Council for submission to my Department.  I expect this submission will build on the good work done by the council in consultation with the local community and regeneration boards and will address the social, economic and physical regeneration needs of the community in the area.  I have allocated over &euro;40 million to regeneration projects in Dublin this year, some &euro;15 million of which is earmarked for regeneration projects including Dominick Street, Croke Villas, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Saint Theresa&rsquo;s Gardens, Saint Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dolphin House.  Dublin City Council continues to operate a de-tenanting strategy, with the support of the Department, for the relocation of households out of the regeneration areas to facilitate the demolition of vacant buildings.  Of the funding available to Dublin City Council in 2012 approximately &euro;7 million has been assigned for this purpose.  I anticipate that demolition works on some of the flat blocks in the Dominick Street complex will commence later this year.</P>
        <P>Now that the statutory planning element has been dealt with, it is a matter for the city council to prepare the detailed regeneration plan for the Dominick Street complex and to set out how this will be delivered over the next few years.  Given its strategic location, I expect that there will be considerable private sector interest in the commercial element of the project.  There is potential to involve approved housing bodies in the residential and community elements and also, in the interests of furthering the sustainable communities agenda, to make some housing units available for private purchase or for purchase under the incremental purchase scheme.  In the meantime, my Department will liaise closely with the city council in finalising the detailed plans and will continue to provide funding for ongoing regeneration work locally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  When the regeneration plan comes from the city council, following the successful granting of planning permission, I hope the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will do all it can to respond positively to the regeneration plan.  The Minister of State has highlighted the likelihood of commercial interest in the site.  It is in an amazing location in the city centre.  Given the amount of money the Government has already earmarked for regeneration in the capital, there is potential for the Department to make an amount of money available upon which the city council can build, using its own resources and the funds it will attract from the private sector.</P>
        <P>The collapse of this regeneration project was one of the heralds of the end of the period of extraordinary growth through which the economy went.  I hope the future funding of the project will herald the return of a better kind of growth.  I ask the Minister of State to keep this in mind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>

Again, I emphasise my commitment and that of the Department to regeneration and to continued funding of it.  Co-operation with the city council will be an important part of that.</P>
        <P>I cannot anticipate the submission of Dublin City Council but I assure the Deputy that I will fully co-operate and respond to the submissions that come to the Department.</P>

        <P>Serious issues were raised by the stand-off in Clonmoylan last night which the Minister needs to address.  Fully assembled State forces amassed against ordinary decent citizens.  This represents a major new departure in State policy and sets a dangerous precedent.  We cannot ignore the fact that this took place against a backdrop of the closure of many rural Garda stations, of women in some areas being told their safety cannot be guaranteed at night because of lack of Garda resources, and so on.  In this climate, there assembled last night between 40 and 50 garda&iacute;, more than 20 vehicles belonging to the Garda and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Garda emergency response unit.  Dozens of the unit&rsquo;s members assembled on a rural country lane, to deal with what threat to the State?</P>
        <P>The incident that provoked this response from the State was an attempt by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to confiscate the private property, a hopper and excavator, of Mr. Michael Darcy.  Garda&iacute; attempted to load the property onto a low loader and were met by a peaceful protest by residents of the area.</P>
        <P>How did this situation develop as it did?  We are talking about private property on privately owned land.  It was alleged that the equipment had been used to cut turf on a special area of conservation, SAC.  On what basis was the decision to confiscate the machinery made?  I would like the Minister to deal with the fact that the property, which cost approximately &euro;70,000, was later burnt out.  Who will compensate the owner for that?  The owner is in hospital and will remain there for some time.  Residents came from as far afield as Castlebar, Kerry, Sligo and Laois to offer solidarity with the peaceful protest.</P>
        <P>The incident took place against a backdrop of the House, including the Minister, accepting a Private Members&rsquo; motion recommending a process that would resolve the issues raised by the turf-cutters and achieve the goal, which we all share, of protecting raised bogs.  Why is the Government not pursuing that resolution?  Why is it not being worked on?  How much effort is being put into securing it?  It would cost the State far less money to do that than to assemble the forces that were deployed last night against ordinary citizens.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to deal with the fact that the report, which the House endorsed, would have allowed a greater proportion of raised bog to be protected but would also have given turf-cutters the right to access their traditional turf cutting.  Why is that not being pursued?  It is the solution to the crisis.</P>
        <P>Why was the armed response unit deployed in this way?  It was an attempt to intimidate citizens and to force them to yield to State power.  It will not work.  It is an incredibly dangerous tactic.  Weaponry was assembled against citizens on country laneways last night.  Anything could have gone wrong.  I am sure most people believe the armed response unit should be used only to deal with a national emergency, such as a kidnapping.  It certainly should not be used against ordinary people.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to deal with these points.  How does he think the situation will end?  The only resolution, from the point of view of justice and economic and environmental sustainability, is to deal with the issue on the basis of dialogue and discussion and to accept the compromise put forward by the turf-cutters and contractors and endorsed by the House a few months ago.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity to affirm the reasons for the Garda involvement in relation to the matters in question.</P>
        <P>It speaks volumes that the Deputy has raised the matter by referring to &ldquo;the use of State forces in Clonmoylan Bog&rdquo;.  By referring to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this manner she shows an extraordinary lack of respect for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the work it does.  This is no more than an emotive attempt to denigrate public servants who are simply doing their job.  Let me say with absolute clarity that I support fully the efforts of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with a difficult situation not of their making, but encouraged by Deputy Luke &ldquo;Ming&rdquo; Flanagan and other Deputies, who seem to believe there is an <i>&agrave;la carte</i>  menu of laws, some of which they can choose to comply with and others which they and ordinary citizens may reject.  The garda&iacute; recognise the strength of feeling of those involved in the protests and had no desire for a confrontation with them but, as guardians of the peace, they have a duty to see that the law is observed.</P>
        <P>Of course, carrying out this difficult duty is not helped by Deputies in this House who consistently act as if obeying the law is a matter of choice; that if persons do not approve of a law they have no obligation to obey it.  However it is dressed up, that approach flies in the face of democracy and the rule of law.  The Deputies are simply fooling those whom they claim to support by implying that a failure to obey the law will change the facts of the situation.</P>
        <P>The background to these most recent events is well known.  Further to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under EU law to protect rare and threatened habitats, it has been overwhelmingly clear for some time that turf cutting of Ireland&rsquo;s 53 raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs, could not continue.  The Government has put in place a compensation package for those affected, involving the option of a financial payment over 15 years or relocation.  This process is in place under the independently chaired Peatlands Council and I understand the vast majority of those concerned are engaging constructively along these lines, which is very much to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>My colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Jimmy Deenihan and Phil Hogan, have also met the European Commissioner for the Environment and secured his agreement that a national raised bog SAC management plan should be developed in the coming 12 months.  This was a major step forward and in keeping with a motion adopted in this House to which the Deputy referred.  The plan will be wide-ranging and address each of the 53 sites, looking at the practical aspects of conserving, restoring and managing the affected bogs.  It will also allow solutions for affected turf cutters to be explored in detail, including continued cutting in exceptional circumstances if the tests of the habitats directive can be met.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these developments and the unambiguous legal position, cutting has continued in a number of what seem to be organised instances.  This activity is misguided but I dare say encouraged by grandstanding by some Members in this House and elsewhere.  In these instances, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has a duty to uphold and enforce the law and has endeavoured to do so in a sensitive fashion and with care to avoid unnecessary confrontation.  The Garda has maintained close liaison with the service to ensure the law and public order are upheld.</P>
        <P>Turning to the events near Portumna, I understand the National Parks and Wildlife Service legally impounded some equipment at Clonmoylan bog giving rise to protest.  In view of the circumstances and the large number of people involved, a significant number of garda&iacute; have been present there to ensure the law is upheld.  Policing is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in situations such as that which occurred it is a matter for the Garda authorities to decide on the appropriate deployment of personnel and the relevant policing strategy.  As Minister, I have no direct role in such matters, but I have every confidence that the Garda has carried out its duties in a fully professional manner.</P>
        <P>The House will appreciate that the situation at Clonmoylan has evolved.  However, the latest briefing I received before coming into the Houses indicated that the Garda, in the discharge of its duties, had removed a piece of equipment for the purposes of technical examination, with a view to preparing a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  On conclusion of that examination it is intended to return the equipment to its owners on the basis that it will not be used in breach of the law.  I also understand the protest has ended.</P>
        <P>Neither the Garda nor the Government has any difficulty with peaceful protest, but people do not have a right to break the law or obstruct those implementing it.  I encourage those involved in protests to step back from unlawful activity and engage, as others have done, with the process in place.  The Government maintains an open door for engagement to find an accommodation for turf cutters within the law.  Apart from anything else, this would allow the Garda to get back to meeting the ordinary policing needs of communities, for which it has my support and that of the public at large.  It is a bit rich of the Deputy to make reference to garda&iacute; being deployed at this location where people were engaged in serious illegality and then criticise garda&iacute; for not being elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>I was not criticising the Garda at all and I certainly was not grandstanding.  I was wondering how the Minister for Justice and Equality could stand over a situation where people in my constituency in Malahide, Rush and other areas were bereft of Garda resources and yet at the drop of a hat, ordinary citizens in Galway could be met by 40 to 50 garda&iacute; at any one time assembled throughout the night.  The Minister made the point that laws had been breached, but he did not specify which laws had been breached.  What took place in Galway last night was a peaceful protest engaged in by ordinary citizens.  The response of the State forces &mdash; that is what they are &mdash; to an assembly on a country lane, of the armed response unit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>Perhaps the Deputy might refer to them as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>That means people who work for the State and who are armed were assembled against elderly, rural people who were out to cut turf.  Does the Minister deem this to be an acceptable practice that an armed response unit should be sent to respond to ordinary citizens engaged in peaceful protests?  That is the nub of the issue and what led to it.  The reality is that this House asked the Government to implement an arrangement and to seek a transitional arrangement in the European Union to allow turf cutters to continue to cut turf while an alternative plan was being constructed.  As everyone knows, it is now common knowledge that the Government did not do this.  The incidents last night were not incited by anyone; ordinary people were responding to the Government&rsquo;s lack of action on a decision made by this House.  That is where the responsibility lies.  If the Government thinks it can achieve things by heavy-handed tactics against ordinary citizens, I am sorry to say it is very much on the wrong path, as the turf cutters have been strengthened by the incident.  They are resolved to moving towards dialogue and a peaceful solution, but the Minister must meet them half way.  Carrying on the way the State did last night can only serve to alienate otherwise law-abiding and decent citizens.  I would like the Minister to answer the question on whether he will continue to use the armed response unit against peaceful protesters, be it on the issue of turf cutting or others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>As the Deputy well knows and as she said herself, the National Parks and Wildlife Service sought to remove equipment from the location in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>It was private property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>It did so in circumstances that were totally lawful and to enforce the laws of the State, but it was obstructed by the protesters from so doing.  The numbers who had accumulated at the location required a deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so as to ensure the law was upheld and appropriate steps were taken.  It is absolutely clear that what the Deputy and her colleagues are engaged in is provoking ordinary people to engage in conduct that is unnecessary and misleading them into believing the Government has not done everything possible at European Union level to implement the motion passed in this House, which is untrue.  It is time the Deputy and her colleagues in the Technical Group worked out whether they are parliamentary democrats or perpetual street protesters encouraging others to engage in protest.  Irrespective of the depth of feeling of those involved in protesting, we cannot have a situation where implementation of the law is compromised.  Members who are elected as legislators have a particular duty to enforce laws either passed by this Parliament or that the State is obliged to meet as a member of the European Union.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  One cannot be both a law breaker and a law maker or encourage others while one is a law maker to break the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister answer the question he was asked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>At a national level it is clear that a failure to fully implement EU environmental law in this area leaves the State open to significant fines which could amount to &euro;25,000 a day.  The European Commission is being vigilant in its monitoring of the situation.  All members of the community will be at a loss if fines are imposed.  I hope those involved in illegal turf cutting will reflect again on these consequences.  I again encourage them to cease such cutting attempts and avoid further confrontation of the nature we saw last night.  The Government maintains an open door for engagement on the basis that we can work together to find an accommodation within the law for turf cutters.  I acknowledge and thank the many people who have worked with us in this regard.  I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work in which it was engaged last night and I am pleased to note the protest is over.  I hope we will not see a repetition of similar protests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
        <P>I hope not.  If the Minister engages with people, we will not.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure, the Government decided to reduce the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF to 9,500 personnel.  The savings arising from this decision and those arising from broader reductions in the number of public servants were required to meet fiscal consolidation targets which are a key component of the EU-IMF programme.  In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major reorganisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  This is to ensure the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces is prioritised within the available resources.</P>
        <P>A three brigade structure has been retained since the strength of the PDF was reduced to 11,500 and is no longer viable within a reduced strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.  Accordingly, the re-organisation encompasses a reduction in the number of Army brigades from the current three to two.</P>
        <P>I tasked the Chief of Staff and Secretary General of my Department with bringing forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  It is important that time be permitted for the completion of the preparatory work and for consideration of the range of outstanding issues.  I have received regular updates on progress and I expect to receive a final report from the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff in the near future.</P>
        <P>It has been my stated intention to refrain from commenting on the re-organisation until this work is complete.  However, I found it necessary in recent days to clarify the position with regard to Custume Barracks in Athlone.  This was required to dispel an ongoing campaign of misinformation and misleading speculation that suggested falsely that removal of the brigade headquarters would result in 600 personnel being withdrawn from the barracks.  I clarified this matter by announcing that the brigade headquarters for the two new brigades would be located in Cork and Dublin and that this decision would have minimal impact on strength levels in Custume Barracks.  The fact is there are approximately 1,050 Defence Forces personnel currently based in the barracks.  Following the re-organisation, there will be approximately 1,000 Defence Forces personnel remaining in the barracks.  This decision and the announcement regarding the brigade headquarters were informed by an interim report received by me from the Chief of Staff and Secretary General.  I have no intention of revisiting this decision.</P>
        <P>As with any reform or re-organisation, individuals may be concerned about the potential impact upon them.  Any change arising will be encompassed within the scope of the broader public service reform programme and the Croke Park agreement.  The Deputies will appreciate that consideration of detailed questions must await the completion of the preparatory work and final decisions.  This includes questions regarding final organisational structures, rank distributions and implementation issues, such as movements of personnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  His decision has been seven months in preparation.  He issued his letter to the Chief of Staff on 5 December and today is supposed to be the longest day of the year, believe it or not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>That makes it the shortest night as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>It was actually brighter on 5 December when the Minister made his announcement.  Why was the western brigade chosen to be left behind in the new arrangement?  The personnel serving in Custume Barracks want to know how many of them will be moved out of the barracks.  If he decided to reduce the number of brigades in what he termed a cost-cutting measure, surely he cannot expect the House to believe that only 50 members of the Defence Forces will move out of the barracks.  Few costs would be saved.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister confirm that 1,400 positions, regardless of whether they are filled, are attached to Custume Barracks?  I gather that, when speaking on local radio in the midlands during the week, the Minister stated that Custume Barracks would not be large enough for so many people.  It was not Deputies on this side of the House who stated they had no confidence in the Minister, rather it was one of his colleagues.  From local Deputies, including some members of the Minister&rsquo;s party, I gather Custume Barracks is well able to house that number of people.  During the debate in the House in the run-up to the closure of the barracks in Mullingar, the Minister assured us Custume Barracks was more than capable of taking in personnel from Mullingar.</P>
        <P>That these are the last Department of Defence priority questions in this session presents a difficulty.  We will not have a chance to question the Minister again until September.  When will the information be shared with the House and with those affected in Custume Barracks?  Will we have a chance to question the Minister on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I regret the Deputy has been misled by his colleague, Deputy Troy, who has been running a campaign around Athlone, calling public meetings with his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>Deputy Bannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;suggesting, first, that the barracks was to close, which was untrue, and second, that 600 personnel were to be removed from the barracks.  When that also turned out to be untrue and I made it clear the barracks would have in or about 1,000 personnel at the end of the re-organisation, he went around telling everyone there were either 1,400 or 1,450 personnel in the barracks.  I noticed with some interest that Deputy Calleary phrased it as the barracks having the capacity to have 1,400, even if they are not there at the moment.  Let me enlighten him.  Throughout the period when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government over the past ten years, Custume Barracks never had 1,400 personnel.  It does not have 1,400 personnel today, it did not have that many when the Deputy&rsquo;s party left government and it did not have that many when his party was in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>How many will it have when the Minister is out of government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>This is a complete fabrication.  When the current Government took up office on 9 March 2011, there were just over 900 personnel in Custume Barracks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government closed the barracks in Mullingar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister stated he would not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>Today, there are 1,050 personnel in Custume Barracks, 34 of whom are currently abroad on duties but who remain attached to Custume Barracks.  There are no mythical 350 extra personnel &mdash; they feature in Deputy Troy&rsquo;s imagination &mdash; and there never have been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister should speak with his backbencher, who considers that the Minister is using the barracks as a kicking post.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The practical reality is that, when this re-organisation is implemented, Custume Barracks will end up with approximately 100 more personnel than were there on 9 March 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>Was a cost-benefit analysis of the decision to move the brigade headquarters out of Custume Barracks undertaken?  When will the changes indicated by the Minister be fully implemented?  Will the savings that might be made be re-invested in the Defence Forces, as was the case previously when major savings, barrack closures and so on occurred?  The Minister claims the change in strength will only be 50 personnel.  Next year, we will determine whether the Minister held to a reduction of only 50 personnel.  I do not believe he will.  When will the changes be fully implemented, was a cost-benefit analysis conducted and will the savings be re-invested?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I very much welcome the new era of politics in which we are currently engaged.  That Sinn F&eacute;in is now showing such considerable support for the Defence Forces is a very important and welcome development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister is in good form today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The monetary savings have been delivered through the reduction in personnel strength and are reflected in the 2012 budget.  The provision for the Permanent Defence Force&rsquo;s pay in the Vote 36 Estimates in 2011 was just over &euro;442 million.  The corresponding provision for 2012 is &euro;425 million.  The re-organisation will absorb the reduction in numbers and improve operational effectiveness.  The reduction in the number of brigades from three to two will free up military personnel from administrative and support functions.</P>
        <P>The reality is, at a time when we had 11,500 personnel in the Defence Forces, a three brigade structure made sense.  At a time when we have 9,500 personnel in the Defence Forces, a two brigade structure makes sense.  What this is about is ensuring the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces and that they are deployed in a manner that is in the public interest and maximises their effectiveness, both in assisting the civil power in their duties in this State and in facilitating their undertaking of international duties.</P>
        <P>What is also of particular importance at a time when we have reduced numbers in the Defence Forces is that we have a reasonable proportion between enlisted personnel and officers and that we do not have disproportionate numbers among the higher ranks compared with enlisted personnel.  This re-organisation and the decisions made by this Government have had the effect of facilitating a recruitment campaign to the Defence Forces for an additional 600 personnel this year and they have provided for more effective Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might be interested to know the Government announced two decisions in December.  First, personnel numbers during the course of this year would be brought up and maintained at 9,500.  Second, we would move from a three brigade to a two brigade structure.  Those particular decisions guaranteed we would have proper numbers within the Defence Forces in order that they could effectively undertake their functions.  I am quite pleased to inform the House that we were, unfortunately, heading down a route where, as a result of the manner in which the Defence Forces were being funded and dealt with when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, there was a risk that numbers within the Defence Forces could have fallen below 8,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Thank you, Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>We made very important decisions to protect the numbers in the Defence Forces and we used its establishment to the maximum efficiency and capability.  What we are now implementing is the agreed portion of the re-organisation as agreed by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of my Department.  As to when we will have the final detail of this, I cannot give an exact date but it will be within the next few weeks.  Some final work is still being done on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>Why was such a fundamental decision about the re-organisation of the Army taken outside of the Green Paper process?  That process is there to design a roadmap for our Defence Forces for the next ten years.  Again, the Minister has not answered the question as to why the Western Brigade was chosen for abolition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>My understanding is that there was a commitment to prepare a new White Paper in the previous programme for Government.  It is also my understanding that the previous Government had no difficulty with initiating a re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force at that stage to accommodate a strength reduction to 10,000 in advance of that process.  The reality was when we came into government, the strength was going to fall substantially below that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister answer the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The priority is the maintenance of the operational capability of the Defence Forces within a reduced resource envelope to underpin the re-organisation.  In these circumstances, I cannot understand how it is now suggested that it is necessary to await the publication of the Green Paper and the outcome of any White Paper.  The organisational structures that were outmoded at 10,000 are even more outmoded at 9,500 personnel.  I am determined to ensure the Defence Forces are re-organised to reflect the current strength ceiling as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The process of preparing a Green Paper on defence has commenced.  A broad consultative process will be initiated upon its publication.  This is planned for the end of the year.  It is neither feasible nor prudent to wait until the White Paper is finalised in 2013 and only in 2014 to initiate a re-organisation of the Defence Forces to ensure they are able to operate to their maximum efficiency and capability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.  This was a key consideration of the Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.  As with previous rounds of consolidation under the Defence Forces modernisation programme, barracks, once vacated, are being disposed of with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks closed on 30 March 2012 have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million per annum.  In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum arising from utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the Government&rsquo;s decision on barrack closures, my Department has written to each Department, various agencies and local authorities seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.  As a result, I can confirm that agreement has been reached with Mayo County Council for the purchase of Mitchell Barracks, Castlebar.  The council has already taken over the property under a caretaker agreement pending full completion of the necessary legal paperwork to complete the transfer of title.</P>
        <P>There have also been discussions between officials from my Department and a number of other State agencies on the sale of  Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, and Cavan.  However, these discussions are still ongoing.  Some discussion has also taken place on Mullingar Barracks but no substantial progress has been made towards achieving a sale.  Every effort will be made to dispose of the barracks so as to maximise the benefits to the local community.</P>
        <P>When barracks close, there is an onus on my Department to provide necessary security and undertake maintenance and upkeep as required.  Security fencing is under way at some of the barracks at a total estimated cost of &euro;130,000.  Temporary additional security measures have also been put in place at a cost of &euro;40,000 to date.  Out of those figures approximately &euro;36,000 has been spent on Kickham Barracks.</P>
        <P>Regarding Reserve Defence Force premises in Clonmel, a property has been identified.  Several minor issues have arisen with the lease which are being addressed, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I asked a specific question about Kickham Barracks and the Minister has bundled it in with others which I am not happy about.  He also gave only one figure of &euro;36,000 when the question requested three figures.  He did not even answer the last part of the question on the relocation of the Garda station in Clonmel.  The garda&iacute; based there are working in a hovel, a third world premises which is not fit for purpose of any shape, make or form and access for the public is disgraceful.  Will he reply to that part of the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Could the Deputy complete his question because I have to bring in the other Deputies who put down questions on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>There were three parts to that detailed question and the Minister only answered one.  He often talks about my ramblings but they were put down on paper to him.  He had time to answer them but he failed.  He is more interested in jibes at Fianna F&aacute;il and the Technical Group, for which he seems to have an obsession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The issue of Kickham Barracks and the relocation of Clonmel Garda station is being discussed in the context of the disposal of the barracks.  I am conscious of the condition of the Garda station in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister come down to see it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>There is a particular problem, however, which is that the Office of Public Works has substantially less funding available to it for the construction of new Garda stations as a consequence of the destruction of our fiscal base&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister answer the question and forget about the past?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
        <P>Please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the previous Government, a Government for which Deputy Mattie McGrath was happy to vote and of which he was part.</P>
        <P>Regard has been taken of relocation of the Garda station to the Clonmel barracks.  I hope and believe discussions that are taking place on this matter will come to a successful outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>We had debates with the Minister with his justice hat on the threat posed by dissident republican activity.  There have been several serious incidents since the decision was taken to close Cavan Barracks.  Given this threat, we may need a military presence on the Border.  Will the Minister agree that Cavan Barracks, given its location, would be the most ideal place for such a presence?</P>
        <P>In discussions with various groups the Minister met regarding the barracks in Mullingar, he mentioned there was potentially an interest from a foreign third level institution.  Has that progressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>That interest was a possibility but, unfortunately, those in top management at the particular institution changed.  It seems the interest has fallen away.  We were hoping something beneficial to the area would come of that.  Unfortunately, that interest does not seem to be there.  I did say when I mentioned it that I did not want to give rise to any unreal expectations as it was an initial interest.</P>
        <P>On the basis of advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Army&rsquo;s Chief of Staff, I am satisfied that both the Garda and Defence Forces are adequately positioned to take any action that may be necessary and have the capability to do so should there be some issue or incident with dissident republican activity that gives rise to concern.  As the Deputy knows, there is a good relationship, with maximum co-operation, between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in dealing with a broad range of security issues.  That will continue.  The Army is only engaged as a backup to the civil power should the need arise, and the chief of staff is quite satisfied that any eventuality that could occur can be properly addressed based on the current barracks and the manner in which the Defence Forces are currently deployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister confirm the interest of South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee in part of Kickham Barracks?  The committee has a building immediately adjacent to the barracks and I know it has an interest in a small portion of the site, together with the north block.  I support Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s comments regarding relocation of the Garda barracks.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister mentioned a figure of approximately &euro;36,000 for security costs for Kickham Barracks.  Is that the correct figure?  Will the Minister confirm the tendering process in place for that work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>There was none.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister outline if the process was adhered to in that case?  I have previously raised the matter of a memorial plaque for Company Sergeant Felix Grant, and his son Felix, known as Tony, has been in contact with the Department.  He was also a member of the Defence Forces, and he has indicated the family&rsquo;s preference to have the memorial plaque back in Clonmel.  Will the Minister confirm the position of the plaque?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I know there have been discussions about the plaque, which was removed for safe keeping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>I hope it is not scrap metal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>Officials from the Department are happy to be engaged in discussions and if an appropriate arrangement can be agreed, I would be happy to be of assistance.  Some further work needs to be done on the matter.</P>
        <P>I confirm that among the groups or individuals which have shown an interest in the barracks is the VEC.  I understand discussions are ongoing in that context and I am optimistic that there will be some fruitful development from those discussions.  I do not want to pre-empt decisions and I am conscious that there is some way to go on that issue, which involves not just decisions by the VEC and the Department of Defence but matters that must be addressed by the Department of Education and Skills.  There has been constructive engagement and I would welcome progress.</P>
        <P>As I was saying to Deputy McGrath when Deputy Healy came into the House, I am conscious, wearing the two hats I have, of the need for a new Garda station.  I also know that a portion of the barracks could provide a very good location for a new Garda station.  The difficulty is that the Office of Public Works, OPW, the group within the Government which funds the construction of Garda stations, has very limited available funding.  We are giving serious consideration to facilitating the reservation of space that would help in building a Garda station at a time when funding becomes available.  We are anxious not to make decisions that would create a difficulty in that context but, unfortunately, in current financial circumstances a number of Garda stations are required in various parts of the State as a consequence of others either being in poor condition or not meeting the needs of areas that have seen expansion.  A number of these projects will be put on hold for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Will the Minister visit Clonmel Garda station?  From discussions with the Garda, I understand it would need a good portion of the 11-acre site, perhaps five acres or more.  The Department owns the site so it is important that the Minister ring-fence it and make the site available.  We can deal with the OPW at another stage and do our best.  I also support the VEC using the location.  I am fearful that vandalism will occur and the site will go into disrepair.  This is a prime location in pristine condition and I hope it will not be like the Army barracks in Kildare, which is horrifying to see.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply implies that no tender process was carried out for the provision of security, and local security firms are very annoyed because they did not get the opportunity to tender.  Will the Minister confirm that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response with regard to the VEC and the Garda, as well as the information on the memorial plaque.  Is it correct that &euro;36,000 has been spent to date on security for the barracks?  Will the Minister inform us of the tendering process?  Was it adhered to for Kickham Barracks?  What will be the cost of securing this new building for the Reserve Defence Forces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>It strikes me that the Minister is trying to achieve some kind of solution for putting a Garda barracks in the old Army barracks in Clonmel.  There is a high proportion of unemployment in south Tipperary, with many of those unemployed including craftspeople.  In the 1980s, AnCO was able to complete some superb State buildings.  Would it be possible, in conjunction with the OPW and Department of Social Protection, to get it done in a cost-effective way with a pilot scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
        <P>Where Tipperary leads, others follow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>If a new Garda station is to be built, a substantial capital outlay must be incurred.  We must have a state-of-the-art station meeting all the operational necessities of modern policing and we cannot have a jerry-built sticking plaster of a building.  I know the Deputy is not suggesting that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>The core building is there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>There is currently no funding.  I could take the Deputy around the country and point out where we need new Garda stations but the funding is not there.  We need planning for the process and I will not pretend that the money for it exists, although I wish it did.  I wish we had the sort of capital allocations that existed in years gone by as I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that if we were able to fund projects of this nature, it would contribute to employment.  We are dependent on funding from the EU and IMF and we are required to reduce expenditure across a broad range of areas.  Unfortunately, I cannot produce by magic money that does not exist.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I assure Deputies that there are security arrangements for Kickham Barracks and there is no possibility of a repeat of some of the events which took place in Kildare.  Frankly, the previous Government did not do what was necessary to properly secure that property.  It was temporarily made available to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the previous Government and when it ceased using it, the barracks was not adequately secured.  We took immediate steps to secure all four vacated barracks and did what was necessary to avoid the problems quite properly pointed out by Deputy McGrath as occurring in Kildare.  That is the interest not simply of the State in reserving its assets but also the local communities.  I hope that within a reasonable period, the barracks in Cavan and Clonmel will change ownership and there will be developments of benefit to the local community.</P>
        <P>I am concerned there is not the same level of interest yet in Mullingar.  I hope in what we are doing we will stimulate that interest.</P>
        <P>In the intervening period, we will ensure the barracks are properly secured as assets to the State and I will do what I can as Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with my colleague in the Office of Public Works, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to push forward where it is possible the construction of new Garda stations.  This is an issue Deputy Tom Hayes has raised with me on a regular basis and I am fully aware of the local position.  He has expressed concern about developments in Clonmel and has directly engaged with some of the groups that have visited the barracks in Clonmel with a view to acquiring portions of the barracks for projects that would be of benefit to the local community.</P>

        <QRef>[29850/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, arising from the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive review of expenditure, the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced to 9,500 personnel.  In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  This re-organisation will encompass a reduction in the number of Army brigades from the current three to two.  A three brigade structure was no longer viable within a reduced strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.</P>
        <P>The priority is on maintaining the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force to the greatest extent possible within this reduced strength ceiling.  This will be achieved through rationalising administrative and support functions and rebalancing force elements.  As I have previously outlined, I requested the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General to bring forward proposals for my consideration.  It had been my stated preference to await the submission of final proposals before making any announcements.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I found it necessary to clarify the position with regard to Custume Barracks to dispel the ongoing campaign of misinformation and misleading speculation which suggested falsely that the removal of the brigade headquarters would result in some 600 personnel being withdrawn from the barracks.  I have recently clarified that the two new brigades will have their headquarters located in Cork and Dublin.  I have again confirmed that Custume Barracks will not be closed and that within an overall strength of 9,500, the reorganisation will see numbers serving in Custume Barracks remaining in the order of 1,000 personnel. This firmly rebuffs the misinformation regarding the impact of the withdrawal of the brigade headquarters from Custume Barracks.</P>
        <P>Despite my reassurances that the numbers based in the barracks will not be reduced by any significant margin, it has been incorrectly stated, in this House and elsewhere, that this decision represents a loss of 400 jobs from Custume Barracks.  This is without foundation and misleading.  The strength ceiling of the PDF is 9,500 and it is impossible to lose jobs that simply are not there.  There are not 1,400 personnel based in Athlone; no such number were based there during the life of the previous Government and Custume Barracks, as presently constituted, could not accommodate such numbers.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the re-organisation, there will be movement of functions and personnel within and between barracks.  As with any reform or reorganisation, individuals may be concerned about the potential impact upon them.  Any changes arising will be encompassed within the scope of the broader public service reform programme and Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff are continuing their work to finalise proposals on the re-organisation.  I look forward to receiving and considering these final proposals. The Deputy will appreciate that I will not be in a position to answer further questions regarding the re-organisation until this process is complete.  Nevertheless, I felt it important to clarify the position on brigade headquarters last week because the misinformation in the constituency is causing upset generally in Athlone and was unfair to members of the Defence Forces and their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Can the Minister confirm approximately 200 staff currently based in Athlone will have to be redeployed to other barracks around the country because of the bizarre decision to downgrade Custume Barracks?  On 31 January in a parliamentary reply to me, the Minister stated there were 937 personnel in Custume Barracks, both civilian and military, and it was projected that figure would increase by 278 when Mullingar and Cavan Barracks closed.  The commitment is now that there will be an additional 63 personnel in Custume Barracks.  The Minister has received the report from the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff.  Did that report recommend the downgrading of Custume Barracks in Athlone and did it recommend that 1,000 personnel would be maintained in Athlone?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The interim report from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department recommended the brigade headquarters would be based in Cork and Dublin.  I was interested in the Deputy&rsquo;s figures.  He asked if 200 members currently based in Athlone will be transferred along with their families.  In the context of the reorganisation, no one will lose his job.  There are no figures to indicate 200 members of the Defence Forces based in Athlone will be moved from there.  The effect of the reorganisation will be that there will be approximately 1,000 members remaining in the barracks in Athlone.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>From time to time, however, members of the Defence Forces are transferred from one barracks to another or they assume new duties or are promoted and as a consequence there is always movement within the Defence Forces.  It would be quite extraordinary if the 1,000 who are there today, including 34 currently on international duty, were never to move out of Athlone.  The position is that there will not be 500 or 600 members of the Defence Forces moved out of the barracks in Athlone.  The exact modalities for implementing the reorganisation are a continuing part of the discussion between the Chief of Staff and my Secretary General involving those working under them.  I look forward to receiving their final report and the position remains that the future of Custume Barracks is absolutely secure and the barracks will continue to play an important role in the western region.</P>
        <P>The figures the Deputy mentioned were up to the end of February, when there were various changes as members resigned.  The position as I described it was that there were just over 900 on 9 March 2011 based in the barracks.  The numbers then changed as a consequence of retirements and transfers from Mullingar to Cavan and from Mullingar to Athlone and from Cavan to Athlone.  The correct figure now is 1,050.  It could be 1,052 because the world changes on a daily basis in the Defence Forces and the bottom line in all of this is that when the reorganisation is implemented, there will be in or around 1,000 individuals based in the barracks.  There might be one day when there are 1,002 individuals and 999 the next day because there is always some level of movement between barracks, which is why I am constantly saying &ldquo;in or about&rdquo;, but that does not mean &ldquo;in or about&rdquo; will be dramatically different from 1,000.</P>
        <P>I regret people have been misinformed and there has been a campaign of misinformation and lobbying by some individuals on this matter.  I must have regard to the interests of the country and the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his response to my questions.  The Minister has answered them all, bar one: did the interim report recommend in or about 1,000 personnel to maintained in Custume Barracks, Athlone?  Does the Minister agree, based on a back of the envelope calculation, that approximately 650 staff will be based in each of the five barracks in the Northern Brigade?  If 1,000 personnel will be based in Custume Barracks, Athlone, one of the other four barracks within the brigade will lose out.  That does not take into account the number required for brigade headquarters staffing.  The figures do not add up and I ask the Minister to clarify them.  He stated during the previous Question Time that he did not want to pre-empt a decision by the chief of staff and his Secretary General.  He has done that by making the announcement for whatever reason.  The people of Athlone are disappointed that the barracks is losing brigade status and that the 4th Western Brigade is being lost from the barracks and they want answers to these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
        <P>The figures I used are the same as those used by the Minister&rsquo;s backbench colleagues.  One of them said he was tired of the Government using the midlands &ldquo;as a kicking post&rdquo;.  This is the first time in Athlone&rsquo;s history the barracks will be without a brigadier general.  Se&aacute;n MacEoin was the first brigadier general there.</P>
        <P>Was a cost benefit analysis conducted?  If so, will he publish same?  He failed, despite repeated questioning earlier and on Midlands 103 last Friday morning &mdash; he gave me numerous mentions for which I thank him &mdash; to outline which units will remain and which will be transferred.  He is unable to say which units will remain and, therefore, I do not know how he can guarantee the 1,000 jobs.  Will he apologise to the people of Athlone because they did not consider this to be a good news story for the town?  Will the meet the members of Athlone Town Council?  The mayor, Councillor Alan Shaw, is a colleague of the Minister&rsquo;s and he has requested a meeting but has so far failed to get a reply.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s figures are all over the shop, as Deputy Naughten said.  In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister said the number based in the barracks is 937 and he expected that to increase by more than 270 to give a total of 1,215, but earlier he said the total number would be 1,050.  I do not know whether he knows the figure.</P>
        <P>The reason there are more Army personnel in Custume Barracks after a year of Fine Gael in government is it closed Columb Barracks, Mullingar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy is a little confused.  He cannot make up his mind about how many personnel he wants stationed in Athlone.  I would have thought in the context of the town that the important issue is that approximately 1,000 personnel will be based in the barracks, which is 100 more than were there when we took office on 9 March 2011.  Those members and their families contribute to the town&rsquo;s economy.  I do not imagine that those engaged in business in the town are losing sleep about whether a brigadier general will be based in the barracks.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and perhaps he will do me the courtesy of not interrupting me.  It is a great pity the Deputy ran a grossly misleading campaign.  He first told people that 600 members would be transferred out of the barracks and, second, he laboured under the illusion that 1,400 personnel were based there.

        <P>The Deputy would not have had as many people at his public meeting if he announced it was a public meeting to ensure that forever more a brigadier general would be based in Athlone.  I say that with the greatest respect for the current brigadier general but there is an inordinate concern as to where he should be posted.  The important thing for the town is that the future of the barracks is secure and approximately 1,000 members of the Defence Forces will be based there.</P>

        <P>The misinformation that went around the area was such that I felt the need to clarify the position with regard to the location of brigade headquarters and to give assurances that there would be no substantial reduction in personnel, as was being stated.</P>
        <P>In the context of the question Deputy Naughten asked, I will not second guess the ongoing work and I will not go around each barracks to announce how many individuals will be based in them.  I am concerned to ensure that the process the chief of staff and those under him, together with my Secretary General and those assisting him in my Department, are engaged in continues and is completed; that changes to be announced are properly communicated to members of the Defence Forces in individual barracks; and that we engage with the Defence Forces representatives organisations.  It was unfortunate that, because of the type of campaign run by Deputy Troy, we had to make the announcement we made but we felt it was important because the rumours going around and the campaign run by him, which was playing politics with the Defence Forces, were causing a great deal of concern unfairly to those members based in Athlone.</P>

        <P>Ireland has offered, through the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time. This demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.  Ireland is currently contributing 440 Defence Forces personnel to 12 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following table. </P>
        <P>The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 356 personnel, the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo with 12 personnel, the EU Training Mission, EUTM, Somalia with ten personnel, the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with seven personnel, and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan with seven personnel.</P>
        <P>Ireland will participate with 175 Defence Forces personnel in the Austro-German led battlegroup which will be on standby from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012.  Ireland has received an invitation from the operational commander of operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA to contribute an autonomous vessel protection detachment, AVPD, to the operation.  The Department is considering whether it will be in a position to do so.</P>
        <P>Over the past two years, Irish personnel serving with KFOR in Kosovo and the EU-led Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been drawn down in line with the Government decision in December 2009 to scale back Defence Forces commitments to overseas peace support operations as one of the budgetary expenditure reduction measures.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>Planning for the deployment of a contingent of the Finnish armed forces with the Irish battalion in UNIFIL has been ongoing over the past number of months.  This has culminated in the formation of a joint Irish/Finnish battalion in UNIFIL, which became fully operational with effect from 1 June 2012.  The deployment of the Finnish contingent with the Irish battalion has resulted in the rationalisation of the Irish contribution to UNIFIL from 454 to 356 Defence Forces personnel.  Subject to renewal of the mission mandate by the UN Security Council, it is proposed to maintain this level of commitment to UNIFIL for the next three years.  There are no plans for any major reductions in the Defence Forces current commitments to overseas peace support operations at this time.  The current contribution of some 440 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.   This gives us an opportunity to place on record our appreciation to all those serving abroad for the fantastic work they do on the various missions they participate in on behalf of the country.  I also send best wishes to their families.</P>
        <P>I appreciate there is a question about Syria later but does the Minister expect to have to make commitments to large scale deployments of troops in the next while?  A total of 356 personnel are deployed in the Lebanon.  How many is it envisaged will participate in that mission over the next 18 months to two years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>We are jointly engaged with a Finnish contingent in the Lebanon and that is envisaged to be the position for some little time.</P>
        <P>With regard to Syria, in the context of the six point plan that Kofi Annan has been engaged with arising out of UN decisions, six members of the Defence Forces are engaged as monitors in an overall contingent of 300.  I had particular concerns about the safety of the monitors given the manner in which that conflict was continuing.  The sad reality is that the six-point plan has not worked to date.  Moreover, there is no indication that the murderous campaign being waged by the Assad regime against its own citizens is coming to an end or that the groups opposed to the regime have any intention of laying down their arms.  The unfortunate reality is that the level of violence has escalated since our monitors travelled to Syria.  The role of these personnel, who are unarmed, was to have overseen matters following the ending of violence.  As matters stand, all of the monitors are stationed in headquarters and are not conducting monitoring activities.  I have conveyed my concerns regarding the safety of our personnel.  The engagement was initially expected to last 90 days, which means it will come to an end around 20 July unless it is renewed by the United Nations.</P>
        <P>It is my hope that the conflict in Syria will cease, the monitors can perform the function for which they were deployed and the Kofi Annan plan will be successful, but I am not optimistic it will happen.  My position is that our monitors should only remain in place if they have a proper role to play in maintaining peace.  I am keeping the situation under review on a day-to-day basis and receiving regular reports on how matters are proceeding.  Unfortunately, the barbarity of the conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of many thousands of individuals, does not give rise to optimism that the violence will end soon.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15, 18, 20, 22 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>Malaria is a serious disease which can cause severe complications and death.  It is estimated by the World Health Organisation that approximately 1 million people die every year from the disease in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It has long been recognised as a serious threat to any military force operating in a malarious area.</P>
        <P>Lariam is a malaria chemoprophylactic agent first authorised for use in 1989 by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, which is the statutory regulatory body charged with regulating the use of medicines in Ireland to ensure their quality, safety and efficacy.  Research has shown that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in FDA drug safety newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the IMB remains of the view that the benefit-risk profile for the product was acceptable.  The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate.  Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the IMB.</P>
        <P>In accordance with best international practice in prescribing Lariam, and taking account of the contraindications, warnings and side effects highlighted by the IMB, the Defence Forces screen all personnel for medical suitability.  The screening system rules out staff with certain conditions, including depression, anxiety and neurodegenerative disorders, from overseas services.  These are the conditions which, as has been indicated by the IMB and other regulatory bodies worldwide, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  In addition, personnel who are found suitable for Lariam are obliged to commence their medication three to four weeks in advance of their travel.  This precaution allows a slow build-up of the medication in the bloodstream and also permits assessment by the person of his or her individual reaction to the medication while still in Ireland.  Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Lariam use are not prescribed the medication.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the primary area of operations for United States forces is currently Afghanistan.  Neither the United States army nor the Irish Defence Forces recommend Lariam as a first-line malaria chemoprophylaxis for Afghanistan.  Another factor to consider is that while the United States military engaged in mass prescribing, the Defence Forces, in accordance with the prescribing instructions, consider each individual case.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the military authorities that three members of the Defence Forces displayed a serious symptomatology which may have been caused or contributed to by Lariam, although there is nothing conclusive in this regard.  I am also advised that all three personnel made a full recovery and their cases were reported to the IMB.  I am further advised by the director of the Defence Forces medical corps that he is unaware of any suicide by a member of the Defence Forces linked to Lariam.</P>
        <P>No personnel have been discharged because they were below Defence Forces medical standards as a result of taking Lariam.  I am informed that the number of personnel deemed unsuitable for Lariam due to contraindications cannot be quantified without an examination of every medical file, which would be impractical.  Likewise, the number of personnel to whom Lariam was administered cannot be accurately established without an examination of every file.  I have asked the military authorities to provide an estimate of this number based on the number of personnel who served on certain missions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>It is difficult to believe, in this computer era, that the number of personnel deployed in the sub-Saharan region who were administered Lariam cannot be quantified.  Given the concerns that have been expressed by serving soldiers and ex-soldiers in regard to this medicine, those data should be compiled without delay.  Will the Minister give a commitment, in advance of any future deployment in sub-Saharan Africa, that a review of the drug and its administration in the Defence Forces will be undertaken?  Its use as an anti-malaria drug has been discontinued in the armed forces of many countries on the basis of its severe side effects, which include suicide and suicidal tendencies.  The Minister indicated that three Defence Forces personnel have been identified as suffering side effects after taking the drug but that it is very difficult to say conclusively whether any staff committed suicide as a reaction to Lariam.  That would indeed be difficult to quantify if the question of whether Lariam had been administered was not considered by the medical officer who conducted the examination of personnel who died through suicide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board determines the safety or otherwise of all medicines prescribed in this State.  The board is appointed by the Minister for Health and its advisory committee on human medicines has a statutory role to provide advice in cases where it is proposed to refuse a licence for medicinal products on any grounds relating to safety, quality or efficacy.  Following approval for use of a medicine, the IMB monitors the type and frequency of any reported side effects.  As product usage increases, more information on the safety profile becomes available and further decisions and recommendations regarding its usage are made by the IMB and its international counterparts.  The Defence Forces fully comply with IMB guidelines on the prescribing of medicines for members.</P>
        <P>At present, no members of the Defence Forces are deployed in sub-Saharan Africa and there is no immediate plan for any such deployment.  The fact remains that for certain types of malaria, Lariam is the treatment of choice.  It is important that members of the Defence Forces who are deployed to areas where they are at risk of contracting the type of malaria for which Lariam is recommended as the appropriate treatment by the IMB, should have the drug available to them.  The alternative, which I pointed out, is that in sub-Saharan Africa alone, there are 1 million deaths per annum arising from malaria, so this is not an issue of minor significance.  I have no intention of sending nor wish to send members of the Defence Forces into harm&rsquo;s way in circumstances in which medicines are available to provide them with crucial protection.  What was a failing in some defence forces elsewhere, including the United States defence forces, was that procedures were not in place whereby individual members of the defence forces were assessed as to the appropriateness of them being prescribed Lariam.</P>
        <P>There are the contra-indications I mentioned.  When a medical assessment is carried out and if there is an issue as to whether someone suffers from depression, may be taking medication for depression or has other difficulties which are contra-indications, it is very important that the member of the Defence Forces furnishes the medical doctor undertaking the assessment with the fullest information about his or her health.  It is extremely dangerous should he or she not do so.  That is the position.</P>
        <P>I have no wish that anything would be done which would place at risk the health of members of the Defence Forces, nor could I stand over our posting members of the Defence Forces to an area of the world in which malaria is a serious risk without our relying on the best medical advice available to ensure they had whatever medical assistance was necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>One of the questions was about personnel who were administered Lariam but who were deemed unsuitable.  There are people who might have depression and for whom the administration of Lariam might be deemed unsuitable.  From my knowledge, few, if any, were deemed unsuitable for deployment based on the fact they would have to take Lariam and had some underlying ailment which might have reacted to it.</P>
        <P>I have not only sought a review from this Minister but also raised the matter with the previous Minister for Defence.  There are a number of cases of concern and that is why I raise the issue of Lariam.  Given that we have the luxury of not having a deployment to sub-Saharan Africa in the near future, a review could take place on the use of Lariam and whether the alternatives would be more suitable.  One of the alternatives needs to be administered more regularly and the belief is that is the reason it was rejected.  Others said there was a cost implication.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Minister and the previous Minister a range of questions about Lariam and to ensure the medical advice is not wrong.  The Irish Medicines Board cannot act unless it has the information.  The Defence Forces have not acted properly in regard to serving and former members of the Defence Forces who have raised a concern about Lariam.  Can the Minister confirm that all such issues have been reported to the Irish Medicines Board by the Defence Forces?</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P>I do not know on what basis the Deputy is alleging the Defence Forces have not acted properly in regard to this matter.  It is important to look at the alternatives to Lariam.  There are three other anti-malaria medications available, namely, Chloroquine, Malarone and Doxycycline.  However, in the case of each of these products, there are specific reasons they are not suitable for use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa and it is worthwhile setting out these reasons.  Chloroquine is no longer in use because of the development of widespread resistance to it.  Doxycycline must be taken in the absence of dairy products and it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in sunny climates.  For this reason, it is not recommended for first-line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  Malarone is unsuitable for use as it is licensed for no more than 28 days continuous use in malarious areas by the Irish Medicines Board.  In this context, this prophylactic agent is only suitable for use where the overseas deployment does not exceed 28 days.</P>
        <P>These are among the reasons Lariam remains the anti-malaria chemoprophylactic agent of choice in areas where the predominant species of malaria is the virulent <i>plasmodium falciparum</i>.  Lariam, therefore, is the agent of first choice on any sub-Saharan missions undertaken by the Defence Forces and that remains the position.</P>
        <P>Doxycycline is the anti-malaria chemoprophylactic agent of choice in Afghanistan where the predominant species of malaria is the less virulent <i>plasmodium vivax</i>.  Where Lariam is not required to be used, it is not used because it is not necessary to use it as a chemoprophylactic agent.  In the context of sub-Saharan Africa, the alternatives do not offer our Defence Forces the protections to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>It is not practical to undertake a review of every file relating to every member of the Defence Forces who has taken Lariam since it was first utilised in the Defence Forces.  The amount of resources and time it would take, in circumstances where there is not an indication that substantial numbers have been detrimentally affected by its use, cannot be justified.  I have met some individuals who discussed with me their personal concerns as to the impact of Lariam on them.  I am very conscious of these issues and their situation is not being ignored.  As Minister, I must rely on the advice of the Irish Medicines Board but I will ensure what is necessary is undertaken in regard to any issue concerning the health of members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 19 together.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, mission is the main overseas mission in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed with a total of 356 personnel.  The 106th infantry battalion, comprising some 332 personnel, deployed to UNIFIL in May 2012.  The Irish battalion has been working alongside a contingent of 170 personnel of the Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Irish-Finnish battalion with effect from 1 June 2012.  Both Ireland and Finland previously served together in the Lebanon mission in 2006-2007 and more recently in the UN operation in Chad.</P>
        <P>The joint Irish-Finnish battalion is based in sector west of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations, currently centred on the major towns of Tibnin and Bint Jubayl, and with two posts on the Blue Line, which separates Lebanon and Israel.  The battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts while operating in close co-ordination and co-operation with the Lebanese Armed Forces in sector west of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations.</P>
        <P>At present the security situation in the UNIFIL area of operations in southern Lebanon, including the area in which the Irish-Finnish battalion operates, remains calm but unpredictable.  I welcome participation by the Armed Forces of Finland in this mission with Ireland.  I am confident the joint deployment with Finland will further support interoperability, build experience and deepen further the excellent bilateral relationship between both our countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>Is there a prospective change in regard to the mission?  When a mission starts, it has a concluding date, but coming up to that date one finds it is extended or that additional personnel are required.  Has there been a request from the UN for an expanded or extended mission in this region?  If so, what is the view of the Minister and the Defence Forces in that regard given the large commitment of approximately 330 to the region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>The Defence Forces have a very important role to play in this area.  I visited them and know the work they are doing is greatly appreciated by the local community.  In addition to fulfilling their UN mandate, they engage with the local community and provide assistance where they can on community matters.</P>
        <P>I do not envisage that the UN&rsquo;s commitment to UNIFIL will finish any time soon.  I intend for the Defence Forces to continue to participate in this mission and contribute to maintaining peace in a region that is particularly troubled.  I pay tribute to the work being done by our forces there.  A third contingent has now gone to the region from this State since I was appointed Minister.  The personnel are doing extraordinarily important work.</P>
        <P>My concern, which is shared by many, is that the difficulties in Syria could flow over the border into Lebanon.  There is relative calm in the area but there have been difficulties in the city of Tyre where some fighting has broken out that reflects some of the difficulties in Syria.</P>
        <P>It is important that Ireland continues to play an active role in the United Nations and contributes to peacekeeping in various parts of the world.  It is important that the considerable experience of our Defence Forces in this area is utilised and that they feel their training is put to good use on the international stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
        <P>The Minister touched on my point towards the end of his contribution.  Given the very malignant influence Syria has had on the Lebanon on over the years, has there been any change in the method of appraisal of security over recent months to reflect the insecurity in Syria?  If so, have we at home enhanced our evaluation of the security situation in the Lebanon to reflect that change?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>There is constant reassessment of security issues in the area where our troops are based.  Everyone is very conscious of what is happening across the border in Syria and the crimes against humanity that are being committed there.  There is a great need to bring an end to the barbarity and destruction in Syria, where it appears the Government has turned on its own people in a manner that is completely unacceptable and which may result in some individuals at a future time being brought before the International Criminal Court for the manner in which they have conducted themselves.</P>
        <P>Southern Lebanon remains reasonably calm, as I stated.  Our Defence Forces have a great deal of knowledge of that region.  The general conditions are under constant assessment by the United Nations and our own forces.  I hope the current calm will continue to obtain.</P>
        <P>The House may be interested to know that Brigadier General Patrick Phelan was appointed deputy force commander of UNIFIL on 28 April 2012, for an initial period of one year.  His appointment to the position is in due recognition of the very substantial role we play in the area and the professionalism of our Defence Forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the mission.  I welcome the appointment of Brigadier General Patrick Phelan.  As the Minister stated, it is in recognition of the professionalism and expertise of the Irish Defence Forces in the region and in the UNIFIL missions.</P>
        <P>Does any issue arise regarding the equipment and resources required to complete the mission, especially given what Deputy Calleary stated about a possible change in the circumstances in the region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I am satisfied that we have the required equipment.  While I said to the Deputy that the area is generally calm, circumstances continue to be unpredictable in the context of the security situation in the UNIFIL area of operations in southern Lebanon, including the area in which the Irish-Finnish battalion operates.  The threat level to Defence Forces personnel serving in the Irish battalion area of responsibility is currently assessed by the Defence Forces as substantial.  While there is calm, the assessment is based on occurrences across the border and some of the general difficulties that have arisen in Syria.  Improvised explosive device attacks from militant extremists remain the most significant threat to security in the Irish area of operations and along the blue line separating Lebanon and Israel and its vicinity.  Irish personnel have adjusted their force protection measures accordingly.  In other words, extra care is being taken, to move away from the technical jargon, by comparison with the position 13 or 14 months ago.  The conflict in Syria was starting at that stage but had not escalated to its current level.  There had not been any outbreaks of any description in Lebanon at that time reflecting some of the differences in Syria.  By increasing the threat level, one ensures that all necessary precautionary steps are taken in the interest of the safety of members of the Defence Forces.  Having said that, I do not want to cause undue alarm.  I repeat that, as matters currently stand in the area of operations, there is relative calm.</P>

        <P>Ireland is committed to participation in the Austro-German led Battlegroup, which will be on stand-by from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012. In 2010, the then Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this Battlegroup. The other members of the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Our contribution will be a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters amounting to approximately 175 personnel. Leading up to and during the standby period one officer has been deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany. This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.</P>
        <P>Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures &mdash; &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval. The issue of Battlegroup usability and flexibility has been discussed at the EU Defence Ministers meetings I have attended. Also, within the EU itself, a number of committees, including the Political and Security Committee and the EU Military Committee, keep the issue of Battlegroup response under constant review in consultation with all EU Member States. Any decision to deploy the Austro-German Battlegroup will continue to be taken by unanimity by the Council of the European Union. In addition, Ireland will retain the sovereign right to decide on participation in any crisis management mission involving the Austro-German Battlegroup.    There have not been any discussions to date regarding any particular deployment of the Austro-German EU Battlegroup</P>

        <P>The United Nations Security Council authorized the establishment, for an initial period of 90 days, of a supervision mission, known as the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS). The purpose of the mission is to monitor a cessation of armed violence &ldquo;in all its forms by all parties&rdquo; in Syria. The new mission is also tasked with monitoring the full implementation of the six-point plan proposed by Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the League of Arab States, Mr. Kofi Annan.  On 24th April 2012, the Government approved the deployment of up to six members of the Permanent Defence Force as unarmed military observers to UNSMIS, in response to a request from the United Nations. Six Defence Forces personnel were deployed to the mission area on 11 May 2012. The role of the Irish personnel is to observe and report on the security situation, and any transgressions of the ceasefire agreement and the implementation of the six-point plan.</P>
        <P>However, over the weekend, General Robert Mood, Head of the mission announced that UNSMIS had suspended its activities owing to an intensification of armed violence across the country in the preceding days. Currently, UN observers are not conducting patrols and are staying in their locations until further notice, and engagement with the parties is being restricted. The suspension of the mission is being reviewed on a daily basis by the UN with operations resuming when the situation is fit for the observers to carry out their activities. As with all missions where Defence Forces personnel are deployed, the security situation in Syria will continue to be monitored closely  by the Defence Forces to ensure the security of the Irish personnel deployed to the mission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is ongoing but limited due to resource constraints. The current budgetary provision provides for approximately 30,000 paid training mandays. In 2011 and 2012, I sanctioned paid training mandays to include support for the training of new recruits to the RDF. This was sufficient to train approximately 400 recruits during 2011 and 2012. The military authorities manage recruitment in this context.  The numbers actually enlisted in any one year may not reflect the numbers of recruits trained in that year. In 2011 there were a total of 267 reservists enlisted and up to the end of May 2012 there have been a total of 85 enlistments to the RDF.</P>
        <P>In October 2011 I agreed to sanction limited promotions within the RDF to bring the current strength in all ranks to 70% of the established strength in each rank as provided for in Defence Force regulations CS 4. In the case of promotions from Private to Corporal, the sanction provided that promotions could be made which brought strength to 60% of the established strength as provided for in Defence Force regulations CS 4. I also indicated that any ranks where the strength was at or above 70% (or 60% in the case of Corporal Rank) would not be considered for promotion. In considering the issue of promotions for the RDF I was mindful of the fact that a Value for Money view of the serve is ongoing. Additionally I had to have regard to the Comprehensive view of Expenditure which was underway at the time and which placed a requirement on Government Departments to identify opportunities for savings across all aspects of business. The position agreed by me in October last remains in place.</P>

        <P>On 23 March 2012, the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union decided to activate, for the first time, an EU Operations Centre in Brussels.  The purpose of the Centre is to improve coordination and strengthen civil-military synergies between three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in the Horn of Africa. The EU is currently conducting two military operations in the Horn of Africa.</P>
        <P>1.   Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA, which protects humanitarian aid shipments and fights piracy off the Somali coast and</P>
        <P>2.   EUTM Somalia, which contributes to the training of Somali security forces in Uganda. Ireland plays a leading role in the EUTM Somalia mission contributing ten Defence Forces personnel, including the Mission Commander Colonel Michael Beary.</P>
        <P>The third mission, currently in planning is a civilian mission, which will include expert military support personnel, designed to strengthen maritime capacities in the region (EUCAP NESTOR). These three missions fall within the context of the EU Strategic Framework for the Horn of Africa, adopted on 14 November 2011.</P>
        <P>The EU Operations Centre has six tasks as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />support the Civilian Operations Commander in Brussels for the operational planning and conduct of the upcoming EUCAP NESTOR mission;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />support the EUTM Mission Commander, based in Kampala (Uganda) and enhance strategic coordination between EUTM Somalia and the other CSDP missions in the Horn of Africa.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />liaise with Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA, whose Headquarters is in Northwood, UK;</P>

        <P FLI="0">The EU Operations Centre will not have command responsibility, but will fully respect the existing civil and military chains of command for the various missions.  The Council appointed Navy Captain Ad van der Linde (of the Royal Netherlands Navy) as the first Head of the activated EU Operations Centre. Capt van der Linde has a dedicated staff of some sixteen personnel.  The Operations Centre will be active for an initial period of two years, which may be extended if the Council so decides. Its activities and financing will be regularly reviewed.  There are no financial implications for Ireland from the establishment of the EU Operations Centre.</P>

        <Quest> the progress he has made with the future of closed army barrack sites in Mullingar, Clonmel, Castlebar and Cavan; if any progress has been made on these plans; the consultations that have occurred with the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

        <P>As I have previously outlined to the House the consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years. This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.  As with previous rounds of consolidation under the Defence Forces modernisation programme, barracks once vacated are being disposed of with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the Government decision on barrack closures my Department has written to each Government Department and various agencies and local authorities seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.  As a result I can confirm that agreement has been reached with Mayo County Council for the purchase of Mitchell Barracks Castlebar. The Council has already taken over the property under a caretaker agreement pending full completion of the necessary legal paperwork to complete the transfer of Title.</P>
        <P>There have also been discussions between officials from my Department and a number of other State agencies in relation to the sale of Kickham Barracks Clonmel, and Cavan; however these discussions are still ongoing. Some discussion has also taken place in relation to Mullingar Barracks; however no substantial progress has been made towards achieving a sale.  I can assure you that every effort will be made to dispose of the barracks so as to maximize the benefits to the local community.</P>

        <P>The Military Archives are located in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin 6. The Military Archives are the designated place of deposit for the records of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Army Pensions Board under the terms of the National Archives Act 1986.  Archives are held there and, because of space constraints, in other locations.   The function of the Military Archives is to collect, preserve and make available material relating to the history of the development of the Defence Forces from the formation of the Irish Volunteers in November 1913 up to the present day, inclusive of Defence Forces&rsquo; overseas service with the United Nations from 1958.  The Archives also hold the Bureau of Military History collection.</P>
        <P>The digitisation of records is an ongoing process in the Military Archives. Collections digitised so far include a collection of maps, plans and drawings of various posts and barracks around the country.  The digitisation of the collection known as the Bureau of Military History is currently underway.  Additionally, a Military Service Pensions Archive project is underway to process approximately 300,000 military service pension files covering the Easter 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War.  The purpose of this project is to make the records for this period available to the public and to historians in time for the 100th   anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 2016.  This is a principal project of the Government centenary commemoration programme.</P>
        <P>The requirement for a more suitable home for the Military Archives has been recognised for some time.  The long-term accommodation for the Military Archives is being reviewed in the context of the Government Centenary Programme and the Military Service Pensions Archive project.</P>

        <P>To assist the NPWS in its role in securing the conservation of a representative range of ecosystems and to maintain and enhance populations of flora and fauna in Ireland, the Air Corps provides transport for NPWS personnel in order to facilitate surveys of species that are difficult to view from the ground or at sea, such as waterfowl, seals and deer, as well as surveys of habitats such as cliffs and uplands which are difficult to access.  As part of the national effort to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the EU ban on turf cutting in Special Areas of Conservation, Air Corps aircraft have also been used recently to transport NPWS personnel to monitor these areas.</P>
        <P>These services are provided to the NPWS as the need arises and within the available capability of the Air Corps, having regard to both current and contingent operational commitments. Details of NPWS missions flown by the Air Corps for the past five years are presented in the tabular statement below:</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is devising a national cyber security policy aimed at protecting economic infrastructure, informing and assisting citizens.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regularly briefs the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning on matters relating to this policy and on cyber security issues more generally.  In the first instance, each State agency, business and individual should take every precaution with regard to their security.  Awareness of security, the risks and available safeguards, should be seen as the first line of defence for the security of information systems and networks. </P>
        <P>I am aware of considerable activity in this regard and my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has undertaken a number of awareness campaigns aimed at individuals, SMEs, the education sector, the public sector and business and most recently launched &ldquo;Make IT Secure 2012&rdquo;, the latest campaign in the public awareness initiative on the safe use of the internet.</P>
        <P>As Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I regularly receive briefings on progress regarding the ongoing work in relation to cyber security.  The most recent briefing was at the meeting of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning on Monday last.  Obviously it would be inappropriate to go into any detail on this ongoing work for security reasons but I can inform the Deputy that an Inter-Departmental Cyber Security Committee is being established and the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning will continue to be regularly briefed through the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have also provided assistance in relation to national cyber security response.  In the context of the roles of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, considerable resources are invested in minimising the threats associated with cyber attack and malicious security breaches.  This includes investment in training and comprehensive measures with regard to the security of Defence Forces information and communications systems when deployed, in Ireland and overseas.  Details of measures taken are not publicised again for security reasons.</P>
        <P>Separately, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I can advise that the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive on attacks against Information Systems in September 2010 and the Department of Justice and Equality is closely engaged in the progress of this proposal.</P>

        <P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.  Ireland has participated in the NATO-led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.  Since 2002, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.  Participation in the mission is subject to ongoing review.</P>
        <P>On 21 May 2012, at its summit in Chicago, NATO endorsed an exit strategy that calls for handing control of Afghanistan&rsquo;s security to its own security forces by the middle of 2013 and for the withdrawal of most of the 130,000 foreign troops serving with ISAF by the end of 2014.  It is proposed that the seven Defence Forces personnel will continue to serve with ISAF in the immediate future, subject to ongoing review.  However, as the mission downsizes and ISAF HQ staff are withdrawn, Irish personnel will be withdrawn from the ISAF mission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 130 to 132, inclusive, and 136 together. </P>
        <P>As I have previously outlined to the House the consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.  This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.  As with previous rounds of consolidation under the Defence Forces modernisation programme barracks, once vacated, are being disposed of with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Since 1998 there have been 3 major barrack consolidation programmes.  In July 1998 the then Government announced the closure of 6 barracks (Ballincollig and Fermoy (both Cork), Devoy (Naas), Magee (Kildare), Castleblaney and Clancy (Dublin)).  In the context of the 2009 Budget, the then Government announced the closure of four barracks, (Monaghan, Lifford and Rockhill (Donegal) and Longford).  In November 2011 the Government announced the closure of  four barracks, Castlebar, Clonmel, Cavan and Mullingar.</P>
        <P>To-date eight of these barracks have been disposed of.  These are:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ballincollig,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Fermoy,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Naas,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Clancy,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Castleblaney,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Monaghan,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Longford,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Castlebar.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In relation to the remaining barracks the following is the situation:</P>
        <P>Agreement has also been reached for the sale of Lifford and Rockhill to Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>Discussions are ongoing in relation to the possible sale of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />a portion of Clonmel Barracks,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Cavan Barracks to another State Agency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>The total realised to-date in terms of sales of surplus property is &euro;84m approx.  This, together with income of &euro;18m approx from the sale of other smaller military properties and married quarters has been re-invested in providing equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  There have also been gains in other areas. For example military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks closed on 30th March 2012  have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million per annum.  In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum arising from utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.  This latest phase of consolidation will bring to fourteen the number of military barracks closed since 1998. I can confirm that no further barrack closures are envisaged at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 133 together. </P>
        <P>Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the Government decided to reduce the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) to 9,500 personnel.  In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  The re-organisation will ensure that, within the strength level of 9,500 PDF personnel, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is prioritised.  I have tasked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  Work is ongoing in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am advised that military training techniques are kept up to date.  Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government.  The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations is a major element of Defence Forces collective training.  The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence.  However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, look to whatever efficiencies we can make.  We must take into account the current difficult economic environment.  This will determine the overall financial envelope available for the Department for the acquisition of new military equipment and for upgrading and refurbishment programmes over the coming years.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability to meet all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>A particular focus is in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations.  In this regard, the personal equipment which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including equipment and training resources, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
        <P>The Government continues to be gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation in Syria, marked by escalating violence and mounting casualties with well over 10,000 people estimated to have been killed since the beginning of the crisis 15 months ago.  Following the barbaric murders of hundreds of innocent civilians and small children in Houla and al Qubeir, which I have strongly condemned, fighting and offensive operations have stepped up considerably between the Syrian regime, its affiliated militias and opposition factions across the re country.  The continued shelling of towns and villages by the Syrian armed forces using lethal weapons, artillery and combat helicopters is particularly reprehensible.  The use of force of this kind against defenceless civilians is despicable and testifies further to the regime&rsquo;s complete disregard for human life and for the safety of its own people.</P>
        <P>Those guilty of gross human rights violations such as the atrocities perpetrated in Houla and al Qubeir must be held to account.  Ireland, with its EU partners, was very active in securing the adoption by the UN Human Rights Council on 1 June of a resolution which extended the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry in Syria to investigate the events at Houla and to report on any responsibility that may warrant criminal prosecution.  We have also made clear that we will support any referral of Syria by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>The escalating violence and a sharp increase in attacks on patrols operated by the UN Supervision Mission in Syria &mdash; attacks which have put at risk the Mission&rsquo;s members (including the six serving Irish officers) &mdash; have compelled the Force Commander of this Mission, General Robert Mood, to announce the suspension of its monitoring activities.  Such direct targeting of UN personnel, coupled with obstruction and the prevention of access to specific sites and areas, is completely unacceptable and a blatant violation of the provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions 2042 and 2043 which established UNSMIS.  I call on the Syrian authorities to respect their clear international obligations as host, to ensure the full safety of the observers and to guarantee their freedom of movement.  General Mood has said that the suspension of monitoring activities is being reviewed on a daily basis.  The UN Secretary General will submit proposals to the Security Council and troop contributors in early July on the future of the Mission, once its current mandate expires on 20 July.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant problems it is encountering, the Annan Plan is so far the only platform available to end the violence and to initiate a long-awaited political transition in Syria.  We remain fully committed to this Plan.  All sides must honour their commitments under it and immediately halt all forms of violence.  It is particularly incumbent on the Syrian regime to ensure the complete withdrawal of heavy weaponry and troops from population centres and the release of all political detainees and to ensure free access and movement throughout the country to all, including the media, humanitarian organisations and the UN.</P>
        <P>Equally, the international community needs to consider what further steps should be taken if the Annan plan remains unimplemented and the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate.  Imposing further sanctions is an option which the Security Council will have to consider.  Closer engagement with Russia is also extremely important.  Greater cohesion and unity among the Syrian opposition will also be critical if there is to be any chance of initiating a successful political transition to a new, post-Assad Syria.  In this regard, the next meeting of the Friends of Syria in Paris on the 6th July, which I would hope to attend, will provide an opportunity to consider how to further increase the pressure on the Syrian regime.  That meeting will also be used to urge the opposition parties both within and outside Syria to intensify their cooperation and to agree a common platform.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, and despite the current disheartening situation, the complete cessation of violence and implementation of the Annan Plan still offers the best opportunity to end the conflict and to launch a process of urgently needed political reform and transition in Syria.  Ireland will work steadfastly with its EU partners towards that goal.</P>

        <P>In the extensive public consultation process of the review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, there have been significant inputs and suggestions from a variety of sources emphasising the importance of maternal, neonatal and child health.  As part of this input, there has been explicit reference to the value and contribution of family planning to the health of women and children.</P>
        <P>Ireland through Irish Aid has long been committed to the Millennium Development Goals and MDG5 in particular. MDG5 has two main targets: reducing maternal mortality and achieving universal access to reproductive health, including ante-natal care and family planning services. Ireland has a strong track record of support to family planning services through support to global initiatives and at country level through government health sectors. We also support NGOs doing complementary work to increase access to family planning services.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, Ireland has provided almost &euro;30 million in support of UNFPA&rsquo;s reproductive, maternal and family planning programmes, and through a variety of channels we have assisted access to family planning services in a number of countries where such services are considered inadequate.  Such countries include Mozambique, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Liberia, DRC, Zimbabwe and Somalia.</P>

        <P>The Passports Act, 2008 provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied as to the identity of each applicant for before a passport is issued to him/her. Proofs of identity are required in respect of all passport applications. These requirements, which are outlined both in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form and on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.passport.ie</i>, enhance existing procedures to combat passport and identity fraud. They are also intended to increase public awareness of the importance of a passport in terms of a person&rsquo;s identity and the need to ensure that people take great care in protecting their passports.  The most recent Irish passport issued is generally the only photo-identification required for those renewing a passport. First-time applicants or those, whose passports have been lost or stolen, need to provide photo-identification such as a driver&rsquo;s licence, work ID, student card, social club membership or, where relevant, a passport from another country.</P>
        <P>In those exceptional cases where an applicant is unable provide any general photographic ID, the Passport Service will require that the applicant complete and have witnessed a certificate of identity. The certificate includes preprinted details, including the application photograph, and must be witnessed by one from a list of persons, who are acceptable to the Passport Service for this purpose, and who also personally know the applicant. The certificate of identity will be sent to the applicant upon receipt of the original passport application.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the provisions of Regulation 7(1)(<i>c</i>) of SI 318/1992 as amended by SI 400/2010 where a person presents a vehicle for registration and that vehicle is being registered in their name, a PPS number is requested and recorded at the time the vehicle is registered.  However the majority of vehicles are registered by third parties, i.e. motor dealers, and there could be sensitivities and data protection issues about PPSNs being required in that context.  Regarding the broader question of exchange of information to assist in the detection of fraud, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection already exchange considerable quantities of data. Under the auspices of High Level Group of Revenue and Department of Social Protection officials, consideration is given on an ongoing basis to further exchanges of risk-assessed data, and vehicle purchase data is included in that consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Central Bank has advised me that it has no statutory role in the setting of standard variable interest rates except for a limited role in relation to credit unions.  The standard variable rate that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution&rsquo;s overall funding.   However, the Central Bank has advised me that it does monitor trends across the industry and raises queries with bank boards in the course of its ongoing supervision activities on pricing both in relation to its Consumer Protection and Financial Stability mandates.  Within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank continues to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.  In particular, the Bank advised me that they have written to all lenders and asked them to consider the impact on arrears when considering any future interest rate increases.</P>
        <P>I, as Minister for Finance have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of financial institutions and the Central Bank would not report to me on the specific issues arising in its engagements with lenders on this issue.  However, the Central Bank has informed me it will continue to monitor developments in this area and raise questions where undue concerns arise.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case of a couple who are jointly assessed to tax the rate of tax relief under the travel pass scheme is their marginal rate of tax; (that is, the rate of tax they pay on every extra euro of income earned).  The tax relief under the travel pass scheme is given automatically at source by the employer and does not have to be claimed.  If the couple&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax is 41%, then they get tax relief at that rate.  If their marginal rate of tax is 20%, then they get relief at that rate.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where a couple are jointly assessed to tax, tax is due at the higher rate on income in excess of &euro;41,800 where only one of the couple is earning.  Where the other individual is also earning, the higher rate applies where their joint earnings exceed &euro;65,600.  If a couple are not currently jointly assessed but wish to elect to be so, they should contact their local tax office.</P>

        <Quest> the number of small businesses experiencing VAT problems over the past 12 months; and the procedures in place to advise and assist these companies </Quest>
        <QRef>[30092/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am assuming that the Deputy&rsquo;s Question is focusing on the challenges for businesses in paying the VAT that is due to the Revenue Commissioners arising from their trading activities.  Collection of the taxes and duties payable by individuals and businesses to the Exchequer is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by Revenue that they are not in a position to say precisely how many small businesses have experienced problems in paying their VAT over the last 12 months. Businesses will deal with difficulties in paying creditors, including Revenue, in a number of different ways, including by the use of new or extended credit or overdraft facilities, or the use of invoice discounting arrangements to meet their obligation to Revenue on time. In some instance, late or non-payment may be due to unwillingness to pay as distinct from inability to or difficulty to pay. It is not necessarily the case, therefore, that a payment difficulty will manifest itself in a late payment to Revenue or that every late payment is due to inability to make payment.</P>
        <P>The timeliness of return and payments is measured by Revenue on an ongoing basis and this provides a measure of the potential challenges for business in being timely compliant. I am advised by Revenue that in 2011 for example, 86% of medium sized businesses (those paying tax of between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 annually) had met their VAT return/filing obligations in the month in which the obligation to file the return and make any payment arose.  For the year 2012 to date that percentage has increased to 87%.</P>
        <P>I know that Revenue has a strong focus on maintaining and indeed improving the rates of timely compliance by businesses with their tax return and payment obligations. Notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which businesses are operating at present, it is very important that businesses organise their financial affairs in such a fashion as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. This is essential not just from an Exchequer viewpoint but also because late or non-payment of tax debts puts those businesses who are timely compliant at a significant competitive disadvantage. It is clear that Revenue&rsquo;s focus is bearing dividends as evidenced by the high and improving timely compliance rates reported by Revenue every year.</P>
        <P>As regards advice and assistance to business, Revenue has consistently encouraged businesses experiencing particular tax payment difficulties to work proactively with them at an early stage towards an agreed way through those difficulties so as to quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. In that regard, Revenue has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised Revenue&rsquo;s practical support and assistance to viable businesses.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I provided yesterday to his question on the policy of exchanging Irish pound banknotes and coin for euro since the Irish pound ceased to be legal tender on 9 February 2002. That reply sets out the background to the policy and how the redemption of Irish pound banknotes and coin has been accounted for by the Central Bank.  With regard to the total value of Irish pound banknotes and coin redeemed to date, I am informed by the Central Bank that Irish pound banknotes to the value of &euro;485.4 million and Irish pound coin to the value of &euro;89.4 million was redeemed between 9 February 2002 and 31 May 2012. Of the Irish pound banknotes, notes to the value of &euro;65.4 million were redeemed between the end of 2002 and 31 May 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Bank&rsquo;s policy in relation to interest rates is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  However, EBS has informed me that they have no immediate plans to raise variable interest rates. The last time that EBS raised variable interest rates was August 2011. EBS subsequently reduced its variable rates in December 2011 and again in January 2012. </P>
        <P>In terms of assisting struggling mortgage holders in general, last summer the Government&rsquo;s Economic Management Council established an inter-departmental group to consider further actions that could be deployed to address the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness. This group, which was chaired by Mr. Declan Keane, produced its report at the end of September and it was subsequently published by Government last October. The report recommended a number of additional measures to assist mortgage holders experiencing significant and genuine difficulty with their mortgage repayments such as personal insolvency reform, &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo; initiatives, the provision of an enhanced mortgage advisory function and the development and provision by banks of more flexible and sustainable options to their customers experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Government has accepted the &ldquo;Keane Report&rdquo; recommendations as the most appropriate way to address the problem of significant mortgage arrears. A high level steering group of senior officials, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, is now overseeing the implementation of these measures across Government and, with Central Bank involvement, the   banking sector.  In addition, a temporary Government committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, is now meeting on regular basis on the mortgage arrears issue.</P>
        <P>EBS has also informed me that as part of AIB Group, it has been participating in the Mortgage to Rent scheme, as recommended in the &ldquo;Keane Report&rdquo;. Subject to Central Bank approval, EBS also intends to shortly put live a number of other solutions, aligned with the recommendations in the Keane Report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>The &ldquo;Two Pack&rdquo; regulations being discussed in Europe propose a common budgetary timeline that includes the presentation of a draft budget by 15 October each year.  However, trilogue negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council only commenced recently and it appears that it is extremely unlikely that the regulations will be adopted in time for this year&rsquo;s budgetary cycle.  Given the complexities and procedures involved in our Budget process, we simply could not wait any longer for the regulations to be adopted and have decided to proceed as follows.  My Department is planning to publish an update of the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement in October of this year and, as is the norm, it is intended that Budget 2013 will be presented to the D&aacute;il in early December, though the exact date has yet to be decided. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware, of course, of the arrangements introduced last year under the new EU-semester, whereby the Stability Programme Update, containing revised macroeconomic and budgetary projections, was prepared and submitted to the European Commission last April. This document was also laid before the D&aacute;il and published on the Department of Finance website. The purpose of these new arrangements is to allow for a more intensive period of peer review of other member-states&rsquo; budgetary plans, thereby facilitating a greater degree of budgetary coordination across the EU, and they form part of a wider suite of fiscal governance reforms which are emerging at EU level.</P>
        <P>Finally, I, as the Minister for Finance, and Brendan Howlin, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, along with our respective Departments, will work very closely in the compilation of Budget 2013, as the expenditure estimates are obviously a key factor in devising budgetary policy and calculating the overall budgetary arithmetic.</P>

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 43 together. </P>
        <P>I am advised by NAMA that it did not pay any consideration to participating institutions for personal guarantees attached to acquired loans. This is because it did not consider that such guarantees had any residual value in the vast majority of cases as the amounts potentially recoverable were limited to the value of secured assets. The policy of the NAMA Board from the outset has been to pursue all personal guarantees to the greatest extent feasible where there is value to be obtained. I am advised by NAMA that, with respect to co-operative debtors who have made full disclosure of assets and liabilities, it may, on a case-by-case basis, consider the release of personal guarantees or personal recourse two years after the value of all assets have been realised. I am also advised that the NAMA Board has recently decided that it will review this issue again in the light of any revised personal insolvency regime that may be introduced following enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 215 of 12 June 2012, wherein he stated that the said National Asset Management Agency&rsquo;s provisional impairment charge of &euro;810,000,000 was based on estimated future cash flows on individual loans including cash flow from the future disposal of assets, if he will set out the basis on which NAMA calculates the value of the future disposal of assets and in particular if NAMA makes any assumptions on the recovery of property values. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
        <P>I am informed by NAMA that its 2011 impairment assessment is based on a combination of a detailed cash flow forecasting exercise for all borrower connections which are considered individually significant (corresponding to debtors managed directly by NAMA) and a collective assessment for the rest of the loan portfolio.  For all individually significant debtors, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, an assessment is made in respect of all future cash flows expected from each individual debtor.  This assessment represents a best estimate of the future cash flows reflecting the performance of the individual debtor and other known developments which could impact future cash flows including local economic conditions, the trading performance of the debtor and the value of the property collateral. </P>
        <P>In assessing the cash flows for individual debtors, NAMA does not make general assumptions in respect of the recovery of property values. The value of the property collateral that will be recovered by NAMA is assessed individually by debtor and by asset. The value of the property collateral takes into consideration the November 2009 valuation carried out by an independent valuer as part of NAMA&rsquo;s due diligence process as well as subsequent developments in respect of the property which may have an impact on the value that expects to recover. To the extent that expected disposal proceeds are less than those indicated by the November 2009 valuation, the resultant shortfall is reflected within the overall impairment charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>Firstly I wish to advise the Deputy that this Government has maintained funding for resources for children with special educational needs at a time when there is a continued requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. There is no overall reduction in Resource Teaching or Special Needs Assistant (SNA) numbers for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Resource Teaching and SNA support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  Specifically in relation to Resource Teaching allocations, I wish to clarify that the number of posts available to the NCSE for allocation is 5,500 which is the same as last year.  This is on top of 4,450 resource and learning support teachers provided to all schools to support children with less complex, or high incidence, learning needs.</P>
        <P>In the context of the 5,500 WTE Resource Teaching posts available to the NCSE for allocation for the coming school year, the number of valid applications received for the 2012/2013 school year to date has risen marginally with rising enrolments in schools. It is necessary therefore to manage these resources so that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same.  In order to ensure there are sufficient remaining posts to make allocations for late or emergency applications, while staying within the Employment Control Framework (ECF), the NCSE will initially allocate 85% of assessed needs to schools.  Schools are being asked to make up any time lost through grouping of students and more effective management of teaching time, to ensure that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same.</P>
        <P>As a result of the allocations announced on June 13th by the NCSE, 55% of schools will see no change in SNA allocation for the 2012/13 school year.  23% of schools will see some reductions in SNA allocations, while 22% of schools will see some increases in their allocations.  This clearly illustrates that SNA allocations are adjusted each year, to ensure that the children who need SNA support to assist with their care needs, are provided with that support.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources available to my Department are utilised to optimum benefit to ensure the best possible outcomes for students with special educational needs. In this regard my Department is seeking advice from the NCSE on policy options for the allocation of these resources in future, with a view to ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient model is in place in the coming years.</P>

The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE has confirmed that the SNA allocation for the school in question for the 2012/13 school year is a sufficient level of support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children in the context of the applications received for the 2012/13 school year.</P>
        <P>The SNA allocation to the school for 2011/2012 was reviewed by the NCSE which found that the school had a surplus of 4 SNA posts. Having considered the allocation for the coming school year the NCSE has allocated SNA support to meet the requirements of all qualifying children. The 4 surplus SNA posts identified in the review  remain surplus to requirements as determined in accordance with the Departments criteria for the allocation of SNA posts and will be removed so that they can be allocated elsewhere where they are needed. It is worth noting that this school has been allocated 12 SNA posts for the forthcoming school year, which is an extensive provision of resources by any measure.</P>
        <P>Following the allocation of SNA posts for the coming school year the NCSE will have some 264 posts available for allocation throughout the school year in respect of late or emergency cases arising or new diagnosis. Based on previous experience it is expected that this number of posts will be sufficient to meet any late or emergency demand arising. It is expected that schools seeking to have their SNA provision reviewed, before requesting any review of their SNA provision, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.  It is open to schools to contact their local SENO in this regard, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www..ncse.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>The assessment of means under my Department&rsquo;s student grant scheme is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions.  The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.  The eligibility of an applicant, or the level of the grant awarded, may be re-assessed by the awarding authority in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Anti-Bullying Forum, which was held on Thursday, 17th May, brought together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector including parents and students.  I was very pleased to open this important Forum and to provide an opportunity to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate. The range of speakers on the day of the Forum included contributions from my Department, Professor Mona O&rsquo;Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre, Trinity College, representatives of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition (NABC), and contributors from the school sector from the various perspectives of school principal, parent and pupil. The Forum also gave other stakeholders an opportunity to give their views.</P>
        <P>The proceedings of the Forum were broadcast live over the internet and recordings of the day&rsquo;s events can be now viewed by accessing the Anti-Bullying Forum webpage of my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www..education.ie</i>. The presentations of the various speakers can also be viewed and downloaded from this page.  As a follow on to holding the Forum itself, I have invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties, including those unable to attend the event on the day, to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012. Full details of how this can be done are available on the Anti-Bullying Forum webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.education.ie</i>.  I have also established a working group on tackling bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.</P>
        <P>The outcomes from the Forum together with the submissions from the stakeholders and other interested parties will assist the working group in its deliberations. This working group includes representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and will draw upon the expertise of a range of organisations throughout their work. As part of this process the working group will also consider practices and experiences of other jurisdictions in the area of bullying, in order that these can inform and assist the working group in its work.</P>

        <P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
        <P>In relation to age, the position is that a child must be at least 4 years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a primary school. Subject to this requirement, individual schools may apply a selection criterion that prioritises children on the basis of their age e.g. to give priority to older children or to give priority to children who have reached the age of four by a date specified by the school.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based is matter for the individual school authority. In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.  As the Deputy will be aware, last June, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document, &ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</P>
        <P>Education partners and interested parties were invited to submit their views and the Department is currently co-ordinating their submissions. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.  I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that every child has a place at school.</P>

        <Quest> if he will outline the consequences for schools and pupils needing additional help due to the reduction in the allocations for resource teachers and special needs assistants for 2012/2013; if he has considered the concerns outlined by representative groups in the education sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30224/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
        <P>Firstly I wish to clarify for the Deputy that there is no overall reduction in Resource Teaching or Special Needs Assistant (SNA) numbers for the coming school year.  This Government has maintained funding for resources for children with special educational needs at a time when there is a continued requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Resource Teaching and SNA support, to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</P>
        <P>There are 10,575 SNA posts available for allocation in the 2012/13 school year which is the same number of posts which were available for allocation for the current school year. The NCSE is currently notifying schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  It is expected that the demand for SNA support in the coming school year can be met within current numbers and that all children who meet the criteria for SNA support will have access to support. The NCSE will have some 264 available posts for allocation throughout the school year in respect of late or emergency cases arising or new diagnoses.</P>
        <P>There are 5,500 WTE Resource Teaching posts available to the NCSE for allocation for the coming school year, which is the same as last year. This does not include the 4,450 resource and learning support teachers being provided to all schools to support children with less complex, or high incidence, learning needs.  With rising enrolments in schools, the number of valid applications received by the NCSE for the 2012/2013 school year to date is higher than last year.  It is necessary therefore to manage these resources so that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same.  Therefore, in order to ensure there are sufficient remaining posts to make allocations for late or emergency applications, while staying within the Employment Control Framework (ECF), the NCSE will initially allocate 85% of assessed needs to schools.  Schools are being asked to make up any time lost through grouping of students and more effective management of teaching time, to ensure that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same.</P>
        <P>As a result of the allocations announced on June 13th by the NCSE, 55% of schools will see no change in SNA allocation for the 2012/13 school year.  23% of schools will see some reductions in SNA allocations, while 22% of schools will see some increases in their allocations.  This clearly illustrates that SNA allocations are adjusted each year, to ensure that the children who need SNA support to assist with their care needs, are provided with that support.  My Department has met the representative groups in the education sector to outline the arrangements for allocating Resource Teaching SNA support to schools for the 2012/2013 school year.</P>
        <P>Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources available to my Department are utilised to optimum benefit to ensure the best possible outcomes for students with special educational needs. In this regard my Department is seeking advice from the NCSE on policy options for the allocation of these resources in future, with a view to ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient model is in place in the coming years.</P>

        <P>As outlined in the Five Year Plan, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years. Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet future demographic demands, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently. The Deputy will appreciate that the primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan, is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet this demographic demand, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a project for the school in question will be progressed.</P>

        <P>This is a day-to-day operational matter for F&Aacute;S.  I am informed by F&Aacute;S that in order to become an apprentice applicants must be at least 16 years of age and have attained a minimum of grade D in 5 subjects in the Junior Certificate or equivalent. Where individuals do not meet the minimum educational requirements they may be registered as apprentices by an employer if prospective apprentices have satisfactorily completed an approved preparatory training course and an assessment interview; or being over 18 years of age, have at least 3 years relevant work experience and satisfactorily completed an assessment interview; and where required the prospective apprentice has passed an appropriate colour vision test.  Prospective apprentices can obtain information on entry requirements and trades by accessing the adult career guidance service provided through the NEES Employment Services network or the F&Aacute;S Services to Business offices located nationwide.</P>
        <P>However, to register as an apprentice the prospective apprentice must first obtain employment in their chosen occupation.  Under the statutory rules of apprenticeship all employers are required to register their apprentices with F&Aacute;S within two weeks of commencing employment.   Furthermore, any employer wishing to register an apprentice must be able to satisfy F&Aacute;S that the employer is capable of providing access to the range of work specified in the curriculum for that trade, as well as the necessary tools and equipment. The employer must be able to provide a suitably qualified and experienced craftsperson to oversee the training and work of the apprentice as well as a suitable person approved by F&Aacute;S to carry out the specified assessments required to establish an apprentice&rsquo;s competence.</P>
        <P>According to F&Aacute;S records the individual in question registered with his local NEES Employment Office on 19 January 2012 at which point he would have received a guidance interview.  Since his NEES registration he has been met on two further occasions and received update guidance interviews, on 28th February and 25th May 2012.  I understand that the F&Aacute;S/NEES &mdash; Client Services System records currently indicate that the individual in question has not declared his interest in becoming an apprentice. He should contact his local NEES Employment Office to update his records accordingly.</P>

        <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 implemented EU Council Directive 97/81/EC into Irish law.  The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC.  The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.</P>
        <P>Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement (which is not a mandatory provision) provides that, as far as possible, employers should give consideration to: &ldquo;(a) requests by workers to transfer from full-time to part-time work that becomes available in the establishment; (b) requests by workers to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise; (c) the provision of timely information on the availability of part-time and full-time positions in the establishment in order to facilitate transfers from full-time to part-time or vice versa; (d) measures to facilitate access to part-time work at all levels of the enterprise, including skilled and managerial positions, and where appropriate, to facilitate access by part-time workers to vocational training to enhance career opportunities and occupational mobility; (e) the provision of appropriate information to existing bodies representing workers about part-time working in the enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Section 13(5) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 contained provisions in relation the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Clause 5.3 of Council Directive 97/81/EC has been correctly transposed by way of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.  I note that this is confirmed by a 2003 report on the implementation of the Directive undertaken by the European Commission.  As mentioned above, Clause 5.3 of the Directive is not a mandatory provision.  It requires that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time in certain circumstances and vice-versa.</P>
        <P>The Code of Practice contains provisions both in relation to transferring from full-time work to part-time work and from part-time work to full-time work.  For example, in paragraph 4 of the Code, under the &ldquo;General Principles&rdquo; heading, one of the basic principles referred to is that, as far as possible, employers should give consideration to requests by employees to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise.  In addition, the heading in paragraph 8 of the Code also includes a reference to the transfer from part-time to full-time work.  Ireland has, accordingly, met its responsibilities in relation to transposition of this clause of the Framework Agreement by way of a Code of Practice implemented under Section 13 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</P>

        <P>The Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 actions to be implemented by all 15 Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies, and is intended to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.  The Plan aims to deliver the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, and increase the number of people at work in Ireland by 100,000 &mdash; from 1.8m to 1.9m &mdash; by 2016.</P>
        <P>The Plan includes a number of measures to improve supports for SMEs including the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Access to credit through the introduction of the Temporary Partial Guarantee Scheme, which will make it easier for viable small and medium businesses to access finance.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Closely monitoring the lending targets for the pillar banks and ensuring that these targets are met.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Helping SMEs to improve the quality of their loan applications.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved tax incentives have been introduced for small business such as the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Incentive Scheme and Revenue Job Assist which provide for significant cost savings for employers who take on extra staff and an improvement in the Seed Capital Scheme for new start-ups.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />We are actively working to facilitate more SMEs to compete for public procurement opportunities.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There is an increased emphasis on mentoring of SMEs and funding has been provided to support a new Management Development Networks programme.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Other supports which help companies to reduce their costs through greater energy efficiency are available from Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland has established a new Potential Exporters Division to deliver a wide range of initiatives, focussed on helping companies to export to international markets.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />To assist the cash flow of businesses, Government Departments and State Agencies (excluding commercial semi-state bodies) are obliged to pay their suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. Any businesses experiencing difficulties in securing such payments should, in the first instance, approach the Government Department or State body concerned.  Any failures to comply with the initiative can also be brought to the attention of the relevant Minister with responsibility for the body concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A new website &mdash; <i>businessregulation.ie</i> &mdash; has been launched and is aimed at reducing the burden of red tape on business by bringing together in one place clear information on regulations imposed by over 30 Government bodies and how to comply with them. The website was developed to address a clear need identified by business for a single source of information on regulatory requirements.  The Government will report on the delivery of these measures in its quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan for Jobs.</P>

        <P>I have not directly received a proposal from Dunhill Rural Enterprises Ltd., but I understand that the organisation has developed a model for the creation of jobs in small local communities through the establishment of networks of micro-enterprises.  Given the scale of our unemployment problem, I believe that all sectors of society have a role to play in addressing job creation in the economy &mdash; Government, the business sector and the community sector.  This is recognised in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a series of actions to support local initiatives undertaken by enterprises and by communities. </P>
        <P>The Action Plan includes a commitment to conduct a report on the potential of social enterprises to create jobs.  The report will identify the actions required by Government and other relevant bodies and agencies to support the creation of jobs in the sector.  It will examine potential initiatives in the area, and will set out recommendations for the sector.  Forfas is carrying out this work on my behalf.  The project scoping work and initial research has involved discussions with a number of relevant parties, including Dunhill Rural Enterprises Ltd.  I have asked Forfas to complete their work and to report to me by the end of the year.</P>

        <P>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 was published on 22 December 2011.  The Bill completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 19 January 2012 and Committee Stage on Tuesday last, June 19th.  It is expected that the legislation will complete its passage through the Oireachtas before the Summer recess.  When enacted, this Bill will implement the programme of reforms to the JLC/REA systems agreed by Government in July 2011. It will radically overhaul the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</P>

        <P>My officials advise me that this Work Permit application was refused on the 15th   December 2011 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />positions requiring specialist or scarce skills, expertise or qualifications which cannot be filled elsewise; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />where an employer does not have more than 50% of its workforce drawn from non EEA nationals</P>
        <P FLI="0">Furthermore permits are issued in respect of employment where it is established that a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 per annum is on offer, based on a 39 hour week.</P>
        <P>It appeared that insufficient efforts were made to recruit/train an Irish or EEA National for this position. New work permit applications can only be considered where it is established that the position has been advertised with F&Aacute;S/EURES for a period of 8 weeks and that this advertisement has been flagged as a work permit vacancy and advertised for at least six days in both local and national newspapers.</P>
        <P>Finally, it also appeared from the information provided that this employee was already working for the company without having a valid employment permit and that the company had no other employees.  The applicant was notified of this decision in writing and of their right to appeal this decision within 21 days. As no appeal was received in the Employment Permits Section this matter is now at an end. If however the applicant wishes to make a new application in this instance the matter will be given further consideration.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who has policy responsibility for the Illness Benefit scheme, held a consultative meeting to discuss potential changes to the scheme in Ireland.  Representatives from my Department and Forf&aacute;s attended this forum, along with a number of business representative organisations.  A Staff Report on Ireland&rsquo;s economic developments and policies was published by the International Monetary Fund on 15th June.  The report encourages the reforming of sick leave policies in Ireland by requiring employers to pay for the first two to four weeks of illness.  The views expressed in the paper are those of the IMF staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Executive Board of the IMF. In fact, the report is inaccurate in commenting that the State pays sick pay from the outset of an illness when, in practice, no payment is made for the first three days of illness.</P>
        <P>The cost to the State of sickness payments in the social welfare system is currently estimated to be approximately &euro;900 million per annum.  This includes payments to those with sick pay entitlements in both the private and public sector.  Improved management of absenteeism across all sectors would obviously be welcome in terms of cost savings and increased productivity.</P>
        <P>Employers&rsquo; groups have publicly outlined their views on proposed changes to the sick pay scheme and have expressed concerns about the potential impact on enterprises.  They have pointed out that there is already a high commitment to managing absenteeism at enterprise level.  The Government will examine any proposals which the Minister for Social Protection may submit to it for consideration, and will have regard to the overall impact of the measures proposed.</P>

Budgets for 2012 will be finalised as soon as the financial review of CE Schemes is completed which is expected in the near future.  Officials from the Department will be in touch with CE sponsor organisations once the review is completed.  There are no plans locally to change either the number of schemes or the number of participants per scheme. All projects are funded on a year by year basis and will continue to operate subject to the rules of CE.  The Deputy should note that supervisors are full-time employees of the sponsoring organisation and can be contacted through their employer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P>The Community Employment (CE) Scheme is a key element of social provision in Ireland and its value and contribution is recognised by all stakeholders and beneficiaries.  In addition to its labour market activation role, CE provides two key socioeconomic benefits.  Firstly, it provides a valuable role for CE workers in their own communities, many of whom would otherwise be marginalised and economically inactive.  Secondly, it helps to sustain community organisations and to provide valuable social services in disadvantaged areas.  There are also key benefits to the CE participants themselves in terms of personal development, self-esteem, accredited training and valuable work experience.  The intrinsic value of CE lies in the economic contribution it makes towards the provision of services, many of which would fall back on the State to provide at much higher cost.</P>

        <P>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned in September 2011.  This application was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for the allowance.  A letter issued on the 15th November 2011 advising the person concerned of the decision.  She subsequently requested a review of this decision and supplied additional information on her child&rsquo;s condition.  Her application along with the extra information she provided, was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who found the child to be medically eligible for the allowance.  The person concerned was notified of the decision on the 13th June 2012 and payment will issue shortly.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned took place on 28th   May 2012 and the Appeals Officer is now considering the appeal in the light of all the evidence submitted, including that adduced at the hearing.

        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week and processes in excess of 2 million claims each year.  However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement that is due to them.  The Deputy may be aware of the Department&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit (SIU) is specifically tasked with investigating fraud and abuse of social welfare schemes.  Its work involves a broad range of management, liaison, enforcement, investigation and intelligence gathering duties and it operates at the high or more organised end of social welfare fraud and abuse.  Individuals whose lifestyle and display of wealth or assets are not commensurate with social welfare dependency are targeted for investigation.  Where intelligence or reliable reports are received about persons engaged in concurrent working and claiming or under declaration of income, reviews of eligibility are immediately undertaken.  The Unit works closely with Revenue staff in the Joint Investigation Unit, with the Garda&iacute; and other compliance and enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>The Department accepts reports of possible fraud from members of the public in relation to the various schemes it administers.  To this end, it operates both a dedicated phone number and there is also a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website to make such reports. Members of the public are asked to provide as much detail about the case they are reporting as possible and they can do so anonymously.</P>

        <P>While some national authorities have implemented some form of entry level licence, these licences have not achieved full international recognition as of yet.  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s radio amateur representative body, the Irish Radio Transmitter Society, has advised ComReg that a foundation licence or similar is not something of interest to the radio amateur community.  I understand that while the matter will be continually reviewed by ComReg in light of international practices, there is no immediate plan to reduce the qualifications to facilitate a foundation type of licence.</P>

        <P>I refer to the replies to Question numbers 864 of 18 April 2012 and 273 of 8 May 2012, and Sligo County Council&rsquo;s decision to engage an independent financial consultant to prepare a report on the financial position of the Council. The report is intended to inform and advise the Council members and management on possible ways forward in dealing with the challenging financial circumstances of the Council.  I have already confirmed that my Department was consulted on the terms of reference for the review and I have asked to be provided with a copy of the report when it is complete. I understand that the report is to be submitted to the Council early in July.</P>

        <P>The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the Semi State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord G&aacute;is Group.  While I understand that Bord G&aacute;is Eireann does come under Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiula, specific legislation will be brought before the House to establish Irish Water which will set out more detailed provisions regarding the establishment and operation of Irish Water, including whether it will come under Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Housing Act, 1966, the provision and management of dwellings, including the carrying out of planned maintenance programmes and pre-letting repairs, is the responsibility of the relevant housing authority. Housing maintenance works, including pre-letting repairs, are funded directly by local authorities from their own resources, including from rental income and receipts from the disposal of properties and sales of houses to tenants.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock, including the regeneration of large social housing estates and flat complexes, estate wide remedial works schemes, a retrofitting measure to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses and funding for extensions and adaptations to meet the needs of tenants with a disability etc. Given the constraints on capital budgets for new stock, my Department has in recent years placed a greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement works programmes and on the early return of vacant units to productive use.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;18 million is being provided this year for improving the quality and energy efficiency of older housing stock. Beginning in 2011, my Department required local authorities to focus the energy retrofitting programme on bringing vacant stock back into productive use. The 2012 programme will build on the achievements of 2011 when more than 2,600 vacant units were refurbished and made available for re-letting. While local authorities may undertake work on tenanted properties, there is a continuing focus on making vacant properties available for re-letting as quickly as possible. Grants of up to &euro;15,000 per house are generally available for improving the fabric of the house with a further grant of up to &euro;3,000 where additional essential works are needed. Over the course of 2010 and 2011 a total of 4,492 houses were improved.</P>
        <P>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, provides a range of grant supports to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings, reduce emissions and improve comfort levels. However, these measures do not apply to tenants of local authority houses and any proposal to extend the benefits of these schemes to local authority tenants is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister concerned.</P>
        <P>I intend to review the operation of the Social Housing Improvement Works Programme, including the energy efficiency measure, with a view to possible changes aimed at improving the targeting and overall effectiveness of the various measures. This review will include issues like co-ordinating the carrying out of pre-letting repairs and installation of attic and wall insulation in older properties.</P>

        <Quest> when it is expected that measures will be introduced to alleviate the unfair burden on shared ownership mortgage holders who are finding it impossible to meet the requirements of the scheme particularly when their rent repayments exceed loan repayments for, in some situations, a much lower part of the equity; if he will examine the matter as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the Shared Ownership scheme the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.</P>
        <P>Local authority mortgage holders and including those who purchased under shared ownership &mdash; also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which generally run at around 0.5% lower than the best rates available in the market and currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service. The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the total number of Special Exemption Order applications dealt with by the District Court in 2011 was 53,837.  The income from court fees in respect of these applications was &euro;16,151,100.  Excise duty of &euro;110 per application is also payable to Revenue.  The Service has indicated to me that statistics are not maintained on the number of such orders granted by the Court and that the data could not be extracted without a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and resources which could not be justified in the circumstances.</P>

        <P>Enquiries with members of the Garda National Immigration Bureau and officials of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, who carry out immigration control at Dublin Airport, did not identify any incident similar to that described by the Deputy.  However, if details regarding the flight on which the persons concerned travelled to Dublin airport can be provided, it would greatly assist in identifying the immigration control point at Dublin airport at which the persons presented in order to seek permission to enter the State. This would, of course, assist with any further enquiries.  As a general principle, the Deputy will be aware that it is open to a member of the public directly affected by the conduct of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that he or she believes is misbehaviour to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission as the body responsible for receiving and dealing with all complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A witness to such behaviour may also make a complaint.</P>

        <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 353 of 7 February, 2012, which was as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">The reform of personal insolvency law, the Heads of Bill which I have published, will involve the introduction of three new non-judicial debt settlement systems, subject to relevant conditions in each case. These are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="2">A Debt Relief Certificate to allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &euro;20,000, after a one-year moratorium period for debtors with &ldquo;no assets &mdash; no income&rdquo;;</P>
        <P LI="2">A Debt Settlement Arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt of &euro;20,001 and over with two or more creditors;</P>
        <P LI="2">A Personal Insolvency Arrangement for the agreed settlement of both secured and unsecured debt of &euro;20,001 to &euro;3 million with one or more creditors.  The Personal Insolvency Bill will also continue the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and will include, critically, the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after 3 years in place of the current 12 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am of the view that new personal insolvency laws, including the bankruptcy law reform, should provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to manage or settle debt with their customers. Such agreements should in time become the norm as the most sensible and cost-effective arrangements, particularly where the issue is one of dealing with repayment difficulties for a single major debt, secured or otherwise. These agreements could include measures to address mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Personal Insolvency Bill is currently being drafted by my Department in cooperation with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel. I can assure the Deputy that the Bill remains a legislative priority for the Government and the revised time frame for publication of the Bill is now the end of June with the strong intention to commence Second stage in the D&aacute;il prior to the Summer recess to facilitate early passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas in the Autumn session.</P>

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 March, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. In advance of a final decision being made, the case of the person concerned will be examined to determine what, if any, impact the European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case may have on her case.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The legal representative of the person concerned submitted an Irish passport on behalf of the child of the person concerned and was informed by letter from my Department dated 26 October 2011 that because her child held an Irish Passport, the provisions of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) do not apply in the child&rsquo;s case.

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, arising from the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) was reduced to 9,500 personnel. In response to this reduced strength ceiling, I initiated a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve. As a three Brigade structure is no longer viable at this strength level, the re-organisation will encompass a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from the current three to two.</P>
        <P>There has been a concerted campaign of misinformation about the possible impacts of this reorganisation on Custume Barracks, Athlone. In particular this campaign has claimed that a withdrawal of the Brigade headquarters would result in a reduction in the strength level in Custume Barracks by 600 personnel. In order to clarify the position and refute this misinformation, I recently announced where the headquarters of the two new Brigades would be located, which is Cork and Dublin and what this means for Custume Barracks.</P>
        <P>I can confirm again that within an overall strength of 9,500, the numbers serving in Custume Barracks will be of the order of 1,000 personnel. There are presently 1,050 personnel in Custume Barracks. Accordingly, the re-organisation will have no dramatic impact on numbers in Custume Barracks. I can also confirm again that under the re-organisation Custume Barracks will not close and that it will continue to be an important operational military barracks.  I trust that this clarifies the position and disproves the campaign of misinformation, which has caused undue concerns for the citizens of Athlone and its environs.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In October 2011 I agreed to sanction limited promotions within the Reserve Defence Force to bring the current strength in all ranks to 70% of the established strength in each rank as provided for in Defence Force Regulations CS 4 (ranks where the strength was at or above 70% would not be considered for promotion). Since my decision of October 2011 no RDF Officers have been promoted, however the military authorities have advised me that arrangements for competitive RDF Officer Promotions are currently being put in place and interviews will commence shortly to fill selected vacancies in the RDF up to the authorised level of 70% of the permitted RDF Officer strength.</P>

        <P>A Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force commenced in February 2010. In accordance with the appropriate guidelines, a Steering Committee was established to oversee the Review. This Steering Committee is comprised of representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. A Working Group undertakes detailed analysis and prepares preliminary drafts for consideration by the Steering Committee.  Since the commencement of the VFM Review there have been a total of ten Steering Committee meetings. On average, the duration of these meetings is of the order of approximately two hours. In addition, the Steering Committee have visited a Reserve summer camp in the Curragh and met with the Representative Associations. Certain members of the Steering Committee have also met with senior Reserve Officers. The membership of the Steering Committee (with replacements in brackets) is as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">Ms Mary Butler, Independent Chairperson <i>(Until 22 February, 2012).</i></P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. Robert Mooney, Principal Officer, Department of Defence.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ms Butler was unable to continue as Chairman and it is anticipated that a new independent Chairperson will be appointed to the Steering Committee in the near future. In the interim period Mr. Robert Mooney, Department of Defence, is acting as Chairman.</P>
        <P>The Steering Committee has met on 3 (three) occasions to-date in 2012, i.e. on the 22nd February, on the 3rd May and most recently, on the 6th June last.

        <P>The ferry service operating between Cobh and the Naval Base provides transport between Cobh and the Naval Base for Naval Service personnel and civilian staff.  The service, which has been in existence for over 50 years, currently operates on the basis of both a scheduled time-tabled service and an on call 24 hours a day service.  The service, which is a valuable asset, provides the Naval Service with significant flexibility and capability in the harbour region and is required for Naval operational reasons.  Labour costs make up the majority of the operating costs of the service.  The costs for 2011 comprised direct labour costs of &euro;910,833 and maintenance costs of &euro;63,781.  There is no revenue generated by the service.  The question of reducing the operational costs in relation to the provision of this service is under consideration. </P>

I have asked the Chief of Staff and Secretary General to bring forward detailed re-organisation proposals for my consideration. Work is  ongoing in this regard. The effect of the changes on promotion cannot be determined until the proposals are considered and decisions made.

        <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 to 139, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The following tables set out the number of women by rank serving in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps at 31 December for each of the years 2007 to 2011, and at 31 May 2012, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.In 2007, the Department received the report of a TNS/MRBI study it had commissioned, titled &ldquo;Retention and Recruitment of Women in the Defence Forces&rdquo;. This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action could be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining. The question of retention was also studied.</P>
        <P>The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving women agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work. In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70%-80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer.  The recommendations of the report have been implemented and the challenges identified therein continue to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces, on the direction of the Chief of Staff, has established a Working Group to examine levels of participation by women in the organisation. The Working Group will, <i>inter alia</i>, inquire into why women apply or do not apply for positions within the Defence Forces and what can be done to increase awareness among women of a career in the Defence Forces. The data gathered from the review will be used to formulate new policies in this area, specifically aimed at increasing participation by women in the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment. Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks. The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which he has had discussions and EU and UN level with regard to future deployment of the Defence Forces overseas; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30240/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
        <P>During each EU Presidency both formal and informal meetings of Defence Ministers are held.  Last November I attended the formal meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Defence Ministers.  The Operation Commanders of the three current EU-led missions were also in attendance. Discussions were focused on these current operations and future proposed developments.</P>
        <P>Ireland contributes Defence Forces personnel to two of the three current EU military missions.  Ireland contributes seven personnel to the Operation ALTHEA mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Ireland also contributes ten personnel, including Mission Commander Colonel Michael Beary, to EUTM Somalia, the EU&rsquo;s mission to train Somali security forces in Uganda.  The other EU military mission, Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA, is the EU&rsquo;s first maritime operation which contributes to improving maritime security off the coast of Somalia and in the Indian Ocean.  Ireland does not currently contribute personnel to this operation.  Ireland has received an invitation from the Operational Commander of Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA to contribute an Autonomous Vessel Protection Detachment (AVPD) to the Operation. The Department is considering whether it will be in a position to contribute an AVPD to this operation.</P>
        <P>The EU is also planning a Regional Maritime Capacity Building mission to enhance the capacity of Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa region to fight piracy.  The proposed mission will be complementary to and have close coordination with Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA and EUTM Somalia and international actors.  This will be a civilian mission augmented with military expertise.</P>
        <P>Ireland will participate in the Austro-German led Battlegroup which will be on standby from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012.  The other members of the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).  Training and planning is currently ongoing in preparation for a Battlegroup deployment if such a decision is taken by the Council.</P>
        <P>Regarding UN missions, Ireland currently contributes 356 personnel to the UNIFIL Mission.  Following the deployment of a contingent of some 170 personnel of the Armed forces of Finland to UNIFIL, a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion was formed in May 2012.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with several United Nations missions.  Six Defence Forces personnel are currently serving as military observers with the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS).  Overall there are currently 440 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.</P>
        <P>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  However, following the deployment to UNIFIL, it is not anticipated that there will be any major deployments of troops to further missions in the foreseeable future.  Within the EU itself, a number of committees, including the Political and Security Committee and the EU Military Committee, keep the issues of troop deployments, including rapid response, under constant review in consultation with all EU Member States.</P>

        <P>I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including equipment and training resources, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence. However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in.  The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government including the provision of assistance in any emergency situations that may arise.</P>

        <P>I regret that a reply was not issued to the representations made.  The position is as follows.</P>
        <P>Additional conservation measures were introduced for the first time in 2009 to protect depleted stocks of cod, whiting and haddock in ICES Area VIa (off the north west coasts of Donegal and Scotland). These restrictions involved the use of larger mesh size, escape panels in nets and a ban on certain types of fishing gear. These restrictions were continued under EU Regulation 1288/2009 with some modification to allow for a fishery by means of mechanised jigging for mackerel and black pollock for the period up to the end of June 2011. Council Regulation 579/2011 provided for a further extension of these measures for the period up to the 31 December 2012. The restrictions on haddock were removed following the adoption by the EU Commission of emergency measures (Commission Regulation 161/2012) in February 2012.</P>
        <P>I am very well aware that the measures in place, which precludes fisheries for lesser spotted dogfish and mechanised jigging for White Pollock (saithe), have been a matter of concern for fishermen which had traditionally fished these species in these waters.  In October 2011, the Department submitted a request for a number of changes to the EU Regulation, including changes that would permit a fishery for spurdog and White Pollock and supported the case with the BIM studies involving pilot work on the impact of these local fisheries on stocks subject to additional conservation measures (cod, whiting and spiny dogfish) and requested that the case be evaluated by Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee (STECF).  STECF report of April 2012 is fully supportive of the inclusion of an amendment to allow for a mechanised jigging fishery for White Pollock. In relation to the fishery for lesser spotted dogfish, it recommends that if the proposal from Ireland is accepted any fishery must be subject to a number of conditions which are set out in the report.</P>
        <P>I understand that the EU Commission has indicated that it will propose a further extension of the provisions of Council Regulation 579/2011 in the near future. In that regard, I will be seeking amendments that will permit a fishery for White Pollock and for lesser spotted dogfish based on this STECF advice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
        <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,236 children in the care of the state in April 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,601) and residential care (378).</P>
        <P>A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland.</P>
        <P>For a small number of young people (ten at present), the HSE is on occasion required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  These placements are made under the order and supervision of the High Court.</P>
        <P>The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child&rsquo;s social worker visits regularly, and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.   I should emphasise that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual. The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE&rsquo;s National Director for Children and Family Services and my officials.</P>

        <P>The total gross budget for long-term residential care in 2012 is &euro;994.7m.  This is effectively the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme albeit that pre-Nursing Homes Support Scheme arrangements must also be facilitated from within the subhead, i.e. people in contract beds, people who choose to remain on subvention and people who were in public nursing homes prior to the commencement of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>Additional funding of &euro;55 million was originally allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme for 2012.  However, the Minister for Health subsequently decided to transfer &euro;13 million of the &euro;55 million for an initiative being developed by the Special Delivery Unit in 2012 to improve access to care and quality of care for the frail elderly, achieve better patient outcomes and experience as well as better value for money.  A further &euro;5 million was transferred to Primary Care services to underpin overall government policy of shifting focus to primary and community services.</P>
        <P>There were 3,497 applications for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme between January and end-April 2012.  In that same period, 4,242 applications were processed to conclusion.  Of the applications processed to conclusion, 2,885 were approved for funding and 1,358 were withdrawn.  There is nobody on the placement list waiting for funding under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme at present.</P>
        <P>Finally, a public consultation process to inform the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced on the 14th June.  A call for submissions was made in national newspapers and a notice was placed on the Department of Health website.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is the 16th July.  When the public consultation process has concluded, the Department of Health will be seeking tenders through the public procurement process for the carrying out of the review.  This process takes approximately 4 months.  It is anticipated that the review itself will take approximately three months to complete.  It is expected that the review will commence in the last quarter of this year and be completed in early 2013.</P>
        <P>The Terms of Reference for the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme are:</P>
        <P>Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation &mdash; 1.to examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,  2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices,  3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,  4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), and  5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the model for nutrient profiling as developed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in the UK for use in regulating broadcast advertisements for children and that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are proposing using this nutrient profiling model for the purpose of regulating the advertising of foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt to children in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are a range of nutrient profile models in use in other countries.  In the recent WHO report &lsquo;Guiding Principles and Framework Manual for the development or adaptation of nutrient profile models&rsquo; the WHO cites the UK FSA model as an example of a nutrient profiling model.  The Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid resource from my Department, is an education tool and provides broad nutrition advice.  It allows 3 servings a day from the Milk, Yogurt and Cheese shelf of the Food Pyramid.  However the focus is on choosing low fat cheeses regularly as full fat cheeses are high in saturated fat.  Reducing saturated fat is a key target of my Departments Cardiovascular Health Strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council, established in 2007 and the 12 registration boards being established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (the Act), will be responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.</P>
        <P>These 12 professions were designated in the Act which is being implemented on a phased basis, and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is hoped that the remaining 10 registration boards will be established by end 2014.  When a registration board is appointed it will work towards the opening of a statutory register for that profession.</P>
        <P>While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate.  Section 4 of the Act provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including: (a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;  (b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners;  (c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;  (d) The profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development;  (e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;  (f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant.</P>
        <P>The priority at present for my Department is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions specified in the Act in the first instance.  The extension under the Act of statutory registration arrangements for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after the initial designated 12 professional grades have been fully dealt with.  Questions relating to the recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.  Any proposals relating to grade and pay levels would, of course, require the approval of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health and its sub-committees have broad representation from areas such as dentistry, biochemistry, environmental health and public health medicine.  The expert body&rsquo;s reports, position statements and minutes of its meetings are published on its website to ensure transparency.  In evaluating ongoing research on all aspects of fluoridation, the expert body accepts the fundamental scientific tenet that any single piece of scientific evidence by itself remains hypothetical unless it can be repeated or confirmed by other scientists.  Therefore, it considers scientific evidence that has been submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised peer reviewed scientific journals, after such publication has been approved by independent referees.  This ensures that the advice provided by the expert body is impartial and evidence-based.</P>

        <P>The Review of the Irish Penalty Points System, which I recently published, recommends that, in order to effect a targeted reduction in the number of motor cyclist road fatalities, further research into specific penalties for motor cyclists may be merited.  The Review is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications. Once I have received the Committee&rsquo;s input I will consider the adjustment of penalty points further.</P>
        <P>Motor cyclists represent a disproportionate number of road fatalities compared to the number of motor cycles registered.  While the trend is continuing downwards, in 2010 motor cyclists were the third highest category of road user fatalities at 17, behind car users with 130 road fatalities and pedestrians with 44 road fatalities.  To date, in 2012, 7 motor cyclists and 3 pillion passengers have been killed on Irish roads.  According to published OECD figures, a motor cyclist is two to three times more likely to be killed in Ireland than in other European countries.  In terms of fatality rates <i>per 10,000 registered motorcycles</i>, Ireland was found to have the second highest rate amongst the twenty countries compared.</P>

        <P>My Department has received over 2,000 applications for funding under the 2012 Sports Capital Programme.  The process of inputting paper based hard copy applications into the Sports Capital Programme database is on-going.  However, until this process is completed, it is not possible to provide definitive figures for the exact number of applications received or the exact amount of funding sought for the whole country or for individual counties.  When this information is available I intend to publish it on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <P>The aviation market in the EU was fully liberalised in 1992 and the operation of the internal market is governed by common rules which were updated in 2008 and are set out in EU Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 which is directly applicable in Ireland and other Member States.  Therefore airlines are not subject to regulation in areas such as the setting of fares, other charges, routes to fly, etc.  and the decision to charge a passenger for the transport of a musical instrument is at the sole discretion of each airline.  Furthermore, European Regulations in the area of airline operations allow airlines to establish their own procedures for the stowage of baggage and cargo, subject to certain conditions relating to safety and security.</P>
