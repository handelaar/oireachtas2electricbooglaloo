      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I highlighted the farcical situation in the Department of Health and in the health services generally, with health officials sitting on the board of the HSE for very tense meetings in which, acting as health officials one day and HSE board members another day, they are not in a position to agree with each other, and a serious budget overrun which was at &euro;250 million by the end of May and is projected to run to &euro;500 million by the end of the year.  All of that was a direct result of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to get rid of the HSE board without putting anything in its place, which created a significant vacuum at the heart of decision-making in the health services.  The results will be serious for those on the front line and will be serious for patients by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The CEO of the HSE argued cogently to this House and to the Oireachtas committees that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, did not fulfil his side of the Estimate arrangements.  I described the Estimate as dishonest, and I hold by that.  Quite simply, there were figures of &euro;141 million for revenue generation from private insurers and &euro;100 million from drug pricing, as well as a figure for agency staff, which were not based on valid assumptions.  The legislation for private insurance has not yet been produced although the session is nearly finished.  It is a complete mess and it is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>This morning we learn that the CEO of the HSE is to resign.  He is a highly regarded individual with considerable integrity who was placed in an impossible position by the Minister on the budget, management and organisation of the HSE.  Has he been shoved out by the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course he has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach confirm this morning why the CEO of the HSE is leaving?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin had a long tirade there.  He has been asking questions about the production of the HSE governance Bill for some time.  It was cleared yesterday by Cabinet and will be published today.  That Bill will establish seven directorates dealing with hospital care, primary care, mental health, social care, child and family services, public health and corporate shared services.  There will be a much clearer line of accountability in respect of moneys voted by the Oireachtas for the provision of health services, with particular emphasis on the patient and on the front line.  We have made the point on many occasions in the past that the HSE, because of its structure and the way it was initially set up, created a lack of clarity about where the voted moneys were being spent and how effective that spending was.  The May report produced by the HSE clearly shows overruns in some areas.  Some of these are because of increased hospital activity, increased throughput of patients in accident and emergency departments and so on.</P>
        <P>I understand that for some time the chief executive, Mr. Cathal Magee, has been discussing with the Department of Health the intended changes to the structure of the HSE in the context of the governance Bill.  Having considered the new structure that is to be established, Mr. Magee indicated that it is his intention to depart when the transition takes place.  I thank him for his service as a person of integrity and commitment.  The answer to Deputy Martin&rsquo;s question is in the negative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether the Taoiseach accepts it or not, the current management of the health service is a shambles.</P>

	<P>The deficit of Galway University Hospital is &euro;7 million, Drogheda is at &euro;6 million, Beaumont is at &euro;8 million, Tallaght is at &euro;7.5 million, the Mater is at &euro;5 million, Cork University Hospital is at &euro;5 million and St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital is at &euro;6 million.  I am not the only one saying this.</P>

	<P>I cannot hear it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody out there in the health service is saying the situation is not sustainable.  We have already seen the high-profile resignation of the CEO of the VHI because of disagreements with the Minister.  We have a volatile Minister, and senior personnel have left the health service because of his behaviour and the manner in which he deals with people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The exit of the CEO of the HSE is being masked by a re-labelling of positions.  It is being labelled as some sort of fundamental redrawing of the architecture of health, which fools nobody.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin is over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The bottom line is this.  The Government is running out of time.  It prepared a false Estimate for health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Deputy Martin please ask his question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is without question that the Minister did so.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister put the CEO of the HSE in an impossible position 12 months ago when he abolished the board of the HSE and established the Secretary General as chairman of the board.</P>

	<P>Without question, he is being shoved out of that position in an unacceptable manner by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is wrecking the disability service as well.  There are 220 young people looking for a service.</P>

	<P>It is utterly hypocritical of Deputy Martin to get up there and say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy McGrath was Bertie&rsquo;s mudguard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is completely hypocritical of Deputy Martin to stand up there and say that the chief executive of the HSE is being pushed by the Minister and in the next sentence say that the management of the HSE is in a shambles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that; I said the health services.</P>

	<P>The Government is showing complete disregard for the concerns of Gaeltacht communities and Irish language organisations by pushing a highly deficient Gaeltacht Bill through the Oireachtas.  T&aacute; easpa muin&iacute;ne ag pobail Gaeltachta agus ag daoine a dh&eacute;anann a gcuid oibre tr&eacute; Ghaeilge i mBille na Gaeltachta.  The Government has refused to hold proper consultations with Irish language organisations and Gaeltacht communities or to accept any amendments &mdash; not one amendment has been accepted from Sinn F&eacute;in or any of the other parties.  As the Taoiseach knows, this Bill will strip Gaeltacht communities of their right to democratic representation on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Government has also rejected any role for the Irish language commissioner in overseeing the various plans envisaged.  This is despite the fact the office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga is widely acknowledged as being the most effective and appropriate in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill puts the bulk of responsibility on voluntary organisations and increases responsibilities for an unelected &uacute;dar&aacute;s and other local organisations but refuses to accept that any additional resources are required.  It is being rushed through to avoid an &uacute;dar&aacute;s election.  It should be withdrawn because it is bad legislation.  Will the Government withdraw this Bill, go back to the drawing board and come back with a Bill more in keeping with the 20-year strategy for the language?</P>

	<P>T&aacute; a fhios mhaith ag an Teachta Adams gurb &eacute; an t-Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta McGinley, an duine is fearr sa Teach a bhfuil Gaeilge aige le blianta fada.  T&aacute; suim iontach domhain ag an Aire St&aacute;it i bhforbairt na teanga.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil cinneadh d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas nach dtofar an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s mar a rinneadh le blianta anuas.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil orainn an Bille seo a chur tr&iacute;d an D&aacute;il roimh sos an tsamhraidh.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil orainn an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a chr&iacute;ochn&uacute; D&eacute;ardaoin.</P>
        <P>N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir don Teachta a r&aacute; nach raibh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht n&oacute; cainteanna ag an Aire St&aacute;it le muintir na Gaeltachta n&oacute; le daoine thart faoin t&iacute;r.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>N&iacute; d&uacute;irt m&eacute; rud ar bith faoin Aire St&aacute;it.  N&iacute; d&uacute;irt m&eacute; nach raibh suim aige sa cheist.  Creidim go bhfuil an t-Aire St&aacute;it m&iacute;cheart.  N&iacute; bheidh muintir na Gaeltachta &aacute;balta v&oacute;tail ar bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  Quango eile a bh&eacute;as ann i ndiaidh an phr&oacute;iseis seo.</P>
        <P>Aonta&iacute;m leis an Taoiseach go ndearna an St&aacute;t teip ar an dteanga &oacute; buna&iacute;odh &eacute;.  Is &iacute; sin &aacute;r dteanga at&aacute; &aacute; labhairt sa t&iacute;r le 20,000 bliain anuas.  There were 250,000 Irish language speakers in the Gaeltacht when this State was founded and there are now only 25,000, so there is obviously a failure.  It is not just that the language is dying; the language is being killed off, not least by bad legislation like this.  It flies in the face of expert advice.  It also flies very particularly in the face of the 20-year strategy, and I have met the Minister of State to discuss this.  The vast majority of Irish language groups in the State are calling for this Bill to be suspended so amendments can be introduced to fix what they perceive to be problems.</P>
        <P>Is there not something wrong when a Government does not accept one single amendment, not just from Sinn F&eacute;in but from all of the other parties?  T&aacute; s&eacute; de chumhacht ag an Aire St&aacute;it an rud ceart a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; a fhios sin ag an Taoiseach.  Why does the Government not bring in a one-line Bill to postpone the &uacute;dar&aacute;s elections for six months?  This Bill is being rushed because the &uacute;dar&aacute;s elections are due in September.  Why not suspend the elections for six months and then allow for a more detailed discussion on all the issues involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The time has come to deal with this.  The Government has made a clear decision about the structure and nature of the new &uacute;dar&aacute;s and what its function, role and responsibility will be.  I accept Deputy Adams&rsquo;s assertion that he does not cast any slight upon the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, who has had a passion for the Irish language from childhood and since he came into the House.  I also accept the Deputy&rsquo;s observation that we have not measured up in terms of having our language flourish as it should.  It is true that the number of daily speakers has declined seriously; however, it is also true that many more people have a smattering of the language now than was the case previously, although perhaps they do not have the opportunity to use it often.</P>
        <P>It is also very obvious that the urbanisation of Ireland has had a direct impact, with 55% of people now living in the greater urban areas.  In this city, i gcathair &Aacute;tha Cliath, t&aacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt anois n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; le blianta fada.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu sa chathair seo faoi l&aacute;thair, agus a labhrann &iacute; go minic nuair a bh&iacute;onn an seans acu, n&aacute; i gcuid des na Gaeltachta&iacute; le blianta anuas.  I notice that in Dublin people do want to avail of the opportunity to speak the language.  What the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, is doing here is to put in place a structure under which we have clear plans from areas that are called Gaeltachta&iacute; about what they want to do to preserve, strengthen and develop the language in the time ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not withdrawing the Bill; we are getting on with it.  There is no point in putting this off any longer.  The Deputy asked for the Bill to be withdrawn and for a delay to the &uacute;dar&aacute;s elections.  I do not want any difficulty or lack of clarity about this.  The Minister of State is following through on the Government decision.  We will set up the new &uacute;dar&aacute;s with its new functions and get on with it in the interests of the language and those who wish to speak it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Quango eile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not so long ago that the Government was promising to break away from the old and begin a new politics.  Reform, transparency and fairness were the talk of the day, and we all know how that has worked out.  While the extravagant pay rates for special advisers are constantly breaching the pay cap, cuts to social welfare payments and indirect taxes have ravaged the low-income people of this country.  Jobs are as sparse now as they ever were, while more and more people are being forced to emigrate to make a living.</P>
        <P>It seems the poor are becoming poorer while the rich just keep getting richer.  In fact, the gap between rich and poor in Ireland is constantly widening, with disposable income for the least well off falling by over 18% while income for the most well off has increased by over 4%.  The top 10% of the population receives almost 14 times more disposable income than the poorest 10%.  Surely the Taoiseach will agree there is something profoundly wrong in that.</P>
        <P>We also have a situation in which, as a result of the reduced rates of social welfare payments, young people who are made homeless are left trapped in emergency accommodation because they cannot get the assistance that will allow them to make a life for themselves.  This could be easily resolved, and addressing it would actually reduce the cost to the State rather than costing money.  This is yet another group which has been failed by the Government as a result of its attack on the vulnerable.  It is clear from this that the Taoiseach and his Government continue to make questionable decisions that result in a lopsided distribution of wealth when so many people are struggling on low incomes to make ends meet.  As we move into the budget preparation season, will the Taoiseach pledge that the upcoming budget will not include further cuts for those who have suffered so much already?  Will he commit to equality-proofing the budget measures to determine their impact on people on very low incomes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not comment on what the Government will do in respect of the budget to be prepared for 2013 but in budget 2012, the Government renegotiated the memorandum of understanding with the troika and reversed the minimum wage cut introduced by the previous Government.  It also renegotiated the universal social charge with the troika, and that liability was removed from 330,000 people.  In addition, it did not increase income tax, and there was no cut in the basic rates of social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>We face a challenging time ahead, and the Government will apply itself to that in meeting the targets we have set out and the ceilings that have been put in place and will make its decisions based on being as fair as possible.  Those who can contribute should and will contribute to enable our country to get out of the programme we are in and retrieve our economic independence.</P>
        <P>In some of the key measures in last year&rsquo;s budget, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and deposit interest retention tax were increased to 30%.  The tax-free thresholds for CAT have been reduced to take account of the fall in asset values in recent years.  It is not true to say, therefore, that the Government did not act in respect of the lower paid and the more vulnerable.  We are very conscious of people on the housing lists, those who are homeless, and those in lower paid positions.</P>
        <P>The priority of the Government must be to reduce the live register figures substantially in terms of the long-term unemployed.  That is, in part, the reason the agenda from Europe has changed.  There is now an interest in a growth agenda, which is why the European Investment Bank representatives were here recently.  That is the reason the Government was able to introduce a stimulus package yesterday of &euro;2 billion, which will not sort out our problems and will not take effect for some time but shows the increased interest on the part of the European Investment Bank in participating in a growth agenda for this country that will create jobs, boost the local economy, and deal with some of the issues the Deputy mentioned.  As far as budget 2013 is concerned, the Government will apply itself to that in the months ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>For the first time in its history, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has described the position of low-income families as critical.  That is as a result of the budgets the Taoiseach has spoken about, and measures such as increasing the minimum wage have not made any difference or had any real impact.  In fact, inequality is widening as a result of the budgets the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government is introducing.  We have the fourth lowest tax take, as a percentage of GDP, in the European Union.  If the Taoiseach only made the decision to move up to the average, he would be doing a great deal to ensure that the people on the lowest incomes and those who are struggling the most in this society would not carry the burden.  It is not too much to ask people such as those of us in this House and other high earners to contribute more and pay a fairer share.  That is what the Taoiseach&rsquo;s budget should do, and that is the reason I ask that he equality-proof his budget to ensure it does not increase the inequality in society.  That is something the Taoiseach should be able to do, and I ask him to do that for budget 2013.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, the Supreme Court overturned the 2007 ruling of the High Court to allow former members of consortiums that submitted successful bids for the mobile telephony licence in the 1990s to seek damages for alleged fraud, conspiracy, deceit, corruption and so on in public office.  Last year, the Moriarty tribunal made clear findings regarding the awarding of that licence.  In that context, does the Taoiseach accept the findings of the Moriarty tribunal?  Can he outline to the House the timeframe for implementing the legislation the Government has promised as a result of the findings and recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Supreme Court made its decision yesterday, and the matter will be returned to the High Court.  As I said yesterday at the press conference, I would like to reflect on the written judgment of the Supreme Court, which will not be available for quite some time, to determine whether there are any implications for the State.  This is a private matter which will now return to the High Court.  Mr. Justice Moriarty made his findings very clear in regard to the issuance of the licence, and his findings stand.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam faoi reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; f&oacute;graithe.  Yesterday, the Government announced plans to hold a referendum on a reorganisation of the structure of the courts, including the setting up of a court of civil appeal and a new unified family court.  When does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation to provide for that referendum, and when does he expect the referendum to be held?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality also stated that the Taoiseach is considering changes to Article 26 of the Constitution, which gives the President power to refer Bills to the Supreme Court.  What role does the constitutional convention play in any of that?  Will these different propositions become the work and remit of the constitutional convention or will the Government bypass it?</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The programme for Government contains a clear commitment to have family law courts and a court of civil appeal.  The Government authorised the Minister for Justice and Equality to begin the process of discussions with the Attorney General that will lead to its becoming a reality.  Clearly, when the constitutional convention starts its work in September it will be quite entitled to reflect in due course upon these issues and others that it might consider necessary.  The Minister for Justice and Equality did not indicate any timescale for the process of work which will lead to a referendum in due course in regard to the commitments in the programme for Government.  Obviously, that will not prevent the constitutional convention from reflecting upon those matters also.</P>

	<P>We have welcomed the establishment of the constitutional convention, but it strikes me that it is limited and this is further proof that it is limited.  Would it not be better to put these matters on the cl&aacute;r of the constitutional convention to have them dealt with?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The constitutional convention has a specific remit to give its views on a number of defined issues, but it is not confined to that area of work alone.  It can consider these or other areas on which it wishes to make its observations or views known.  It can do so in the normal way.  What it considers will be part of its function.</P>

A long series of discussions will have to take place about their nature, scope and responsibility and what will happen in the future.  The constitutional convention can add to the discussion in a perfectly normal way.</P>

	<P>With regard to the business to be conducted in the D&aacute;il between now and tomorrow evening when this session ends, many stressed homeowners will hope the report to be released today on the pyrite disaster will provide for a resolution to the nightmare and mental anguish they have suffered as a result of being innocent victims of negligence on the part of sections of the construction industry.  Will the Taoiseach commit to introducing legislation as early as possible to resolve this nightmare?  Since the D&aacute;il is rising tomorrow, will he ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to make a statement and perhaps provide for questions tomorrow on the report and the actions that could be taken?  Some of the leaks are worrying.  It has been suggested the report does not find anybody to blame, which means householders could still be running around years from now seeking redress.  That would not be acceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a difficult process and a disaster for people who worked hard, got their mortgages, bought their houses and found there was a problem.  The Government has commissioned the report and focused on what happened, the scale of the problem and what needs to be done.  The report clearly points to the setting up of a resolution board where all of those involved &mdash; quarries, contractors, insurance companies and others &mdash; would sit around a table.  If they are unable to come up with a voluntary solution, the Government will consider imposing a levy on the industry.  The people affected deserve to have their houses repaired.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, are dealing with aspects of the alcohol issue.  As the previous sub-committee meeting on social policy there was a detailed discussion on the serious issues involved.  The sub-committee mandated the Minister of State to bring her recommendations to the committee.  The next meeting will be entirely devoted to the alcohol issue, including the aspects the Minister is dealing with, including the separation of alcohol in retail outlets and a number of other matters.  When the sub-committee concludes its review of the presentations to be made by the Minister of State and the Minister, it will be brought to the Government and we will act on the matter as speedily as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of serious matters are involved.

	<P>No, but it obviously is a matter about which the Minister for Justice and Equality is concerned in his discussions with the Commissioner.  As the Deputy is aware, licence conditions are attached to such events and they obviously are being reviewed in the light of what happened, namely, the appalling carry-on in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2012 before the House and will inform Members of the background to the Bill and the reason for this short item of legislation.  As I informed the Seanad, where I introduced this Bill, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010 includes provisions that deem all holders of valid firearm certificates issued for shotguns between 1 August 2009 and 31 July 31 2012 to be the holders of a hunting licence under the Wildlife Acts for the purposes of hunting game bird and hare species.  This provision was introduced at the time to address an issue which arose following the introduction of a new computerised firearm licensing system by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It was the case, prior to the enactment of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010, that the Wildlife Acts required a hunter to have a licence to hunt certain game birds, such as pheasant and partridge, as well as hares.  The Wildlife Acts provide that this would be obtained as an endorsement on the hunter&rsquo;s firearm certificate.  Both the hunting licence and the firearm certificate were issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the form of a shotgun licence with the appropriate endorsement for hunting.  However, new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na computerised procedures introduced in 2009 for issuing three-year firearm certificates omitted the facility for issuing the endorsement as a wildlife hunting licence.  At that time, it was not practicable to recall the new firearm certificates issued or to change the licensing process that was in train.  Accordingly, provisions were included in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010 to allow a hunter in possession of a firearm certificate to shoot game birds and hare species during the open seasons.  These provisions will lapse on 31 July 2012.</P>
        <P>Discussions have taken place between my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the enactment of these provisions.  These discussions considered the question of amending the firearm certificate application form and the certificate itself to accommodate the hunting endorsement.  The outcome of these discussions, however, is that a suitable technical solution is not possible at reasonable cost in the short term.  Therefore, I consider that the most viable option is to extend the existing arrangements, pending a more thorough review of the Wildlife Acts.  I should point out to Members there is a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to publish new consolidated wildlife legislation in 2014.  I believe such consolidated legislation to be necessary, given the primary wildlife legislation is now almost 40 years old.  The most appropriate context for the consideration of all issues surrounding wildlife, including hunting and hunting licences, is as part of this overall review.  Accordingly, I consider that in the interim, the current arrangements should be continued and persons with a valid firearm certificate should be deemed to have a hunting licence under the Wildlife Acts beyond 31 July 2012.</P>
        <P>This requires a short technical amendment to the Wildlife Acts, which is set out in section 1 of the Bill.  Otherwise, if this is not done, hunters would be hunting unlawfully after 31 July 2012.  I should point out this Bill does not give hunters any new privileges or unrestricted permission to hunt protected birds and hares on a year-round basis.  The hunting season for game birds under the open season is restricted for most wildfowl to a period from 1 September to the end of January.  In the case of popular game birds such as pheasant and partridge, the open season is shorter and extends from 1 November to the end of January.  The open season for hares is from the end of September to the end of February.  I acknowledge there are gun clubs in nearly every rural parish around the country.  Many Members of this House are aware of the popularity of game shooting during the winter months and of the importance of this activity to the local economy.  This Bill will allow hunters to continue their sporting activity in a legal manner without interruption during the open seasons.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Browne.  I welcome this legislation before the House, which as the Minister noted, is both short and technical in nature.  Moreover, just as Fianna F&aacute;il did not oppose the Bill in the Seanad, we will not oppose it in this House.  The Minister has outlined the rationale and reasoning behind the need for this Bill, which go back to the time when the system for issuing three-year firearm certificates was computerised.  At the time, the stipulation for a facility to endorse the firearm certificate to permit wildlife hunting was omitted.  Three years later, this issue has not been rectified and this Bill is only a temporary measure which merely kicks the problem down the road and delays it for a further three years.  Has the Minister considered implementing a more comprehensive solution to the issue?  As matters stand, not everyone who has a firearm is engaged in game shooting but on foot of this legislation, anyone with a firearm, be it a handgun or whatever, is permitted to use it for game shooting.  The Minister has now been in office for more than 16 months and this is only the second legislative item he has brought before the House.  I would have thought there might have been an opportunity during that time to bring forward more comprehensive legislation to solve this issue indefinitely in the future, rather than simply kicking the can and putting in place a temporary measure for a three-year period.  He might outline if he has any plans to rectify the situation on a more permanent basis.</P>
        <P>There was a high level of publicity surrounding the ban on stag hunting a few years ago.  The parties now in Government were very cynical in opposition at the time in their approach to the issue.  Deputies who were very much against blood sports came out against the ban and some Deputies made a promise to the people in the affected area that this ban would be rescinded once they come to power.  I know that part of the country well as it where my partner is from, and it was one of the main issues in the area during the last general election.  As it was a commitment made during the last general election campaign, I thought the Government parties might have used the opportunity arising from this Bill to rescind the ban on stag hunting, as previously promised.  We are now getting conflicting reports on that.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee &mdash; a man I greatly admire &mdash; has said that it is only a matter of time until it is rescinded, and then the Taoiseach said that was his own personal opinion.  As the person with ultimate responsibility in this area, perhaps the Minister might indicate his own position and the Government&rsquo;s position on this issue.  The people of Meath East have a great interest in it.  The Government is in power for 16 months and it would be nice to see a more concrete decision on endorsing the firearms licences, rather than just kicking the can three years down the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Troy for sharing time.  I welcome the Bill, even though it has taken some time to get here.  The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for an extension of the current hunting licence provisions for the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010.  It removes the end date for certain provisions in that Act.  All shotgun licences issued after 1 August 2009 will be valid for use by hunters to hunt lawfully wild birds and hares within the appropriate open seasons.</P>
        <P>We have a gun club in every parish and half parish across the country.  The sport is very popular and there was a very emotive debate around the country when the last Bill came before the House.  Many halls in rural Ireland were packed to capacity, with people criticising the Bill at the time and the issue of shooting wildlife.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is going to publish consolidated wildlife legislation in 2014, under the national biodiversity plan for 2011 to 2016.  Perhaps he might explain why it is taking until 2014 to do this.  It is a bit like the &euro;2 billion announcement yesterday as everything seems to be built around 2014 and 2015.  If I was cynical I would think it had something to do with the local elections in 2014, but perhaps that is not the case.  Consolidated legislation is necessary, given that the primary wildlife legislation is there for the last 40 years and it needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>There seems to be much disquiet about the issuing of licences and the activities of superintendents in Garda stations.  People are not happy about the non-issuing of licences and the holding of guns in that area.  In a recent case the judge threw out many of the defences put forward by the State.  What road is the Minister going to take?  I know this might be more of an issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, but it seems strange that the State would be spending huge amounts of money on defending certain areas only to find judges throwing out the cases.  Perhaps there is a better way of doing things.</P>
        <P>It seems that every firearm licence issued will now also be a hunting licence.  Before this change, a person had to apply and be assessed for a hunting licence.  Can the Minister clarify that?  People who are licensed to hold handguns will now also have a hunting licence.  If my memory serves me right from the last time this legislation went through the House, it was an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not apply to handguns.  I am just applying the exact same provisions as the Deputy&rsquo;s Government did two years ago.  There is no change whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is copying us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Some people have contacted me to say there is now a blanket issue of hunting licences, whether or not it is required or whether a person is entitled to it on lawful grounds and so on.  Will people who had a conviction and lost their licence under the Wildlife Acts now automatically get back their licence under these new provisions?  The Minister needs to clarify these issues, but overall we welcome the fact the Bill is before the House.  When our legislation came was brought in, both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party cynically tried to use it to embarrass the Government of the day.  We are not going down that road now, but it is important that the consolidation of the wildlife legislation be brought forward from 2014, which seems to be a long time away.</P>
        <P>This has been a very emotive issue in recent years and perhaps that will happen again when we consolidate the legislation.  While there is a gun club in every parish and half parish, some of them are involved in different aspects of the sport.  I do not know if the Minister has visited the Wexford Slobs since he took office, but I think he should do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly have.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed he did not invite me.  The first geese came to the Wexford Slobs in 1898.  They were greylags from Iceland, and were the common winter goose in Ireland at the time.  However, white-fronted geese from Greenland first appeared in the Wexford Slobs in 1910 and numbered several thousand in the middle of the 1930s, and they replaced the greylags.  Around 10,000 white-fronted geese &mdash; one third of the world population &mdash; spend the winter on the Wexford Slobs.  A great number of people visit the area in the winter months to see these geese for themselves.  It is important that this area would be protected.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will pass all Stages as quickly as possible.  We are looking forward to the consolidated legislation to which the Minister refers and I hope he can explain why it is taking until 2014 for this to happen.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2012.  It makes perfect sense to extend the current hunting licence provisions in the Wildlife Act 2010 that allow a hunter in possession of a firearm certificate to shoot wild birds and hares during the open season.  The environment is a key asset for Ireland and as such it must be protected and proactively managed to ensure it forms the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s economic well being.  Our natural environment, with its rich ecosystems, abundant biodiversity and spectacular landscapes, has also a central and important role to play in creating a healthy society and national well being.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment has the potential to make a positive contribution to wildlife conservation and lead to an increase in the numbers of people holidaying in rural Ireland.  The latter point is important, particularly when one considers the depressed state of the economy and the dramatic decline in manufacturing and industrial activity.  The loss of jobs in these sectors and the shift in the labour market to more service-oriented employment increase the importance of the tourism sector to the recovery of the economy.</P>
        <P>Ireland is exceptionally well positioned to tap into the international tourism market with its rich heritage, environmentally clean ecosystem and rich biodiversity.  However, the overall challenge is that as the key sectors of the economy develop and recover, to ensure they do so in a sustainable way, while decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures.  This means that our natural resources and environmental conditions that are so important to the economic and social well-being of Ireland&rsquo;s future generations they must be protected from overuse and degradation.  For example, a clean environment with high standards of water and air quality is a critical component of good quality of life.  Abundant biodiversity and healthy soil are also important aspects of our natural environment that are essential for healthy living.  Maintaining biodiversity and the natural environment from further loss and destruction is of vital importance if we are to tap into these crucial resources to transform the economy and create sustainable communities in which people can find permanent and secure employment.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s marine and terrestrial environment supports a wide variety of species and habitats, many of which are of international importance.  While many species are doing well in conservation terms, a significant number of habitats and species are not.  It must be acknowledged that significant progress has been made in the designation of EU protected areas in Ireland, but several areas of national importance remain undesignated.  Significant aspects of biodiversity are under constant threat from overdevelopment and generally unsustainable activities.  In this sense, it is of the utmost importance that we value and conserve the intrinsic worth of our natural resources.  They are key assets for the State and it is imperative we protect this wealth for future generations.</P>
        <P>Tourism in Ireland should preserve its quality.  Its green image should be inspired by principles of minimal environmental impact, respect for and support of local cultures and traditions, enhancing a formative experience for the tourist that strives for quality, not quantity, while guaranteeing its conservation for future generations.  The sector of sustainable tourism is long overdue for development.  Moreover, the international market for more sustainable options is well advanced outside Ireland, with more tourists each year requesting ecological and sustainable experiences here.  Sustainable tourism development has the potential to create thousands of jobs, revitalise rural communities suffering from a wave of mass emigration and conserve our natural habitats.  Sinn F&eacute;in will, therefore, be supporting the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2012.</P>

	<P>For a Bill that almost contains one sentence, a lot of time has been allocated to debate it.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 in order that holders of shotgun licences can continue to use their firearms during the open season.  This is a practical, sensible step that maintains the current process of applying for a licence to hold a firearm and continues it into the future.  According to the 2010 Act, the window for applications after 2009 is to be closed at the beginning of August 2012.  This legislation removes that window and those in possession of firearms will simply comply with the general obligations on firearm owners in renewing licences, etc.  This will allow hunters to continue hunting during the open season without having to renew their licences during that period.  Proper controls and legislation for the possession of firearms are necessary as there are 233,120 registered firearms.  Gun registration is rightly stringent in the State and we support the idea that this should continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>When considering the subject of hunting game, it is important that the right balance is struck between conservation and hunting.  It is also important to recognise that local gun clubs are often the greatest promoters of conservation and the successful management of wildlife and birds.  This can be said about my local gun club, the Glenfarne Gun Club.  In 2007 it developed the Boleybrack red grouse habitat management plan for the purposes of restoring the Irish red grouse population on the beautiful Boleybrack Mountain.  I hope it will continue to be beautiful and that we will not allow the frackers in to destroy it.  The plan is entering year five of implementation and its success would not have been possible without the support of the commonage owners and the local community of Glenfarne.  All work on the project has been carried out on a voluntary basis by members of Glenfarne Gun Club with technical assistance and advice from the Golden Eagle Trust and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  This is probably the first instance where a group of local people sought the assistance of the NPWS for a project.  The project has been a resounding success and the way local farmers, the gun club and the NPWS work together is a joy to behold.  The success of the project has raised awareness of the red grouse nationally and been a spur for the establishment of other similar projects elsewhere.  During the summer, if the Minister is in County Leitrim, he should give me a call and I will take him to the beautiful Boleybrack Mountain to see the project.  He will be very proud of what the NPWS is doing in co-operation with the local gun club and farmers.  There is generally a distrust between the NPWS and farming communities.  Most farmers claim that the NPWS is out to restrict their ability to develop their farms through the cutting back of the number of sheep and so forth.  Recently, when speaking to a NPWS worker, he informed me the service would like it if there were more sheep on Boleybrack Mountain.</P>
        <P>Red grouse are on the red list of birds of concern in terms of their conservation owing to a decline in their breeding range nationally of over 60% in 30 years.  Of all the factors that influence their survival, the two most important are predator control and heather management.  The legal control of predators such as the fox and grey crow can benefit both bird conservation and sheep farming.  I, therefore, welcome the proposal to introduce a new wildlife Bill in 2014.  There should be a wide discussion on how we can manage the conservation process and designate areas as special areas of conservation, SACs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs, coursing and wildlife issues.  It would be useful to have a broad consultation process in the development of the new wildlife Bill, to which Sinn F&eacute;in would contribute positively.</P>
        <P>It is often stated people do not trust politicians.  Since I became a Member, it has been my experience that in many cases politicians do not trust people.  In a democracy we must do so.  When we do, they will do the right thing.  We must, therefore, make it easy for them to do so.  The project at Boleybrack Mountain, Glenfarne, County Leitrim shows that if one talks to local people to get their ideas and if they trust the agencies of the State to assist them in doing the right thing, we will all &mdash; the State, its citizens and wildlife &mdash; have a better future together.  The lesson the project teaches us is that we must deal with matters in a particular way.  We would do well if we were to adopt the approach taken there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that, even though they relate to the remits of two Ministers, we are debating the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2012 in advance of dealing with the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012.  The Bill before the House is technical in nature and deals with the current hunting licence provisions relating to the shooting of wild birds and hares during open season.  In the hunting of birds there is a need to put in place a protocol on the numbers of certain species hunted in order that we might monitor the impact.  We must ensure changes in the level of hunting pressure are monitored and I wonder how it is proposed to do this.  There is also a need to review the listed species of birds which are hunted in open season, particularly as some of these are of concern, both nationally and on an EU basis, in terms of their conservation.  Wildlife in Ireland is a good indicator of the impact of environmental changes and, therefore, the question of monitoring is significant.  We are aware that some species such as the breeding curlew and other breeding wader species are suffering a serious decline in numbers.</P>
        <P>I will deal with the poor hare.  I do not know what the hare has ever done to Irish society to justify the treatment meted out to it, first, as a result of many years of coursing and now by virtue of the fact that people will be able to shoot it.  The Minister referred to open season which, for hares, will be five months long.  However, open season for hares lasts all 12 months of the year.</P>
        <P>My predecessor, the late Tony Gregory, was associated with a number of causes in combating illegal drugs and crime, promoting the interests of street traders and obtaining housing for people.  Animal welfare was another cause central to his philosophy.  It was one of his deep regrets that more had not been done to progress the issue of animal welfare before he died.  In particular, he was concerned about the treatment of animals such as the hare, the fox, the badger and the stag.  I am absolutely appalled to think the ban on stag hunting may be rescinded.  That would be a retrograde step.</P>
        <P>Tony Gregory was honoured to serve as vice president of the Irish Council Against Bloodsports when the late Hugh Leonard was its president.  He used various mechanisms of parliamentary procedure to highlight the cause of animals and issues of cruelty.  As the Minister is aware, in 1993 he sponsored a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on wildlife.  When he was introducing the Bill, he paid tribute to the democratic process for allowing an Independent Member to take that course of action.  He considered that wildlife was a matter of immense public concern and interest and referred to &ldquo;the welfare of the vulnerable and defenceless in nature&rsquo;s creation.&rdquo;  He hoped his Bill would help to end the &ldquo;mediaeval barbarity of live hare coursing.&rdquo;  He acknowledged the pressure Members representing rural constituencies would be under to oppose the Bill.  He also acknowledged that coursing clubs formed a very powerful lobby in some rural areas.  Given that he came from Dublin Central, he was not under pressure from any lobby.  However, he asked that Members be allowed to decide for themselves whether there was a need to change the cruel practice of coursing.  This did not happen and, therefore, coursing was not banned in 1993.  Many hares have suffered a cruel end as a result.  I take the opportunity to state I object to the term &ldquo;sport&rdquo; being applied to coursing.  There is no sport involved in either coursing or, as proposed in the Bill, shooting hares.</P>
        <P>Tony Gregory was not the first person to try to have hare coursing banned in Ireland.  The first attempt was made in November 1975 when the current President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, then a Senator, tried to have legislation relating to wildlife being dealt with in the Upper House amended in order to have coursing declared illegal.  His efforts in this regard were backed by another former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, then a Senator, and the late Dr. Noel Browne.  During the Committee Stage debate on the Wildlife Bill 1975 he stated, &ldquo;My view is that the barbaric practice of hare coursing should be stopped immediately.&rdquo;  One of the Senators of the day who was in favour of coursing made the following comment, &ldquo;There is scope for escapes.  Those hares are properly trained today.&rdquo;  I wonder for what they were being trained.  Another Member of the Upper House stated, &ldquo;Coursing is fundamental to our greyhound industry.&rdquo;  I do not agree with that assertion.  There are only three countries, including Ireland, in which coursing is legal and other countries which have banned it have thriving greyhound industries.  One of the Senators to whom I refer and who was in favour of coursing also stated, &ldquo;The hares are adequately and perfectly cared for, both prior to the coursing meeting concerned and afterwards.&rdquo;  I was bemused by the use of the word &ldquo;afterwards&rdquo;, particularly as the former Senator in question was speaking prior to the introduction of muzzling.  In such circumstances, I am not too sure how many hares would have survived coursing meetings and required care afterwards.</P>
        <P>Mrs. Mary Robinson said, &ldquo;Coursing is a very cruel sport&rdquo; and referred to &ldquo;the principle of trying to prevent unnecessary and deliberate cruelty to animals.&rdquo;  The late Dr. Noel Browne referred to the hare as &ldquo;one of the gentlest of God&rsquo;s created animals&rdquo; and the fact that very fast greyhounds were used to inflict &ldquo;inevitably and invariably, unnecessary pain on this tiny animal.&rdquo;  He also described coursing as a barbaric practice.  It is interesting that at the time in question the British House of Commons had just passed legislation to abolish hare coursing.  As Deputies are aware, a high percentage of MPs in the House of Commons would have believed in blood sports.  However, they passed an Act to ban the practice of coursing.</P>
        <P>During the debate to which I refer the late Dr. Noel Browne commented, &ldquo;Speaking as a psychiatrist, it is worth examining the kind of people who indulge in this masochistic practice.&rdquo;  He also wondered about the emotional make-up of those to whom he referred in the context of their enjoying &ldquo;the sound of an animal screaming to death, being torn to pieces.&rdquo;  He associated that kind of enjoyment which what would have then been obtained in &ldquo;the more disreputable night spots in Soho.&rdquo;  I do not think one would have to go to Soho to obtain such enjoyment nowadays because I am sure it is available much closer to home.  I should note that all of the points made in the 1975 debate came prior to the Irish Coursing Club being forced to muzzle dogs at enclosed coursing meetings.  The next political push to have hare coursing banned was initiated by the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.</P>
        <P>Let us consider what the supposedly humane practice of muzzling has done for the hare.  About one month before each meeting club members go out into the countryside to collect hares in a process known as &ldquo;netting&rdquo;.  This involves a gang of supporters shouting and yelling to herd hares into nets which have been strategically placed.  The hares are then put into boxes for transport to the coursing venue.  These are another two instances of cruelty, but the Bill does not go into much detail on this aspect.  The next stage of the process involves training hares.  Perhaps the animals have a better chance of survival if they are the subject of coursing rather than being pursued by hunters with guns.  However, that is debatable.  Releasing a wild hare into a coursing field produces what coursing supporters see as very poor sport because it would not know where to run.  During the training weeks hares are kept herded together in a enclosure.  This adds considerably to the stress suffered by the hares which are solitary creatures and keep to themselves in the wild.  They do not live together in groups.  In captivity, therefore, they are very prone to disease which can spread more easily when they are kept together in an enclosure.</P>
        <P>As a result of the level of secrecy relating to coursing and other blood sports, it is difficult to obtain accurate statistics for them.  It is also difficult to know who to believe.  We are informed that on coursing days each hare should only be coursed once.  However, it is important to note in this regard that coursing clubs are monitored by coursing officials, not by an independent body.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the practice known as &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; is widespread.  I know this for a fact because many greyhound owners state their animals must be blooded before they can take part in coursing.  They use rabbits and kittens for this practice to enhance the performance of the greyhound.  The owners of greyhounds who want to race their dogs on tracks must first register them with the Irish Coursing Club.  This represents an enforced subsidy in respect of coursing.</P>
        <P>The majority are opposed to hare coursing.  I am sure they would also be opposed to the hunting and shooting of hares.  Many independent surveys have been carried out of this matter during the years.  <i>TheJournal.ie</i> recently carried out a poll which showed that a considerable majority were in favour of banning hare coursing until, very suddenly, the numbers of those in favour of it not being banned rose.  It was at that point that the staff of <i>TheJournal.ie</i> discovered an attempt to rig the poll &mdash; they have proof of this &mdash; by people who were pro-coursing.</P>
        <P>All animal welfare organisations are opposed to coursing.  What, therefore, is the justification for trapping hares or any other animals and using them and their pain as a form of entertainment?  There is only a small minority who get pleasure from and bet on hares fighting for their lives as they are chased and terrorised by greyhounds.  The activity of coursing is one-sided and the same side always wins.  Greyhounds might be muzzled, but the hares are terrorised, injured and some have died.  The hare is fighting for its life and is not aware that the greyhound is muzzled.  Muzzling does not prevent hares from being tossed up in the air and injured.  The lucky hare that reaches the escape area without being caught by the dogs is caught in an enclosure.  We do not know what happens to those hares because we do not have the figures.  They probably live to fight another day.  Perhaps they are released to be shot under the terms of the Bill before the House.  The animal we are talking about is chased by the greyhound, which is a much bigger animal.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am talking about animals, including the hare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not talking about coursing.  It is not a Bill on coursing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  I am using the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  I just had to remind you of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair.  I would like to make a point about the greyhound before I leave this issue.  The greyhound is also a gentle animal.  Greyhounds have also suffered particular injuries.  I remind the House that a recent doping scandal involved greyhounds.  In its definition of &ldquo;animal welfare&rdquo;, the World Organisation for Animal Health states that &ldquo;an animal is in a good state of welfare if ... it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear and distress&rdquo;.  The Bill represents a declaration of open season for the hunting of hares, which have enough to deal with during the coursing season.  I have made my point about the importance of registration in the cases of the bird species that are covered by the Bill.  I will leave it at that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am certainly going to pick up from where Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan left off.  I hope it does not upset the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not upsetting me.  It is a question of what is in the rules.  You can only speak to what is contained in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said, the purpose of this Bill is to allow somebody with a hunting licence issued after 1 August 2009 to carry on shooting wild birds and hares in the relevant open season.  That is what it is about.  It brings the issue of the welfare of hares to the forefront.  It invites us to consider whether it is appropriate to treat them in this way.  I totally agree with what Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said when she spoke about the shooting of wild birds.  The importance of the conservation of certain species of birds must be adhered to.  It is appropriate for Deputies to ask what the hare has ever done to the Irish Parliament.  The Bill we are discussing, which is being fast-tracked, will allow wild birds and hares to be shot.</P>
        <P>This House has not yet been given an opportunity to debate a large and important Bill that has been published.  The legislation in question &mdash; the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 &mdash; is being introduced to protect animals from cruelty and unnecessary suffering.  That vital Bill is being delayed but the Bill before the House is being fast-tracked.  It is appropriate to link the two.  The Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 talks about the prohibition of terrifying or baiting an animal.  It goes on to exempt hare coursing.  One Bill acknowledges that hare coursing is cruel by putting in an exemption for hares.  Hares are exempt from protection in one Bill and are included in this Bill to allow them to be shot, presumably over the course of the next few months, in case some of them got away or something like that.  I do not really know what the agenda is.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate to say that this barbarity must stop.  What did the hare ever do?  We are talking about making provision for licences to allow people to shoot this unique animal &mdash; an endemic sub-species that is not found anywhere else in the world &mdash; in the open season.  I am suggesting that other forms of treatment of this species, such as hare coursing activity, are relevant in this context.  We have allowed this activity to continue for more than 100 years while other jurisdictions have been criminalising it.  Hare coursing was appropriately outlawed in New South Wales in 1953, in New Zealand in 1954, in Victoria in 1964, in South Australia in 1985, in Scotland in 2002, in England and Wales in 2005 and in Northern Ireland in 2010.  These jurisdictions have criminalised hare coursing &mdash; it is treated as a criminal offence &mdash; but this country is carrying on regardless by allowing hares to be treated in a totally inappropriate manner.  It is scandalous that this activity continues regularly in ten counties: Clare, Kerry, Cork, Kilkenny, Donegal, Tipperary, Wexford, Limerick, Galway and Dublin.  Balbriggan, in my own constituency, is the only place in County Dublin where it is allowed to take place.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate to draw attention to this matter.  The Irish Coursing Club has said that hares come to no harm in coursing because they are protected by the existing rules governing the sport, as the club calls it.  That is completely and utterly false.  It does not stand up to any scrutiny of the evidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already ruled that Deputies are only entitled to speak on what is in the Bill.  I had to correct Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I am only applying the rules of the House.  This is not about coursing.  It is about extending the period during which the shooting of certain types of animals may take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with coursing.  Please stick to what is in the Bill.  Thank you.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  Fair enough.  I imagine we will have an interesting commentary from yourself when we get to the actual coursing Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I do not have a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, you have an opinion on the matter all right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me.  Withdraw that remark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay, you do not then.  I do not know what your opinion is on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  I am saying that in my opinion, the comments I am making are relevant because we are talking about allowing people with hunting licences to go out and shoot hares for five months of the year whereas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  That is it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for 12 months of the year, we are allowing hares to be used in a coursing environment.  We have to see it in the context of the protection of this species.  I would like to mention some of the commentary that has been made by the Irish Wildlife Trust, which is the foremost authority on this subject.  It is a conservation organisation that uses all the relevant scientific data and expertise on the status of the Irish hare population.  Some of its members are experts on this species.  The Irish Wildlife Trust has said that the hare on this island is an endemic sub-species.  In other words, it is not found anywhere else in the world.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has assessed the conservation of the hare, on the basis of recent studies, and expressed some concerns.  It has suggested that the population is stable but is subject to important fluxes.  A species action plan for the Irish hare, which was published by the same organisation, states that hare populations have undergone a substantial decline in the past 15 to 20 years and are thought to have fallen to a critical level in some areas.  There is concern about the conservation of hares.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The Irish Wildlife Trust has suggested in one of its reports that the unsustainable taking of hares for sporting purposes could be one of the reasons the species is threatened and in decline.  It is obvious that this extension of hunting licences, to allow some more hares to be shot, will pose a further threat to the species as a whole.  The trust believes this important species needs to be protected.  It is afforded protection under the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended in 2000, and under the EU habitats directive.  Additional measures need to be put in place to protect the hare.  It is relevant to examine this issue in its entirety.  The Government has been incredibly slow to introduce legislation to protect animals from cruelty.  However, it has found time to fast-track this measure, which will result in more hares being shot.  It is particularly reprehensible that we are doing this at the moment.  Other Deputies have made the point that shooting animals and wildlife, including birds, is good for tourism.  I suggest the opposite argument can be made.  Bird-watching and similar activities are also very important for local tourism.  If we prevent wild birds from being shot, it will be good for the economy.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for this Bill to extend current legislative provisions in this way.  I do not think we should take part in it.  I do not agree with the Bill for those reasons.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy Tom Barry.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important legislation.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010 includes provisions allowing all holders of valid firearm certificates issued for shotguns between 1 August 2009 and 31 July 2012 to be deemed to be the holders of a hunting licence under the Wildlife Acts for the purposes of hunting game bird and hare species.  This provision was introduced to address an issue that arose following the introduction of a new computerised firearm licensing system by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The solution proposed is a commonsense approach and will facilitate legal hunting by citizens of this State.  The legislation is necessary to allow people to continue lawful activities.  Throughout my constituency of Louth, there are strong and law-abiding gun clubs.  Gun clubs in rural areas like Stabannon and Tallanstown have a strong bond with and are respectful of nature.  I welcome anyone to accompany me through these beautiful areas of mid-Louth to sample the depth of tradition that permeates them.  It is a traditional skilled activity that has been handed down for generations.  It is important for my rural constituents to have their traditions respected and honoured.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010, the Wildlife Acts required a hunter to have a licence to hunt certain game birds, such as pheasant and partridge, and hares.  The Acts provided that this would be obtained as an endorsement on the hunter&rsquo;s firearm certificate.  The hunting licence and firearm certificate were issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the form of a shotgun licence.  The Bill will enable citizens to hunt in a lawful manner, otherwise they would be hunting unlawfully after 31 July.  This would not be acceptable, as the good citizens of Ireland who have complied with the law and respected nature cannot be allowed suddenly to become unlawful citizens.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not give hunters unrestricted permission to hunt protected birds and hares on a year-round basis.  The hunting season for game birds under the open season is restricted for most wildfowl to 1 September to the end of January.  In the case of popular game birds, such as pheasant and partridge, the open season is shorter, from 1 November to the end of January.  The open season for hares is from the end of September to the end of February.  These traditional dates are sacrosanct and will not be modified.  The Bill will allow hunters to continue their sporting activity in a legal manner without interruption during the open seasons.  As a consequence, I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill, which clarifies a situation that needs to be rectified.  The introduction of the new gun licence was welcome at the time.  Perhaps the licence should include a photograph, a signature and biometric data.  I also welcome the security measures and the policing and advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to firearms in houses.  Given the level of crime, it is important that measures are taken to ensure legal firearms do not stray into the wrong hands.  Gun safes are very welcome.</P>
        <P>As a person who shoots game and then uses it, shooting and game are part of the countryside and will remain so.  I disagree fundamentally with people who say we should not shoot game.  Another issue is the control of crows and pigeons.  Certain Deputies may say the shooting of any wild bird is wrong and that birdwatching is important but if they come to my part of the country they can watch thousands of wild birds destroying crops and passing on salmonella.  The control of wild birds through seed dressing has been prevented because we cannot use seed dressing on grain.  I am not a great lover of poison but in cases where there is a huge number of birds they need to be controlled and alpha-chloralose, the main poison, has a place when used in a regulated and trained fashion.  The cost of production to the countryside needs to be recognised.  With the bad weather at the moment, the number of pigeons and crows is frightening.</P>
        <P>I met a tillage group in my constituency on Monday and its members raised another issue in respect of this Bill.  We are having a problem because we cannot cut hedges on the sides of local roads, regional roads and national secondary roads.  Birds are nesting there but we must have the safety of users recognised because one cannot get up and down the roads.  Farmers are afraid to deal with the problem because, if they do, they are afraid they will be in breach of some law.  We must examine this carefully for the safety of people on the roads.  Farmers are willing to cut hedges themselves and bear the cost of it, which would help our tourism industry.  In discussing wildlife, this issue comes into play.</P>
        <P>An earlier speaker asked what the hares ever did to us.  They have done a lot of damage when there are excess numbers of them.  In my area, the number of hares is not at a critical level.  There is an abundance of them and there are two or three in my garden.  They are well able to cause damage.  I do not want to give the idea that gun clubs are not responsible.  They are incredibly responsible.  For people who preach from the middle of Dublin city, the reason the countryside is in such fine fettle is because the custodians of the countryside have maintained it like that for many years and continue to do so.  Less criticism and more help would be very welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill and I compliment the Government on bringing it forward.  When will legislation to reintroduce stag hunting be published?  It was promised in the general election.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, is not responsible for this area but the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, made many wild promises about it.  I hope this point is seriously considered because we must have a reasoned debate on these issues.  Many of these practices have been going on since time immemorial and are part and parcel of our life, heritage and culture.  Some 100 years ago, many people were sustained by eating these wildlife creatures after they were shot or fished.  People had little other food to eat.</P>
        <P>Other speakers, who are members of the Technical Group, are put on notice that I am totally supportive of the practice of coursing.  We are not talking about coursing, as such, but we are waiting to see when it will be introduced in the next Bill.  We are talking about simplifying a situation that became a problem.  The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for an extension of the current hunting licence provisions in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2010, which allows a hunter in possession of a firearm certificate for a shotgun to shoot wild birds and hares in open season.  The enactment of the Bill by 31 July 2012 will have no financial implications or cost for the Exchequer.  Some of my erstwhile friends in the Technical Group should think about this.  On a daily basis, they complain about unemployment, people emigrating and industry closing.  The next time there is a meeting of the think tank, it should come to Tipperary to the Golden Vale and I will take them on a tour of the sights.  There are some very well developed fishing and gun clubs and we can show them what goes on behind it.  None of us has infinite wisdom but I am often criticised for talking about something with which I am not familiar.  I would hate to talk about destroying employment on one hand and scream for more jobs on the other hand.  Other Members are advocating paying no taxes &mdash; whether the household tax or other taxes &mdash; and they bring opprobrium on us all regarding the expenses regime when they are advocating it.  We need some balance on this matter.</P>
        <P>I am all for sustainable rural communities.  There is no better way to sustain them than to have good practice in farming.  Fortunately, we have very good practice in the main, following the introduction of REPS and many other schemes over the years.  Successive Ministers have done good work in this regard.  The farming community itself has made great efforts, as can be seen in the engagement by various farming organisations, including the Irish Farmers Association, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the sheep breeders and hill sheep breeders associations.  It is vital that these changes are made and I compliment the Minister on doing what had to be done.  There were anomalies in the existing legislation which had to be resolved.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to obtain a gun licence for shooting game unless one has land or designated access to land as agreed with the farmer or landowner.  It is all about protecting farming.  This year we have had appalling weather right through the spring and now into mid-summer and harvest time.  Leaving Tipperary this morning, I saw that the barley and wheat are beginning to be stretched with the heavy rains.  Those crops survived the rain in June because they did not yet have heavy heads, but they are now dropping and are vulnerable to flocks of crows and pigeons.  If not for the shotgun and the people willing to take the necessary action, farmers would be cleaned out.  It is as simple as that.  I do not want to besmirch the name of the late Tony Gregory, a person whose achievements I acknowledge.  However, living in a city, the only crow one might see is the one landing in Croke Park when the game is over.  This is not aimed at Tony Gregory himself, God rest him, but at his colleagues.</P>
        <P>People must try to understand rural life, where the milk comes from and the barley and wheat for our bread.  People sometimes do not care to know where the food they eat comes from.  We are an agricultural producing country with huge potential.  We cannot bring in law after law merely to suit those who live inside the Pale, some of whom are not interested in our nature or heritage.  People should go on a heritage and wildlife tour to enjoy the beautiful scenery, environment and landscapes in rural areas, the crops of rapeseed and corn which are now turning in the golden sunshine.  One would not see it in any other part of the world.  Everybody has an obligation to educate themselves.  I acknowledge that I have much to learn about city life, but I am not coming up to this city telling the people who live here that they cannot do this, that and the other.  We have enough of that in the countryside.</P>
        <P>In regard to hare coursing, Clonmel coursing festival is worth &euro;6 million to the region.  It is maintaining jobs in many small industries.  People are living in cuckoo land when they ask what hares ever did to anybody to deserve such treatment.  Hares are, in the main, nurtured and cared for and the dogs are muzzled.  Practices in coursing have, in almost every case, been transformed so that everybody can now enjoy a safe and dignified sporting occasion.  The Minister is welcome to come to Clonmel at any time.  Beidh f&iacute;or f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; Cluain Meala an bhliain seo chugainn.  I recall a story I heard about Hugh Leonard &mdash; I am not sure whether he is still alive, but I hope he is.  There is a story of the treatment he got from a certain publican called Mrs. Keogh when he came to Clonmel one day and wanted dinner.  When he said he was anti-coursing, he got a bucket of water on his head and was gone in a flash.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile.</P>
        <P>I am sick, sore and tired of receiving abusive e-mails from animal rights organisations, with their talk of cruelties, which clog up the system on a regular basis.  These are the same people who came to Clonmel greyhound track on several occasions before a coursing festival and stuck broken bottles and glasses into the ground in order to prevent the event proceeding.  There was no consideration for the cruelty this would inflict on the greyhounds and hares if their paws were injured on the glass.  These people are sick.  I would not like to say they are deranged, but they are definitely very sick.  I saw a letter written by some of their number to a former Member of this House &mdash; a Deputy from my area &mdash; indicating what they would do his children.  Let us get our principles half right here.  In the debate on stag-hunting two years ago, there was an argument that horse racing should be outlawed because it involves pitting one animal against another.  These are the people did not want sheepdogs assisting in the rounding up of sheep and cattle.  Are farmers supposed to use a helicopter?  They were opposed to live exports of cattle.  They want us to forget about the rest of the world and be self-sufficient, yet we cannot eat fish or kill animals.  Are we supposed to become cannibals and eat each other?  I am not trying to be funny here.  These people must get real and understand the realities of rural life and that many aspects of urban life depend on rural activities.</P>

	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not here when my erstwhile colleagues were condemning all of this and seeking the banning of all and sundry.  Thankfully, we did not, cannot and will not succumb to those demands.</P>
        <P>Outstanding work is carried out in rural areas by local gun clubs and fishing clubs, the IFA and other farming organisations, and by farming families themselves.  It is a joint effort.  Just because one stag appeared in a school one day, which is obviously dangerous, we should not throw out the baby &mdash; indeed, the whole family &mdash; with the bath water.  Instead, we must encourage and support these clubs in the valuable work they are doing.  I made the same point to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, in recent debates on another issue.  I probably should not mention that Minister&rsquo;s name in this debate.  The animals would avoid him in any case, although it would be good to put him in there with them because it would stimulate the growth of bacteria better than any pureflow system or any other system that is being promoted.  The people I am talking about work on the mountains with their bare hands, burning off gorse carefully and with the conscientious support of the Irish Wildlife Trust.  They do more than anybody else to promote, stimulate, restock and protect their environment.  We have seen the figures in regard to the value for tourism of one fish that is caught in Ireland.  We are talking about sustainable communities.  Farming was doing well this year until the inclement weather was sent by the man above.  One would not wonder at the latter being confused by the messages he is getting from people who despite claiming to be hungry and badly off, do not want to allow us to partake in our recreational activities or to eat venison or whatever meat we prefer.  It is not surprising that we are all confused.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, did a walk recently in Tipperary where he enjoyed beautiful sunshine and the views from Aherlow.  Perhaps he will consider coming down to visit the ABGN gun club and the other gun clubs in south Tipperary, all of which do outstanding work.  They deserve accolades for their efforts in preserving their environment and teaching young people right from wrong when it comes to protecting the landscape and its inhabitants.  I have a gun licence to shoot fowl but I never shot a hare in my life.  I would not do so.  However, crows and pigeons must be shot.  Grey crows too will destroy a lamb flock if they get the chance.  We must accept the realities and get real.  Gun clubs, fishing clubs and angling clubs should be supported in continuing their important work.  It is their members who have to deal with the damage done to the environment by municipal plants, some of which continue to malfunction even after millions are spent on their repair.  When they emit foul odours and massive leakages into the rivers, it is the people I am talking about who report the matter to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA staff member, unfortunately, may well do no more than telephone a contact in the local authority to say that the same fellow is complaining again and ask that the offender be spoken to, yet ordinary people will be hauled before the courts if they cannot afford to upgrade their septic tanks.  Fishing clubs and gun clubs are doing a great deal to nurture the environment but they are not getting the support they deserve.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive register of greyhound tracks is now in place, managed by the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not sure whether it is independently monitored, but I assume it is.  I ask my colleagues, Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan and Clare Daly, to come down to Clonmel and see the coursing for themselves.  They should educate themselves on what goes on both on and off the track.  We will go down to Annie Keogh&rsquo;s for our dinner and have a healthy chat about it.  We must support all efforts to keep what we have in rural Ireland because we have so little.</P>
        <P>This week, I have been listening to Cian McCormack&rsquo;s tremendous daily reports on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; where he visits various towns in rural areas.  Listeners to the programme hear about the enthusiasm, fight and stamina of business owners and ordinary people as they promote their towns and create new ways of getting people to spend in their communities.  What better way to attract people to rural areas than to encourage coursing meetings, horse races and fishing?  Unfortunately, in the case of my local angling club in Newcastle, wealthy entrepreneurs have bought up the fishing rights and local people are denied access to the river.  While I do not like to describe him as &ldquo;trigger-happy&rdquo;, our local ranger believes he is Kelly the boy from Killane.  If a buachaill &oacute;g n&oacute; cail&iacute;n &oacute;g fishes from the bridge in the village, which was mined during the troubles, the Garda is called to arrest him or her.  I did not know it was illegal to fish from a bridge crossing the River Suir but the local ranger believes he can put anyone off it.  What better pastime is available to young people than to learn how to fish?  I am a bad hand at fishing, having failed to learn, but my son is learning to fish.  In any case, it is almost impossible to fish this year with the floodwaters.</P>
        <P>People wish to enjoy themselves within the law, promote our culture and heritage and avail of our natural resources which we have had since time immemorial.  Long may we be allowed to engage sensibly in such activities.  While some people will always engage in lamping or poaching, which are practices I do not condone, I support right-thinking people who want to promote and stimulate the activities I have described.  Is it not better for a young boy or girl to be outside fishing or hunting than sitting at home every day in front of computer on Facebook, Google or whatever else?  At least when they return to school after the summer, their teachers can ask them about flora, fauna and mother nature, about which I learned when I went coursing as a buachaill &oacute;g with the men of the parish.  Coursing was good, healthy exercise and all I had was the butt of a stick to hit a ditch.</P>
        <P>A previous speaker referred to the herding of hares.  I herd in sheep with a sheepdog at weekends and others herd cattle, goats and even deer.  How would we manage livestock if we were not able to herd them with the assistance of a dog?  It was suggested we behave like fierce wild beasts as we jump down ditches with electronic weapons hunting unfortunate hares and herding them into corralled areas.  Last year, I discussed coursing with an animal rights activist on my local radio station.  Animal rights activists had cut nets and allowed hares to escape two nights before the Clonmel coursing event.  The hares escaped over a fence and ran onto the M8 motorway where they were slaughtered.  It is illogical for an activist to argue that this is more humane, normal and natural than hares being chased by a dog.  When the activist in question was asked whether he had ever stepped on a snail or slug when walking on land, he could not answer the question.  We must understand there is human and animal life.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to a writer who referred to people in Soho.  We saw how things can go badly wrong at a recent event in the Phoenix Park when there were few animals around.  Those who attended the event would benefit from an understanding of nature, where we came from and how to behave.  Farmers and others involved with wildlife treat animals with respect and are very strict in this regard.  They give a good education to young people who join various clubs.  In south County Tipperary they also promote tourism and business and help maintain a vibrant community.  They are involved in many good projects, including some supported by the Tipperary Leader programme.  Knockmealdown Active, for example, is a new organisation which does tremendous work to promote and enhance tourism, industry and business.</P>
        <P>Money does not come from holes in walls, cheques in the post or social welfare offices but must be generated through farm production and other means.  I have had many a good dinner from a rabbit I killed and skinned.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle hunted rabbits when he was young.  This is healthy exercise.  Legislation on the minimum working age and other baloney introduced in recent years prevents young people from working.  We have changed for the worse in many respects.  While many of the measures introduced were well-intentioned, unfortunately we are moving backwards.  It is good for townspeople to spend time outdoors, helping farmers and learning about nature and for country people to give a hand in pubs and shops where they can learn to deal with customers and come to understand the value of commerce and trade.  We need to be careful not to regulate everything or we may all end up stuck in armchairs in front of the television.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to ensure the solemn promise to reintroduce stag hunting, which was made by some of his colleagues before the general election, is kept.  I do not know anything about stag hunting, having never taken part in the pastime, but it used to be a valuable industry which had a number of spin-off activities.  It is not an especially cruel activity and it continues to take place despite the ban.</P>
        <P>The promotion of the Irish language was discussed earlier.  As I have argued for years, if Irish were banned, everyone would speak it daily.  We are banning too many things.  It is often said that we are losing our sovereignty.  We lost most of our sovereignty a long time ago and the laws being introduced are eroding it further.  The Croppies must lie down and we must become beholden again to other people and agents, whether wildlife officials, fisheries officers or others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions, which were varied but constructive overall.  To respond to Deputy Troy, only those people with firearms certificates for a shotgun are covered by this Bill and the review of the wildlife Acts will include a review of all aspects of licensing.  The Deputy expressed concern at the small number of Bills emanating from my Department and argued that this legislation should have been introduced more speedily.  Little has been done in this area since the previous wildlife Act was introduced 40 years ago.  I have given a commitment under the national biodiversity plan to review the wildlife Acts.  This process will require considerable consultation and I hope a Bill will be introduced by 2014.  It would be a good outcome if we could stick to that timeframe.</P>
        <P>Two Bills from my Department are before the House today, namely, the Bill before us and the Gaeltacht Bill being taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley.  Next year, I hope to introduce a monuments Bill, which will be wide-ranging and ground-breaking legislation.  My Department has been active in the area of legislation.</P>
        <P>Deputy John Browne noted that the current legislation was introduced almost 40 years ago.  It is important to update the legislation and, in doing so, to consult widely.  The consultation process has commenced and I have regular meetings with representatives of the relevant organisations, for example, Des Crofton of the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  As I stated, 2014 is not far away.</P>
        <P>On the issuing of farm certificates, Deputy Browne may not be aware that this is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Licences are not required to shoot rabbits or foxes.  The Bill refers only to the hunting of wild birds and hares.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputies Sandra McLellan and Michael Colreavy for expressing positive support for the Bill.  I concur with Deputy McLellan on the importance of preserving rural pastimes which, as well as social benefits, have significant economic benefits.  The relationship between the rural population, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and other agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland is vital.  I have said in meetings with environmentalists that the most important custodians of the environment are those who live in rural areas.  Unfortunately in the past, in many cases, urban dwellers dictated to them and while they had the best of intentions, they did not have to live in rural areas and did not understand what it was like to live in such places.  I am trying to get people to work together and it is happening to an extent.</P>
        <P>As regards the environment, I was in charge of the REPS in the mid-1990s and at the time there was a certain reluctance on the part of the farming organisations to embrace the concept of teh scheme, but their attitude has totally changed since and they have become positively disposed towards ensuring the environment is protected and that nature and biodiversity are safeguarded.  There has been a major reduction in the number of bees, which has resulted in their having to be imported to pollinate plants.  Farmers and other rural dwellers are aware that they must protect the rural environment.  If we can have a better relationship between people in the environmental pillar who are concerned about the environment for good reasons and those who are protecting the environment, farmers and the rural population, we can make progress.</P>
        <P>The project under way on Boleybrack Mountain is very interesting because there is concern about the red grouse population.  Red grouse have vanished from many parts of the countryside where once they were plentiful.  If I get the opportunity, I will be delighted to take Deputy Michael Colreavy up on his offer of a visit to County Leitrim to see the project.  I am aware there is another project in County Tipperary and similar projects elsewhere, but there is major concern about the red grouse and I would like to see how the project is being run in County Leitrim.  The community on Boleybrack Mountain has organised the project and I am pleased it was undertaken in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Unfortunately for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, it has become associated with telling people what not to do rather than what they can do in co-operation with it.  This is a good example of how working with the local community can have good results.</P>
        <P>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan has continued the work undertaken by the late Tony Gregory to whom I spoke many times in this House and beyond about coursing.  The motion on coursing that he tabled in 1993 was interesting; it split a number of parties, my own included.  I take some credit, however, for the achievement of muzzling.  I proposed the measure in a debate during Private Members&rsquo; business and it was adopted by the Government.  I said then that it took the blood out of coursing, although there are still issues to be resolved.  Wherever there is coursing, there will be hares.  I attend the occasional coursing meeting, although I have not been at one for over a year, and it is very much part of the rural way of life and its culture.  Some Deputies might criticise this, but where I come from in north Kerry coursing is as popular as Gaelic football.  It commands a huge following and without it people would feel a major emptiness in their lives.  One of their pastimes and real interests would be no more and it would have a real effect on them.</P>
        <P>As regards monitoring coursing meetings, the National Parks and Wildlife Service reports on coursing meetings and wildlife rangers are present.  They report back to me on the issues of hare husbandry and health and how the local coursing clubs look after the hares, both in captivity and the wild.  Many hare coursing clubs protect hare habitats and ensure hares are protected.</P>
        <P>As very few people shoot hares, these measures will be part of the review of the Bill.  I said to the coursing community that I was thinking of removing the reference to hares from the Bill because very few people shot them.  The only reason the reference to them was included in the first instance was for control, where there might be a huge hare population in a particular place.  That certainly could pose a threat to crops.  However, I do not know of anyone who shoots hares, but the provision was included in the legislation; therefore, if it is not needed, I see no reason, when we review the legislation, we should not reconsider its inclusion.</P>
        <P>Bag returns were mentioned.  Those involved have some arrangement, but it is not obligatory to report bag catches.  This is another issue we must examine in the future.</P>
        <P>Deputy Clare Daly was exercised about hare coursing also.  I understand the Technical Group proposes to introduce a Bill on this issue which would give the Deputy an opportunity to discuss it.  It is up to the Technical Group to allow for this when it has time to do so in the future.</P>
        <P>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick highlighted the importance of tourism, while Deputy Tom Barry has some practical knowledge as a man involved in farming and the grain business.  He knows about bird control and mentioned crows and pigeons.  If there is no control, considerable damage can be done to crops, leading to a major loss of farming income.  There is no doubt about that and that is why it is important to have these controls.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath raised several issues.  I agree fully with him that local gun and coursing clubs are important for the preservation of wildlife in the country.  It is important that the environmental groups work closely with the gun clubs and coursing clubs because they share a common interest in the preservation of wildlife in the country.  If they work together these groups could get better results.  Deputy McGrath referred to a specific issue about fishing clubs.  I do not have responsibility for that area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has responsibility for inland fisheries and Deputy McGrath should raise that issue with him.</P>
        <P>I thank the various Deputies for their contributions.  There will be further debate on this issue in time to come.  I would like to proceed to the next Stage.</P>

    <Title>Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>One must consider where the weight of this Bill lies.  I realise that the intention of all elements of the Government in respect of this Bill is to sort out a problem not of its making.  Naturally, the instinct of every Member is to support a Bill of this sort because of the terrible situation in which many people find themselves, especially in respect of their mortgages.  However, ultimately one must consider where the balance lies in the Bill, whether it is in favour of the lender or the borrower, or whether it represents a middle road.  I contend that upon examination the weight and power of the Bill are installed on the side of the lender.  One should not put a parasite in poll position when one has a problem of this sort to resolve.</P>
        <P>The problem with the Bill is not the intent, it is not the solutions suggested, it is not the proposed insolvency body and it is not the intermediaries.  It is the fact that ultimately the power lies in one place, the place where it has always been in Ireland.  Even recently we have learned no lessons in this regard.  The banks will hold the final say and they will hold a veto on people who are stuck with mortgages they cannot pay off.</P>
        <P>This Bill was an ideal opportunity for the Government to break the power of the banks.  The banks are as responsible as those who have borrowed for the situation in which we find ourselves and are as responsible for the necessity of this Bill.  Why is it that, having started off with such great intentions, the final result from the Government is that the banks decide on the package for the person who has borrowed?  There is an option, however.</P>

	<P>The borrower could opt for insolvency.  In other words the borrowers could opt to take a suicide bomb, a grenade and the pin.  It is suggested that they have the options to go ahead if they do not like what the bank has decided.  They could take the intermediaries out of the picture and blow themselves up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>They could opt not to accept this.  At this stage, the borrower will take the option which the Government has handed him or her, which is to destroy himself or herself in the process.  That is the ultimate weapon the borrower has.  The Bill is disappointing.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the intent behind the Bill.  They genuinely would like to sort out the problem.  The difficulty is that the Government, like every other Government, has been captured by the bank lobby and the bankers got the result they wanted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  Much of the debate since the financial crash in 2008 has revolved around sovereign debt, bondholders, reckless bankers, bank guarantees, etc., but the impact of all that is what we are discussing in this Bill, that is, the thousands of families that have been affected by personal debt.</P>
        <P>The recession in the 1980s and early 1990s consisted mainly of sovereign debt.  In that period, banks were more responsible and people were more cautious, but at the height of the Celtic tiger era, when there was probably a letter a week coming from the financial institutions dropping through the letterboxes of the public offering massive sums of money with little security, and in some cases even suggesting the properties that should be invested in, 100% mortgages were the order of the day.  Not only was the price of the house given, but so too was that of the landscaping, the 4X4s and the furniture.  A culture grew up in which ordinary people felt that they were not cool or were not part of modern society if they did not have a property portfolio.  Unfortunately, many innocent people bought into bad advice and now must live with the consequences, and this Bill is about living with those consequences.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the Bill and the Minister&rsquo;s attempts to address what is an urgent and complex issue.  No Bill will solve the problems overnight.  There is no silver bullet.  The clock cannot be turned back on this issue and the problem must be met head on, and that is what this Bill does.</P>
        <P>There has been criticism &mdash; Deputy Ross continued it &mdash; that the bank or lender still holds a veto and the balance of power.  I was surprised last week when I went to a briefing by FLAC and other non-governmental organisations where some of them were suggesting this Bill is unworkable, something with which I would not agree on studying it.  I was taken aback by some of the suggestions being made.  The Government has faced up to what is a mammoth and complex task and is putting a structure in place that will not solve everybody&rsquo;s problem but at least will give a chance to thousands of people to have a normal life again and to have a secure home to live in.</P>
        <P>I would have a number of concerns and I want to highlight them briefly in my contribution.  One, which was highlighted last week by Deputy Durkan, is the imposition of penalties and compound interest which, if extracted to the full, will completely bury thousands of people.  I strongly suggest these should not be the tipping point to put people over the cliff.  Thousands of people are struggling valiantly and keeping up their interest payments, and they should not be pushed over the limit with these extra penalties.</P>
        <P>I want also to raise the plight of those who have an adverse credit rating with the Irish Credit Bureau as they cannot now borrow for their daily needs, get a credit card or even open a bank account.  Typically, these are self-employed business persons or employees of companies or of the State who bought investment properties in the past ten years.  They invested much of their savings as deposits and borrowed the balance from the bank, or offered their own home as security and borrowed the full property cost from their banks.  They were encouraged to do so by the property sellers and by the readily available credit from the banks.  They may have purchased houses, apartments or holidays, but these were effectively a pension for the future of these people.  Their intention in buying them was to generate some wealth for their old age or for their children.  There were thousands of them.  They were not speculators, developers or gamblers, but they now find themselves in arrears with their loan commitments to their banks because their business incomes or salaries have fallen and their rental incomes have fallen or reduced substantially.  They fully intend to repay all their debts, even if it will take a longer period, but they are now much less well off and have a much reduced standard of living, and they are coming to grips with that.  If they have other assets, they will sell them, often at a reduced value as that is the only way to offload them at present, merely to generate funds to reduce their banking liabilities.  They are now left unhappy that their noble intentions are not recognised or reciprocated by the financial institutions.  They cannot continue to live their lives as before because of their adverse credit ratings.  With the loans being in arrears, their credit rating is affected.  They cannot borrow from the bank to replace the family car, send their children to college, or fund weddings or funerals.  Even if they clear their debt entirely, their adverse credit rating will remain with them for a further five years.</P>
        <P>There is nothing in this Bill to help these people and I suggest an amendment should be made to it to address the adverse rating of these ordinary and genuine people who find themselves in this position for the first time in their lives.  Their ability to use the borrowing facilities of the banks also affects the level of spending in the economy and frustrates the small and medium-sized business sector&rsquo;s efforts to grow again.  The authorised debt adviser or personal insolvency practitioner roles, as outlined in the Bill, do not address their situation because they continue to work and generate income which they are using to repay their debt.  They are the ignored victims of this banking crisis who deserve some recognition and support in their efforts to regulate their affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also glad to have the opportunity to raise a few points on the Personal Insolvency Bill.  I welcome the legislation and the efforts of the Minister and his officials in drafting it.</P>
        <P>I heard much of the debate heretofore.  There has been criticism that the Bill was slow in arriving.  The nature of this legislation is such that it was bound to be difficult to draft.  On the areas it reforms, some of the laws governing the areas of bankruptcy and insolvency predate the State and are certainly complex to resolve.</P>
        <P>As a public representative, I am sure I am only one of 166 in this Chamber who have met constituents who find themselves in difficult financial situations arising out of the country&rsquo;s recent economic difficulties.  In fact, in the year and a bit since I have become a Member, I have found it difficult to deal with the stressful situations in which these individuals and families find themselves.  It is one of the aspects of being a public representative that one finds oneself from time to time having to act in the role of a counsellor who gives advice.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have been struck by the number of couples and individuals who have come to my office and clinics moved to the point of tears and very frightened for their futures because of an inability to pay mortgage repayments, in particular, but also other debts.  This is why I welcome the Bill, which completely transforms the systems that are currently in place with regard to resolving financial difficulties that families and individuals face.  Much of the legislation is completely new.  It contains proposals to reform the existing structures on bankruptcy, which is certainly long overdue and welcome, but it also sets out a whole new process of debt reconciliation which, if it is passed, will become the normal practice.</P>
        <P>I want to ask the Minister about certain aspects of the Bill but I also want to acknowledge the difficult balancing act which he is trying to achieve.  I have heard several Opposition speakers, both in the past and during this debate, suggest there is no bailout for individuals and families whereas there is a bailout for banks.  In fact, the difficult balancing act in this legislation is between those people who are in financial distress and cannot legitimately meet their debts and those who might choose not to meet their debts.  The fact is that in a situation where the State is a creditor and is now the major shareholder in many of our financial institutions, the writing off of debt has a direct impact on everyone.  There can be no situation where there is an open chequebook for people who are in a position to meet their debt repayments in order to escape the legitimate charges they face.  This legislation manges to strike that balance between those people who genuinely cannot pay and those who are opportunistically trying to avoid payment.  In that regard, I welcome it.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy Ross&rsquo;s contributions to the debate a few days ago and again today.  I point out that a significant number of creditors are not banks.  It is equally important to state that not all mortgages entered into were bad arrangements and many were legitimately entered into by people at the time, although their circumstances may have changed.  None the less, this does not mean people who entered into a mortgage can expect in the future to abrogate their responsibilities and they have a responsibility to live up to their mortgages.  I myself am a mortgage holder and I know the difficulties that are attached to that.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that some of the heaviest criticism of this Bill was from the Irish Banking Federation, which was not happy with the Minister&rsquo;s upper limit on personal insolvency arrangements, which I understand is &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony in regard to some of the bad practices that crept into our banks in the past ten years in particular, an issue I raised as a Member of the other House.  There was a period from, say, 2004 to 2008, where every four to six months I would personally receive a letter from my financial institution offering me &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 in an unsecured personal loan.  I am sure many thousands of other customers of that institution used to get similar letters and I am sure many took up these opportunities for loans at the time.  It is fair to say the financial institutions carry a large responsibility for those types of personal loan arrangements that people took on despite this money being unsolicited by the consumer.  The banks cannot walk away from their responsibility in offering such facilities to their customers.  I also agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony in regard to the point made by Deputy Durkan last week on penalties, compound interest and the possibility of putting people in even more difficult situations into the future.</P>
        <P>One of the aspects of this legislation that is long overdue is the reform of the terms of bankruptcy.  The attitude to bankruptcy is an issue that is particular to Ireland and perhaps the neighbouring island.  Like many other Members, I have a significant number of family members, cousins and other relatives who live across the Atlantic in the United States.  I was speaking recently to a second cousin who is in his second incarnation as a restaurateur in Florida, where he has a series of restaurants, although he went bankrupt in his previous existence as a restaurateur some ten years ago.  There is a completely different attitude to bankruptcy in the United States which means that, if people fail and make an honest effort to repay and meet their debts, they are allowed to recover, get back into business and continue to have a life and prospects into the future.  In this country, the old system of keeping people out of business for 12 years acted as a disincentive for people to get involved in business and was outdated, to say the least.  This is why I welcome the fact this new three year provision is included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the new personal insolvency practitioners who are designated under the Bill, what type of individual does the Minister foresee filling these particularly important functions?  These are the people who will be charged with drafting the settlement arrangements that are referred to in the legislation, which is a very important role as these people will bring forward the arrangements which will be voted on by creditors.  I point out to Senator Ross that a veto is not just available to creditors but also to debtors, who will have the opportunity not to accept what is proposed by the personal insolvency practitioner.</P>
        <P>I would like to ensure the fees that are charged by such practitioners are not exorbitant.  Obviously, the people who are seeking to avail of the services of such practitioners are not in a position to pay huge fees for the service provided, and it would be important the provision of this service is not hugely costly in itself.</P>
        <P>Those are the issues I wished to raise apart from those raised by other speakers.  I welcome the introduction of the legislation and congratulate the Minister, who is by far the busiest member of the Government in terms of legislation within this area.  This substantial legislation promises to overhaul completely the insolvency laws in this country and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>Any measure which can bring relief to people who have found themselves in an impossible position because of mounting debts and reduced capacity to pay is progressive.  However, there are a number of elements in the Bill which must be amended if we are to put in place measures effective enough to move away from our punitive way of dealing with debt and give people the opportunity of a fresh start in life.</P>
        <P>The latest figures indicate that 79,712 mortgages are subject to restructuring plans while 961 homes were in the process of repossession in the first quarter of this year alone.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has estimated that 1.8 million people are left with less than &euro;100 a month to live on after paying essential bills.  These realities must be made clear to banks and mortgage providers.  It is the duty of the Government, and all of us as legislators, to force the State-owned banks to pass on any cuts in interest rates to help struggling mortgage holders.</P>
        <P>The fact that this legislation affords banks or other lenders a potential veto on any debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement will make the Bill meaningless to many people.  A submission on the Bill by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul confirmed that many of the households due to access the arrangements as proposed in the draft legislation already live on inadequate incomes and face considerable household budgeting pressure.  It is its view, and mine, that corrupt bankers destroyed this country and now they are being allowed to decide whether people can go bankrupt.  That is exactly what it means.  People feel utterly betrayed because the Government let the unsecured Irish bondholders write their own rules and now the banks are practically writing their own rules.  Nothing has changed, therefore, in the minds of hundreds of thousands of people who are dealing with banks and credit institutions across the country.  It would be morally wrong to allow this veto while the banks&rsquo; collection officers are going around the country shaming, harassing and intimidating unfortunate families out of their last few euro because their own underwriters recklessly dished out unsustainable and non-stress-tested, commission-driven loans.  My concern is that the new legislation will lead to more aggressive pursuit of householders in mortgage arrears by lending institutions.</P>
        <P>The Minister should be aware that this is happening.  I refer him to comments made last week by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who rightly stated that we cannot trust or believe the banks.  I am dealing with instances in which the banks are hounding people.  Is the Minister aware that they are ringing people after 9 p.m.?  Does he know that they are threatening and hounding people out of their homes?  The Minister should not let them tell him otherwise.  I outlined an instance in the House recently, which I will repeat.  A young girl finished her shift in a factory in Waterford at 8.30 a.m., following which she came into my office with her father.  As she was in arrears for two months &mdash; she had already taken a 30% cut in her income &mdash; the bank was threatening to repossess her house.  That did not happen four or five years ago; it happened last week.  People had better cop on that the banks and lending institutions are not listening to what the Minister is saying.  I know what I am talking about from the many bankers I know and my other connections.  They are making their representatives and the workers in the banks engage in such practices.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, this veto could result in lenders&rsquo; rejecting viable alternative arrangements in favour of more costly, court-based bankruptcy proceedings.  I am open to being proven wrong in that regard but in the next few years we will see what the banks intend to do about people in debt who are making honest efforts to repay their debts.  We will see if the banks continue to harass and threaten people and if the credit institutions continue to take people to court.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other flaws in the Bill, on which I wish to focus.  The one clear-cut benefit of the Bill is that people will be able to declare themselves insolvent after three years and the negative equity remaining after the repossession and disposal of their home will no longer hang over them.  I welcome that.  However, while the bankruptcy term will now be three years, the insolvency service or a creditor can then ask for a five-year income payment order to be implemented.  My interpretation, and that of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other groups, is that this will mean eight years of further austerity for someone already going bankrupt.  Somebody who bought a house for a huge sum of money in 2003 when he or she had a stable, well-paying job but then lost the job and now has no other prospect of covering the mortgage is already living in severe hardship.  Such people have seen the value of their houses cut almost in half, yet they are stuck with huge mortgages that are well out of whack, so to speak, with the real value, and this legislation will lock them into poverty for possibly another eight years.  That is my interpretation of it, and it is the interpretation of many groups outside the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>All of this is stacked in favour of the credit institutions and the banks, and that is fundamentally wrong.  An income payment order should run concurrently with the bankruptcy term at the very least.  Furthermore, there is no disincentive for a debtor to travel to the United Kingdom to declare bankruptcy.  The period for automatic discharge in the UK is up to 12 months, with a maximum three-year income payment order which runs concurrently from the date the bankruptcy is declared.</P>
        <P>To comprehensively protect mortgage debtors who may need to use the terms of this new legislation, the Government must outline clearly defined yet flexible social housing responses which can be offered at the same point as the insolvency provisions are enacted.  We should carefully consider that.  I urge the Minister to commit to putting aside a budget for an awareness campaign on the details of this Bill to make people who are desperately seeking a solution aware of their rights.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Government believes this Personal Insolvency Bill will help, and parts of it will help, but I make an appeal to the Minister based on the history of the banks up to last week and incidents involving people I am dealing with whose lives are in turmoil because of harassment by credit institutions and banks.  It does not matter what the Minister thinks or what the banks and credit institutions say to him.  I repeat what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated last week or the week before: we cannot trust the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who I understand is sharing time with Deputies Pat Breen and Anthony Lawlor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House before the summer recess.  It is an important Bill, and it is important that we get it right.  I often receive complaints about the length of time it takes to bring legislation before the House and see it through, and I have made such complaints, but when it comes to this legislation it is incredibly important that we take the required time to examine every detail of it because once we are finished with it, it is the law of the land.  We must be certain that the intended consequences of the Bill and what we want to achieve with it are realised in the real world, so to speak, when it is put into practice.  It is necessary, therefore, to have the many days of debate we have had to bring it to Committee Stage, where we will scrutinise every aspect of it, because once it leaves this House there is nothing more we can do with it.  It is then the law of the land.</P>
        <P>This is the fourth day of debate on the Bill but I regret that because of events this week and last week I have not been able to listen to all contributions.  As the Bill is so important I would like to have been present for all of the contributions, and I apologise if I go over ground that has been covered by previous speakers.  I would like to take up Deputy Phelan&rsquo;s point about the personal element of this for elected representatives.  It is not something I imagined I would be involved with when I was elected to Dublin City Council in 2009, but I would call to people&rsquo;s front doors and they would break down in tears in front of me.  People come into my office in Ranelagh to talk through their problems and are not able to finish because they are overwhelmed by emotion and the difficulties they are facing.  They then write to me because they are embarrassed that this has happened and apologise to me.  I then feel terrible embarrassment that they feel that way.  We are not trained to deal with these situations.  As Deputy John Paul Phelan said, we are elected as councillors and Deputies, but we are not trained as counsellors to deal with such difficult problems.  However, we are at the coalface because we are public representatives and because we were elected by the people, they come to us with a plethora of issues and problems.  While it is difficult for us, we can only imagine how difficult it must be for those facing a terrible debt burden and the effect it has on their lives and ability to be happy.</P>
        <P>I was lucky in that regard in that I was not in the country for the worst of the boom years between 2004 and 2008.  I did not take out a mortgage and while I have debt, I am just about managing it, unlike many of my friends and peers who are in difficult situations because they bought at the height of the boom and subsequently they or their partner lost their job.  All of a sudden their mortgage repayments began to look impossible and perhaps they were borrowing against the house for other things.  It might not have been wise, but they did it and are now are in difficult situations.  Young people of my age are looking ahead and finding it very difficult to see a future or their way out.  That is the type of situation we are trying to address.  The Bill is aimed at those who need help, have taken responsibility for their situation and now want to find a way out of it.  We must ensure we can provide a way out of their difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Bill concerns personal debt and insolvency, but the context in which we debate it is important because when we look at the national economic picture, the country is insolvent and currently in a deficit management arrangement.  In anticipation of the debate on the Bill I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, for information last week.  As part of an experiment, I asked him to divide the deficit and the general Government debt among the population.  He informed me of the following figures which are worth repeating in this context.  At the end of June the national debt stood at &euro;131.9 billion.  Given an estimated population of just under 4.6 million, an individual&rsquo;s share of the national debt outstanding at the end of June was just under &euro;28,750.  That is the figure for every single person in the State, as recorded in the census last year, not just those earning a wage.  If we look at the deficit for this year alone, it was estimated at &euro;18.655 billion.  Again, if we take the population to be 4.6 million, an individual&rsquo;s share of this year&rsquo;s Exchequer deficit is approximately &euro;4,065.  Again, that is the figure for every single person in the State, not just those earning a wage, and it is wholly separate from the banking debt and legacy debt; it is the figure for day-to-day borrowings for this year just to keep the show on the road.  Let us look at the issue in household terms.  If a person is working and he or she has a stay-at-home spouse and three dependants, it represents approximately &euro;20,000 in borrowings by that person for this year alone before he or she even begins to consider his or her own personal circumstances and the debts the family might have in terms of household bills, a failed business or difficult mortgage.  That is the situation facing the State and the context in which we are having the debate on the Bill.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for the Deputies concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a national debt and a deficit and the State must deal with it.  As individuals, we are responsible for it and will pay it off through taxes in the course of our lives, but it is not as immediately relevant as personal debt and what people face every day.  The Government will deal with the national finances, but people are struggling with their finances.  We know a significant amount is involved.  We must introduce legislation to allow some resolution because, as Deputy John Paul Phelan stated, the current system is outdated.  We know it is insufficient to deal with the problem.  People need to find a way out of the prison that debt can become.</P>
        <P>The Bill will not be palatable to many, but it is necessary.  Those who were more prudent, are not as unlucky or just getting by may well have difficulty with the legislation or some of its consequences for people they know or in wider society, but we must accept the principle that individuals can make mistakes, that it is okay to fail and that everyone &mdash; no matter the cause &mdash; can have an opportunity to start again.  It should also be recognised that the resolution measures contained in the Bill are not easy, but they seek to be just.  Responsibility is at the core of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I was going to continue as I have a number of questions to put to the Minister, but in the interests of fairness to Deputy Pat Breen and other speakers, I will formally submit my questions separately to the Minister whom I thank for introducing the legislation before the recess.  It is important that when we talk about debt forgiveness, the issue is resolved.  This is a small country.  We have small social, economic and business spheres and people remember things, but in so far as credit ratings are concerned, we must provide an opportunity for someone to start again once he or she comes through these procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Like Deputy Eoghan Murphy, I am delighted that it is going through the House before the summer recess, even if we have to sit until midnight, as it is extremely important.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues on producing this radical legislation which will overhaul the personal insolvency procedures.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Government for delivering on the commitment to help families who are struggling to repay their mortgage.  The Bill gives hope to thousands who are in mortgage arrears because it provides light at the end of the tunnel.  When we went into government, we made a commitment that we would try to help the people concerned.  Like other Deputies, I am well aware of the problems mortgage arrears pose for families.  I am assisting a number of families in my constituency who are in such a position.  It is not easy for them.  I have had lots of tears in my office from people encountering such problems.  The current process is cumbersome and provides little solace for those in trouble.  Previous speakers have stated negotiations with various interests can be difficult.  Some banks offer no leeway in negotiations with householders.  That is why a new and innovative approach is required.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the property bubble and the resulting recession the number in mortgage arrears has accelerated.  According to the Central Bank, at the end of March there were 764,138 private residential mortgage accounts in total, of which 77,630, or 10% of mortgages, were in arrears for more than 90 days.  When we look at restructured mortgages, it is interesting to note that of the total stock of such mortgages at the end of March, just over 40,000 were in arrears of varying length.  In essence, a sizeable number of people are still in mortgage difficulties, even where restructuring arrangements have been put in place.  We have all seen evidence of this.</P>
        <P>The scale of the problem is compounded by personal indebtedness.  In 2008, for example, the level of personal indebtedness equated to every household borrowing &euro;158 for every &euro;100 earned, which speaks for itself.  There is no simple or quick-fix solution because of the complexity of the problem.  I welcome the provisions included in the Bill that provide for a number of solutions for people in various circumstances.  It is also welcome that the Bill recognises those who ran up a substantial personal debt and whose circumstances have changed since they first took on the debt.  That is the case for many householders because at the height of the Celtic tiger people were encouraged to borrow and there were a number of cases in which people had taken out loans had since lost their jobs and were in real difficulty in paying back their debt.  The provision of debt relief certificate provides the opportunity for persons who have accumulated unsecured debts of up to &euro;20,000 to wipe the slate clean.  That is a welcome move.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts; Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has submitted his recommendations and proposals to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to bodies under his Department on the critical review list in relation to the mergers and amalgamations of National Cultural Institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35511/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced a series of rationalisation measures in its public service reform plan on 17 November 2011 and a number of amalgamations, mergers and critical reviews of bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote group are currently being progressed, as required under that plan.  Four bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote group were listed in Appendix IIb of the public service reform plan for critical review, namely, the Chester Beatty Library, Culture Ireland, the Heritage Council and the Placenames Commission.  In the context of furthering these critical reviews, my Department has met and consulted extensively with each of these bodies and also has consulted with a range of stakeholders.  I should say that in the overall context of the public service reform agenda, one of my key concerns is to ensure that all options are examined in order that the most appropriate implementation approach can be adopted for each institution.</P>
        <P>As for the four bodies listed for critical review in the Government&rsquo;s reform plan, I have now submitted proposals and recommendations to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.  These are being examined by his Department at present and I anticipate the Minister will bring a memorandum to the Government on these matters in due course.  In this context, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that I am not in a position to provide specific details on proposals and recommendations regarding the critical reviews at this time, pending their consideration by the Government.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I also have sent my proposed approach on implementation of the Government decisions on the amalgamation, merger and restructuring of various national cultural institutions and other bodies to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As this also will be subject to consideration by the Government, I am not in a position at this juncture to go into the matter in any detail.  I was, of course, able to give the House an insight into my overall thinking on these matters as they relate to the national cultural institutions during the Private Members&rsquo; debate three weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Members are no wiser today than they were three weeks ago during the debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by my party, at which time the Minister stated they should know within a short time.  I pressed the Minister at the time and was led to believe Members would know within weeks.  The Minister has confirmed his proposals have gone to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Has that Department reverted to the Minister with questions or queries regarding the submissions?  Will the Cabinet make a decision on these proposals prior to the summer recess?  When the Minister finally lets Members into his thinking on the amalgamations and regarding the bodies under critical review, does he intend to publish his cost benefit analyses to enable everyone to see the rationale in this regard?  I have spoken at length, both during the debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion and at other times, on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s thinking in respect of the merger of these cultural institutions.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that if the Government proceeds with what has been reported, it would constitute an attack on the autonomy of those cultural institutions and would be extremely short-sighted.  The Minister should clarify this point to Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I outlined to Deputy Troy during the aforementioned Private Members&rsquo; debate, his party proposed precisely the same measure when in government and continued with that policy right up to August 2010, during which time it advised people being appointed to boards that it would be for the duration of the board or until a possible merger or amalgamation took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il has changed its position subsequently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note this is Deputy Troy&rsquo;s last day as spokesperson for this portfolio, as he is moving on to another position.  I wish him the best of luck and acknowledge he raised many important issues.  Moreover, he generally was highly constructive on that side of the House.</P>
        <P>As I outlined in my reply, I have sent on my proposals to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He is reviewing the proposals at present and I doubt whether there will be any announcements before the summer recess.  However, that Minister certainly will bring proposals to the Government in the autumn.  As the bodies with which I am involved only comprise a small number of the State agencies under review at present, of which there are 48 in total, there obviously will be an announcement made in the autumn relating to a number of State agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed to realise and those concerned in the particular cultural institutions will be disappointed to learn that their fate will be left hanging over them indefinitely.  I imagine passing it over to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is a rubber-stamping exercise in that ultimately it is a decision for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  These institutions fall under the remit of his Department and I would be quite surprised were the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to challenge what he proposes.  It is disappointing that the Minister was unable to come forward today with a more realistic timeframe, which at least would let people know before the summer recess.  Does the Minister intend to publish the cost benefit analysis to support the decisions he will take?</P>
        <P>Finally, I thank the Minister for his kind words.  I enjoyed working as spokesperson for arts and heritage and I look forward to moving on to a new portfolio on Members&rsquo; return.  The Minister was pleasant to work with 95% of the time.</P>

	<P>In respect of cost benefit analysis, any time one shares services such as human resources or information technology and so on, one obviously saves money.  In addition, there will be a streamlining process and I hope that whatever will emerge and be decided on by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will improve the effectiveness of the cultural institutions.  This is my ambition and I note all institutions and the effectiveness thereof, including the Oireachtas, must be reviewed periodically.  This is precisely what is being done in this regard and is a good sign of democracy.  It is what democracy is all about, namely, continuous renewal and refocusing.  I have worked closely with the cultural institutions for years and am convinced and confident that whatever will emerge will be in the best interests of those institutions.  In general, when it happens I believe that while they may not all be happy with the outcome, they will accept it.  In the meantime, all the cultural institutions continue to work as before, in the interest of the Irish taxpayer.  They continue to do their work and in no way will they be impaired in their work by the ongoing deliberation in respect of the future of these institutions.</P>

	<P>Muna mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; acmhainn&iacute; acu, n&iacute; oibreoidh seo agus t&aacute; a fhios sin ag an Aire St&aacute;it.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; an rud c&eacute;anna nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina shu&iacute; ar an taobh seo den Teach.  T&aacute; seo iontach pr&aacute;inneach.  Bh&iacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht agus an arg&oacute;int againn an tseachtain seo caite, ach t&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it c&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il.  T&aacute; airgead ar f&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an Rialtas ag &iacute;oc airgid leis na sealbh&oacute;ir&iacute; banna&iacute; chuile bliain.  Caithfear tosa&iacute;ocht a chur le seo agus caithfidh an Rialtas dea-thoil a thaispe&aacute;int i leith na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; airgead ann ach caithfear tosa&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do chur i bhfeidhm na bpleananna.</P>
        <P>An tseachtain seo caite d&uacute;irt an Teachta Creed c&uacute;pla rud maidir le language imperialists agus mar sin de.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag tabhairt amach faoi daoine le l&iacute;ofacht sa Ghaeilge agus ag r&aacute; go raibh siadsan ar bealach mar naimhde don teanga.  Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le cloisint uaidh dochreidte.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint le cuid de na daoine as R&aacute;th Chairn, bh&iacute; siad faoi dhubh-iontas gur thug Teachta D&aacute;la &oacute; Fhine Gael an t-ainm &ldquo;language imperialists&rdquo; ar dhaoine le l&iacute;ofacht agus ad&uacute;irt gur naimhde don teanga iad.  Caithfidh muid a bheith i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin teanga.  Is f&eacute;idir linn breathn&uacute; ar an Bhreatain Bheag, Catalonia agus t&iacute;r na mBascach agus d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an rud at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acusan.  T&aacute; siad ag cur i bhfeidhm pleananna strait&eacute;iseacha ach t&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il acu agus de bharr sin, t&aacute; a dteangacha ag f&aacute;s.  M&aacute; ghlacann an Rialtas seo an strait&eacute;is ch&eacute;anna at&aacute; &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm sa Bhreatain Bheag, i gCatalonia agus i dt&iacute;r na mBascach, beidh seans athbheochana againn don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte &aacute;fach go bhfuil daoine gan Gaeilge ag r&aacute; go bhfuil daoine le l&iacute;ofacht mar naimhde don teanga.  An bhfuil aon tuairim ag an Aire St&aacute;it maidir le sin?</P>

Labhair an Teachta san Ghaeilge, ach d&rsquo;admhaigh s&eacute; nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a thoil aige.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar ionada&iacute; do cheantar Gaeltachta agus t&aacute; s&eacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh go h&eacute;ifeachtach chomh maith.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; liom f&eacute;in, is &eacute; an manadh at&aacute; agam n&aacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge bhriste chomh maith le B&eacute;arla cliste.  Is d&oacute;igh gur chuala an Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n &eacute; sin cheana.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute;thar &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il &mdash; t&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach &mdash; t&aacute;imid r&eacute;ad&uacute;il agus tuigeann muid agus an Teachta na deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; againn.  T&aacute; &euro;60 milli&uacute;n &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il do mo Roinn i mbliana f&aacute; choinne ciste na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  N&iacute; suim bheag &iacute; &euro;60 milli&uacute;n.  Lena chois sin, deir an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna go bhfuil s&eacute; ag cur &euro;500 milli&uacute;n isteach i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh airgead&uacute; ar TG4, ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta ar na tr&eacute;imseach&aacute;in a fhaigheann muid gach seachtain.  Nuair a cuirtear sin go l&eacute;ir san &aacute;ireamh, t&aacute; an-chuid acmhainn&iacute; ag dul isteach i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; mise d&oacute;chasach, mar Aire St&aacute;it at&aacute; anseo le bliain agus &oacute;n taith&iacute; at&aacute; agam ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; mar seo le blianta fada anuas, go mbainfidh muid an &uacute;s&aacute;id is fearr as na hacmhainn&iacute; teoranta at&aacute; againn.  Beidh an saol eacnama&iacute;ochta ag dul i bhfeabhas.  T&aacute; m&eacute; d&oacute;chasach agus t&aacute; misneach agam go dtarl&oacute;idh sin.  M&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute;, beidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il.  Ach san am i l&aacute;thair, is &eacute; an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; romhainn n&aacute; toradh fi&uacute;ntach a bheith ar an airgead at&aacute; againn agus muid ag gn&iacute;omh&uacute; taobh istigh de na teorainneacha sin.</P>

        <Quest>  the advice he will give for alternative funding for an organisation (details supplied) which has studios in Swords, Athlone, Navan, Ashbourne, Finglas, Balbriggan and Portlaoise in view of the fact they do not qualify for funding from the Arts Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels is devolved to the Arts Council which is funded by my Department but statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions.</P>
        <P>With regard to funding submissions by groups of the nature referred to, the Deputy will appreciate that any such submission would be for independent assessment and decision by the Arts Council.  Any such potential applicant approaching my Department would be directed to the council as a matter of course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Understandably, on foot of the recent violence in the Phoenix Park, people expressed their despair about the situation with many young people.  The incidence of suicide among young people and child poverty is on the increase.  In that context, we all agree that it is vitally important the Government take a hands-on approach to support any initiative or organisation which provides a real alternative to drug-taking, drinking and violence.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the plight of the Streets Ahead dance school.  While it is based in Swords, it involves hundreds of young people across north Dublin and beyond.  It is a fantastic outfit set up in 2004 and so far many of its members have managed to compete at national and international dance championships and competitions.  It deals with disadvantaged kids who otherwise could be in serious trouble.  However, it has been particularly hard hit by the recession and forced to reduce its numbers.  It is just about hanging on by its fingernails but is threatened with closure.  It cannot receive any funding support or a break in its rates because it falls between different stools.  The Arts Council claims because there is a competitive element involved, it cannot fund it, while the Sports Council claims it is not its responsibility because it is a dance organisation.  Will the Minister intervene and give it some advice on how it can secure funding?  It would be a significant loss if it did not survive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some weeks ago the Deputy and others were arguing for an arm&rsquo;s length approach between the Minister and the Arts Council to be preserved to ensure the Minister would not have a direct say in how arts funding was spent.  I remind the Deputy that I allocated &euro;63 million to the council to look after groups such as the one in question.  It makes its decision on funding, while I have to retain the arm&rsquo;s length approach.  I advise the Deputy and the organisation in question which does a good job to go directly to the council.</P>
        <P>In defence of the council, last year it spent &euro;3.1 million across all genres of dance.  It has a positive approach towards dance.  I would be delighted to give the organisation in question advice.  I work with various arts groups every day.  At 8 a.m. I met one such group with a very good proposal.  However, it is the council which is the funding agency and it is protected by this House.  As it is re-emphasised that it must be independent and at arm&rsquo;s length, I cannot direct it in cases involving funding.  Doing so would be against the law, as this approach is now enshrined in the Constitution.  I can meet the group in question to advise it.  The Deputy should take a direct approach with the council and put forward the group&rsquo;s case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not have the time to go into the details of the case, I would appreciate it if the Minister met the group.  The service it provides covers many Departments and the problem is that it seems to be falling between different stools.  I am not proposing that the Minister interfere with the Arts Council&rsquo;s provenance in arts policy, rather I am calling for the Minister to support a good initiative which is a small business but also a community service.  It nurtures young talent and plays a significant social role in north Dublin and beyond.  It has also enhanced Ireland&rsquo;s reputation on the international stage.  It is now faced with closure because of difficulties in navigating its way through the funding hoops of Departments and State agencies.  It would be helpful, therefore, if the Minister agreed to meet it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I will meet it.  If the Deputy contacts my secretary, Ms Sarah Doyle, we can arrange a meeting with it.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts; Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans to invest in heritage infrastructure in order to maintain productive jobs in the public and private sector; his plans to revitalise investment with key partners in local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35832/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is currently promoting the role that Ireland&rsquo;s heritage has to play in making our country an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the operation of our national parks and nature reserves and in the context of our unique built heritage.  Culture and heritage are important elements of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product, and heritage properties, including those in State care, are prominent tourism sites.</P>
        <P>My Department provides some limited funding under a number of headings for investment in the built and natural heritage.  It also supports the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust in their work in this area.  However, the scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State&rsquo;s built heritage is constrained by the current significant reduction in the public finances.  My Department, therefore, is focusing on working creatively across the Government and with partner bodies such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the rural development programme in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector.</P>
        <P>The recently published Heritage Council report, The Economic Value of Ireland&rsquo;s Historic Environment, provides comprehensive and evidence-based data which supports and enhances our understanding of the importance of our built heritage.  The report in question indicates that capital investment in built heritage conservation provides significant employment in the construction industry and is of major benefit to the national economy.  Such investment also assists in developing and maintaining specialised skills among conservation professionals and craftspeople.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to work on developing initiatives that contribute to the protection and appropriate reuse of our built heritage and the ongoing challenges facing our architectural heritage, such as adaptive reuse for historic properties and a forward-planning-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities.  A key initiative in this regard is the development of a specific heritage-led historic towns initiative in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council.  I expect that the initiative, which will be fully developed by the end of this year, will be piloted in 2013.  I am aware that Deputy McLellan has a particular interest in this matter because the town in which she lives, Youghal, is one of those involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards our natural heritage assets, Ireland&rsquo;s six national parks and 78 nature reserves attract a large number of visitors every year.  This adds significantly to the tourism product and brings economic benefits to rural areas, while also playing an important role in the conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s rich biodiversity and increasing awareness of our natural heritage.  A specific programme of capital works is undertaken, within available resources, at these properties each year.  Such works involve, for example, the provision of improved information or interpretation and the development of walks and, where possible, new visitor facilities.  Essential to these various initiatives is the involvement and collaboration of the relevant local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Ireland lags behind its European partners when it comes to intergovernmental strategies that position culture, heritage and the creative industries as the foundation of a new creative economy.  Between now and the end of 2013 the European Commission will be investing &euro;70 billion in developing the creative economy across Europe.  When one considers the position in Ireland, it is abundantly clear that there is an almost total lack of joined-up thinking on how to develop the sector and tap into its full potential in terms of revenue and employment.  Ireland lacks the sophistication of other member states which support intergovernmental strategies that position culture, heritage and the creative industries as the foundation of the new economy.  Derry, which is due to become the UK&rsquo;s first city of culture, is an excellent example in this regard.  That the latter is even possible is due in part to the flexible and smart decisions made by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, which is investing &pound;5 million in innovative initiatives in this area.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that I have provided an accurate description of the current state of affairs in respect of this matter?  Does he plan to reconsider the position in the context of investing along with local authorities in, for example, the historic towns initiative to which he referred, and which I welcome?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission&rsquo;s plans to invest &euro;70 billion in this area are the subject of a later question.  In the context of the funding that is available to us, we are investing a significant amount in promoting heritage and culture in this country.  In this regard one need only consider Kildare Street, on which two cultural institutions &mdash; the National Library and the National Museum &mdash; are located.  These institutions are visited by large numbers of tourists on an hourly basis.  If one goes onto the streets, one will see them.  They have free access to both institutions.  Last year the National Museum of Ireland attracted over 1 million tourists.  Cultural tourism is one of the reasons many people come to Ireland.  When Bord F&aacute;ilte and F&aacute;ilte Ireland carry out surveys, they ask people to outline the reasons they decide to come to Ireland.  Cultural and heritage tourism is generally found to be the main reason.  Although we are really using our cultural heritage, I accept we could do more in this regard and I will try to do so while I am in this job.  According to a report published by the Heritage Council last month, our historic environment supports approximately 35,000 jobs and contributes approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the economy.  Cultural tourism which involves the built heritage, our natural heritage and cultural heritage is a central part of the tourism industry and the economy.  As long as I am in this job, I will continue to emphasise as much as possible the promotion of cultural tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister&rsquo;s Department is facing budgetary constraints.  I look forward to the pilot scheme of the heritage-led historic towns initiative which involves my home town of Youghal.  I hope to see many more projects of this nature in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for local communities to avail fully of the pilot project which involves Westport, Youghal and Listowel.  The people of Youghal have a great opportunity to develop tourism in the town even further.  Youghal is interesting because of its connections with people such as Cromwell and its location at the mouth of the River Blackwater.  It has a great deal going for it.  I hope the three towns in question will enjoy a major spin-off from the initiative which I am sure the Deputy supports wholeheartedly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>Very much so.</P>

Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil an Rialtas ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar Bille na Gaeltachta 2012 agus an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeltacht.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh ar na ceantair Gaeltachta, at&aacute; roinnte suas i 19 limist&eacute;ir teanga, pleananna teanga a chruth&uacute; agus a thabhairt chun tosaigh le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n &uacute;dar&aacute;s, &oacute;n acadamh, &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute; shaineolaithe eile.  Is &eacute; an cusp&oacute;ir an Bhille n&aacute; an taoide a chasadh ar ais, sa d&oacute;igh is go dtiocfaidh ard&uacute; de 25% ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais sa Ghaeltacht amach anseo, de r&eacute;ir mar at&aacute; luaite sa strait&eacute;is.  Ba mhaith linn an rud c&eacute;anna a dh&eacute;anamh sa chuid eile den t&iacute;r.  Deireann 1.77 milli&uacute;n duine ar fud na t&iacute;re, idir Gaeltacht agus Galltacht, go bhfuil eolas de chine&aacute;l &eacute;igin acu ar an teanga agus labhra&iacute;onn 77,000 d&oacute;ibh an Ghaeilge gach l&aacute;.  Nuair a fheicim an dea-mh&eacute;in agus an dea-thoil at&aacute; don teanga ar fud na t&iacute;re, s&iacute;lim go bhfuil f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra againn.  Thug m&eacute; cuairt ar go leor gaelscoileanna, gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile a dh&eacute;anann a gcuid oibre tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Ba cheart d&uacute;inn dul i bhfeidhm orthu si&uacute;d at&aacute; dea-mh&eacute;in, dea-thoil agus taca&iacute;ocht acu don Ghaeilge.  Is &eacute; an cusp&oacute;ir uaillmhianach na strait&eacute;ise agus na reachta&iacute;ochta n&aacute; go mbeidh 250,000 duine ag labhairt an Ghaeilge go laeth&uacute;il i gceann 20 bliain.  M&aacute; oibr&iacute;onn gach &eacute;inne le ch&eacute;ile agus m&aacute; &uacute;s&aacute;ideann muid an dea-thoil, an dea-mh&eacute;in agus an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; l&eacute;irithe agam, t&aacute; d&oacute;chas agam go n-&eacute;ire&oacute;idh linn an cusp&oacute;ir sin a bhaint amach.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach soil&eacute;ir &oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Aire St&aacute;it nach bhfuil an foinse airgid cu&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in ann na dualgais&iacute; breise a bheidh aige &oacute; thaobh Bille na Gaeltachta 2012 a chomhl&iacute;onadh.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go maith nach bhfuil eagra&iacute;ocht Gaeltachta ar bith s&aacute;sta leis an mBille.  M&aacute;s l&eacute;ir don Aire St&aacute;it go bhfuil eagra&iacute;ocht &eacute;igin s&aacute;sta leis an d&oacute;igh ina bhfuil an Rialtas ag caitheamh leis an reachta&iacute;ocht, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go dtig leis an D&aacute;il a chur ar an eolas ina thaobh.  Cuirfidh Bille na Gaeltachta dualgais&iacute; faoi leith ar ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; pobail at&aacute; ag obair go deonach.  Ba mhaith liom rud a tharla sa tseachtain at&aacute; thart a luadh.

        <P>T&aacute; ceist eile agam ar an Aire St&aacute;it.

	<P>Is cinnte nach bhfuil aon cheist th&iacute;os faoin &aacute;bhar seo, faoi phearsa ar bith.  Ach mar sin f&eacute;in, ba mhaith liom an oiread seo a r&aacute;.

N&iacute; raibh a fhios agam gur cuireadh aon litir amach chuige go dt&iacute; gur th&aacute;inig s&eacute; agus gur labhair s&eacute; liom.  Rinne m&eacute; fiosr&uacute;ch&aacute;n ansin agus fuair m&eacute; amach go ndeachaigh litir amach chuige.  Sin an sc&eacute;al.  N&iacute; Roinn an-mh&oacute;r muid.  T&aacute; a fhios ag muintir na Ranna c&eacute; t&aacute; ag obair ins gach &aacute;it.  D&eacute;antar monat&oacute;ireacht i ngach Roinn ar cad at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ag na me&aacute;in maidir leis an Roinn agus le polasaithe na Ranna, agus tarla&iacute;onn an monat&oacute;ireacht c&eacute;anna i Roinn seo againne.</P>
        <P>Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; ar&iacute;s nach bhfuil aon ionchur ag an Aire mar a caitear leis na daoine at&aacute; ag obair sa Roinn ins an St&aacute;t Seirbh&iacute;s.  T&aacute; c&oacute;ras anseo &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t i 1922.  &Eacute;inne a th&eacute;ann isteach ins an St&aacute;t Seirbh&iacute;s s&iacute;n&iacute;onn s&eacute; conradh, t&aacute; rialacha agus c&oacute;d ansin agus caithfidh s&eacute; coinne&aacute;il leo.  M&aacute; d&eacute;antar aon trasn&uacute; air sin baineann s&eacute; le bainist&iacute;ocht na Ranna agus n&iacute;l aon bhaint ag an Aire leis.  N&iacute;l mise i mo Aire St&aacute;it ach le bliain agus fuair m&eacute; sin amach.  Aon duine eile a bh&iacute; ina Aire, tuigeann s&eacute; an rud c&eacute;anna.

        <P>Anois, rachaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; an cheist a cuireadh maidir le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus le cur chun cinn na teanga.

T&aacute; na m&iacute;lte acu &oacute; Dh&uacute;n na nGall s&iacute;os go Corca&iacute; agus t&aacute;imidne ag iarraidh ar na pobail sin cuidi&uacute; linn.  T&aacute; mise ag f&aacute;il glaochanna as gach aird den Ghaeltacht ag iarraidh orm coinne&aacute;il leis an rud at&aacute; m&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh mar go bhfuil m&eacute; ag tabhairt r&oacute;il do mhuintir na Gaeltachta don ch&eacute;ad uair ariamh.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag teacht anuas &oacute;n sliabh leis na deich n-aitheanta maidir leis an Ghaeilge, mar a dhein Maoise.  N&iacute; Maoise mise.  N&iacute;l ionamsa ach Aire St&aacute;it ins an Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;imid ag tabhairt deis dos na pobail seo a theacht amach, comhoibri&uacute; linn agus a r&aacute; linn cad ba mhaith leo a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh agus cad &eacute; a thig linn a dh&eacute;anamh f&aacute; choinne an teanga a choinne&aacute;il beo.

        <P>N&iacute;l mise a dhul a bheith anseo i rith mo shaoil.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute;n fhad a bheidh m&eacute; anseo.  Ach, ar a laghad nuair a fh&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; an Roinn t&aacute; s&uacute;il as D&eacute; agam go mbeidh m&eacute; &aacute;balta a r&aacute; gur chuir m&eacute; stop leis an tr&aacute;dhadh agus, m&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn aon rud, go dtiocfaidh an taoide isteach do lucht na Gaeltachta ar&iacute;s.  Is fada an l&aacute; &oacute; d&uacute;irt Seosamh Mac Grianna i 1932, &ldquo;Tabhair l&aacute;mh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina ngn&oacute;ithe f&eacute;in&rdquo;.   Sin an rud at&aacute; m&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh, an rud ad&uacute;irt Seosamh Mac Grianna i 1932.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag tabhairt deis do mhuintir na Gaeltacht l&aacute;mh a bheith acu i dtodhcha&iacute; a dteanga f&eacute;in don ch&eacute;ad uair.

        <P>Is dul chun cinn &uacute;r &eacute; seo.  Is dea-uair &eacute; seo.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh an pobal a mhealladh linn.  T&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; teoranta againn.  N&iacute;l dabht f&aacute; dtaobh de sin.  N&iacute;limid chun dul isteach ins an arg&oacute;int sin anois.  Ta &euro;60 milli&uacute;n &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il do mo Roinn agus &euro;19 milli&uacute;n a chur ar f&aacute;il do &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, agus caithfimid an &uacute;s&aacute;id is fearr a bhaint as na hacmhainn&iacute; sin.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam caid&eacute; an m&eacute;id a bheidh againn an bhliain seo chugainn.  Beimid ag troid f&aacute; choinne gach pingin agus gach euro.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh go leor againn.</P>
        <P>Ach t&aacute; mise iontach d&oacute;chasach, nuair a bh&eacute;as an Bille tr&iacute;d agus nuair a bh&eacute;as oifigigh na Ranna agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus daoine eile amuigh imeasc an phobail ag iarraidh orthu teacht linn, go rachaimid go l&eacute;ir ag si&uacute;l le ch&eacute;ile agus go dtiocfaimid i dt&iacute;r ar an dea-thoil agus ar an dea-mh&eacute;in sin at&aacute; imeasc cosmhuintir na h&Eacute;ireann agus ghn&aacute;th mhuintir na Gaeltachta, nach bhfuair deis go dt&iacute; seo.

Nuair a bh&eacute;as an Bille tr&iacute;d agus an strucht&uacute;r ansin againn rachaimid ar aghaidh &oacute; sin.</P>

	<P>Is ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at&aacute; feidhmeanna fiontra&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Nuair a bh&eacute;as an Bille reachtaithe leanfaidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ag comhl&iacute;onadh na ndualgas sin.  Chomh maith leis sin, beidh r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s ins an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain agus i bplean&aacute;il na limist&eacute;ir&iacute; plean&aacute;la Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Maidir leis na teorainneacha, an uair dheireannach a leagadh s&iacute;os teorainneacha na Gaeltachta sa t&iacute;r ba &eacute; 1956, n&oacute; 56 bliana &oacute;n am seo.  Is m&oacute; an t-athr&uacute; a th&aacute;inig ar an Ghaeltacht &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go l&eacute;ir go bhfuil ceantair ins an Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge l&aacute;idir iontu agus t&aacute; ceantair eile agus, bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, t&aacute; an Ghaeilge measartha l&aacute;idir iontu go f&oacute;ill, ach faoi bhr&uacute;.  N&iacute;l mise, mar Aire St&aacute;it, chun a r&aacute; go gcaithfear ceantar sin amach agus go gcoinneofar an ceantar seo istigh.  T&aacute;imid chun seans a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh na pleananna forbartha teanga a chur ar aghaidh.  Beidh bliain n&oacute; dh&oacute; acu chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid s&aacute;sta gur plean r&eacute;ad&uacute;il &eacute; agus go bhfuil spriocanna leagtha s&iacute;os, d&eacute;anfar monat&oacute;ireacht air sin ar feadh cupla bliain.  M&aacute; t&aacute; pobal adeir nach bhfuil aon fonn air a bheith sa Ghaeltacht n&oacute; plean teanga a dh&eacute;anamh amach, is cinnte go mbeidh impleachta&iacute; do theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; daoine i gcoinne an Bhille.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leo agus phl&eacute;igh m&eacute; leo &eacute; ar na me&aacute;in B&eacute;arla agus Gaeilge.   Is &eacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil siad ina choinne n&aacute; nach bhfuilimid ag tarraingt teorainneacha na Gaeltachta l&aacute;ithreach.  N&iacute; bh&eacute;adh s&eacute; sin ceart.  T&aacute; rud ar a dtugtar pr&oacute;is chu&iacute;, due process.  Beidh cead ag gach duine dul isteach agus m&aacute; thagann siad an&iacute;os leis na pleananna d&eacute;anfaimid &aacute;r nd&iacute;cheall.  M&aacute; dhi&uacute;lta&iacute;onn siad teacht an&iacute;os leis na pleananna beidh impleachta&iacute; ansin do theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.

Lig do oifig na n-acmhainn&iacute; daonna sa Roinn cib&eacute; rud a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ach mar Aire St&aacute;it, ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; cosaint a thabhairt do dhaoine at&aacute; ag obair go deonach ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun tosaigh agus a bheith mar ph&aacute;irt den phr&oacute;iseas dhaonlathach ag moladh leasaithe ar an mBille.

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 29 to 31, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My officials and I are not aware of a European Commission source of funding which contains &euro;70 billion for investment in projects or actions specific to the creative economy.  There are two European Union programmes operating in the areas for which I have responsibility.  The MEDIA programme is the support programme for the European audiovisual industry, details of which are available at <i>www.mediadeskireland.ie</i>.  The Culture programme is the EU support programme for organisations working in the field of culture, with details available at <i>www.ccp.ie.</i></P>
        <P>For the 2007-13 period, the allocation to the MEDIA programme is &euro;755 million, with &euro;400 million being allocated to the Culture programme, giving a total of &euro;1.155 billion over seven years.  A further figure of &euro;1.8 billion refers to discussions currently under way between member states and the European Commission on a new framework programme for the cultural and creative sectors.  This is intended to run from 2014 to 2020 and to be called the Creative Europe programme.  It includes a proposal to amalgamate the current Culture and MEDIA programmes under a common framework and to create an entirely new facility to improve access to finance.  Once the new programme is finalised, details of how to seek funding from it will be made available through appropriate information outlets.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to estimate how much any country will receive from any of these programmes as the funds are not distributed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  Calls for proposals are made periodically by the European Commission.  Applications are then assessed by an independent body, currently the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency.  Decisions on what support is provided are based on the relative merits of applications.  There is no quota for each country, nor is a specific amount allocated to each.</P>
        <P>I understand the directorate general for enterprise and industry in the European Commission issued a call more than a year ago for proposals for transnational co-operation projects on European cultural routes<i>, </i>with up to &euro;100,000 available per project.  The entire fund available for the programme was &euro;500,000 and the closing date for applications under this call was 7 October 2011.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald may be referring in her question to a European Commission call for co-operation projects to create transnational tourism products based on cultural and industrial heritage<i>.</i>  The closing date for this programme is 28 September 2012 and up to &euro;700,000 may be available in total for all 27 member states through the directorate general for enterprise and industry.  The application form and details of the criteria are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, <i>europa.eu</i>.</P>
        <P>The Government appreciates and values the contribution the wider arts sector makes to the reputation of this country.  Given the prevailing economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.  The Deputies will be aware that a report, Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland, published by the Arts Council in 2011 indicated that the arts sector provides significant direct and indirect employment, supporting some 21,300 jobs and contributing &euro;306.8 million in taxes.  The arts also affect the wider creative industries, which contribute &euro;4.7 billion to the economy and support 79,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>The heritage area is also increasingly identified as a primary stimulus in the tourism sector.  My Department is committed to promoting greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s rich heritage as a valuable amenity for business, farming and tourism and as a means of presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for sustainable inward investment.  A report published by the Heritage Council last month indicates that Ireland&rsquo;s historic environment supports more than 35,000 jobs and contributes in the order of &euro;1.5 billion to the national economy.  It also indicates that one fifth of total visitor expenditure in Ireland is attributable to our historic environment.</P>
        <P>Progression of the negotiations surrounding the Creative Europe initiative will almost certainly fall to the Irish Presidency of the EU.  In pursuit of advancing the initiative, I have already been involved in numerous meetings with Ministers of culture from other member states, Members of the European Parliament and other European officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Unfortunately, he did not respond to my question on how much the new European initiative might be worth to Ireland and how one might apply to it.  Will he provide more detail on the measures he intends to introduce to safeguard jobs in the sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know where the Deputy came upon the figure of &euro;70 billion to which she referred in her question.  As I indicated, the allocation under the MEDIA and Culture programmes for 2007 to 2013 was some &euro;1.1 billion, with &euro;1.8 billion earmarked for the period from 2014 to 2020.  I am very much engaged in the discussions on this programme with fellow member states.  A proposal has come from the Commission to which the European Parliament must respond, after which a compromise will have to be reached.  I am hopeful that an agreement might be reached during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency and that the proposed allocation of &euro;1.8 billion will be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>It has come to my attention that we have not drawn down as much funding under this programme as we have under, for example, the Common Agricultural Policy.  One of the reasons Irish groups and organisations might not have applied for grant aid from Europe under the programme is that the application process is complex.  Another factor is that in recent years, before the collapse of the economy, there was generally sufficient State funding, including increased funding for the Arts Council up to 2008.  We have done much better in respect of the MEDIA programme, not least because of the efforts of a very effective organisation called MEDIA Desk Ireland.  The organisation has been highly effective in encouraging the industry to apply for funding under this programme.  In this regard, I acknowledge the work done by Siobh&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue and others.</P>
        <P>While Irish organisations were not as successful in securing funding under the cultural programme, some organisations have secured funding and improvements have been made in the past year, with increases recorded in the number of applications submitted and the number of organisations receiving funds.  One of the major challenges facing Irish organisations is the requirement to find partners in other countries.  While it may be easy to find a partner in Northern Ireland, in cases where five or six partners are required organisations must find partners in countries on mainland Europe.  It is easier for organisations located on the Continent, whether in the central and eastern European countries which acceded to the European Union in recent years or western European member states, to find partners because many of these countries share borders with other member states.  This requirement places Irish organisations at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I will seek to have a more accessible application form introduced for the new programme.  I will also ensure the criteria are properly interpreted and assistance is provided to those applying under the programme.  I have discussed this matter with the Arts Council and will certainly make it a priority.  Given the likelihood that national funding for the arts will reduce in the coming three years, we must avail of every other source of funding.  Organisations need to fully capitalise on this programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is vital to draw down any grant aid that is available and I hope the Minister will take all necessary measures to ensure Irish organisations do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, one must apply for funding if one wishes to draw it down.  More Irish organisations need to apply for funding.  I have discussed this matter with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA.  I have also encouraged the Arts Council to co-operate with its counterpart in Northern Ireland and look outwards to find like-minded partners in Europe.  Perhaps they should focus on finding organisations in other Celtic countries and the Nordic states which share similar attitudes to us on culture and which may be applying for similar types of support.  I will prioritise this programme with a view to increasing funding for Irish arts organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The joint committee recently had protracted discussions with local authorities on arts funding.  In advance of engaging with other member states before a new tranche of funding is announced &mdash; despite having sat through many committee hearings on the arts, this funding was new to me &mdash; will the Minister encourage local authorities, through their twinning arrangements with local authorities in other European Union member states, to produce initiatives in this area?  As the Minister is aware, local arts officers in towns and counties are at the coalface of the arts.  If they have developed relationships with organisations in other member states, they may be able to bring something to the table to assist the Minister in his efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy makes a practical proposal.  In the past year, I have met local authority arts and heritage officers who play a critical role in promoting the arts across the country.  The Arts Council is a national organisation based in Dublin, whereas local authority arts officers do most of the work promoting the arts in small communities.  I envisage an important role for arts officers in the new programme because they have already reached out and established a large number of twinning arrangements.  Some towns are twinned with up to six partners around Europe.  Given the connections that have been made under the twin towns arrangements, it may be possible to use them as a vehicle for capitalising on the programme.  A great deal of work remains to be done.</P>
        <P>As I stated, our approach to this programme in the past was not sufficiently serious, primarily because the process was complicated.  Necessity means we must go through the process.  I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan for his proposal.  With Limerick set to become a city of culture in 2014, perhaps he will encourage arts organisations in the city and county to consider using the programme to maximise the amount of financial assistance available to Limerick for its 2014 programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the support his Department has provided for arts festivals and programmes in Galway, specifically the Galway Film Fleadh and Galway Arts Festival, the launch of which he attended last Monday.  I also commend Galway county and city councils and the Western Development Commission on the support they have provided.  I refer, in particular, to the Galway picture palace project, which I have discussed previously with the Minister.  I hope the project will secure funding from the Department and the other bodies to which I referred because it would add to the cultural and artistic life of the city and county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Galway has capitalised on culture to build a vibrant economy.  Shortly after the recent Volvo Ocean Race festival, we had the opening of the Galway Film Fleadh, which has been followed by the Galway Arts Festival and in a couple of weeks the city will host the Galway Races.  Galway is an example of a city that has used the arts and culture as a platform to rejuvenate itself and create a vibrant economy.  This vibrancy was in evidence throughout the city and not only in the city centre when I visited Galway last week for the film fleadh.</P>
        <P>As regards the Solas project to which the Deputy referred, my Department has committed a large sum of money to the initiative and its commitment will be honoured.  Unfortunately, we do not have any further resources to allocate to the project.  A shortfall of &euro;1.1 million in funding must be provided before Solas can proceed.  I appeal to the business sector and people in Galway to get behind the project.  They will ultimately benefit from the proposed new facility as they will be able to watch films in the three cinemas that will make up the project.  Moreover, the visitors who will be attracted to the city as a result will stay in hotels and guesthouses, which will benefit businesses.  Given the absence of further funding for the project, I hope local people will take up the challenge and buy into the project to ensure it is completed, as I am certain it will be.  Thus far, local businesses have not made any contribution to Solas, which is a large project worth more than &euro;6 million, although I am aware that efforts are under way in this regard.  Any town or city would be delighted to have a project that has received funding of more than &euro;6 million.  I appeal to people in Galway, especially in the city, to get behind the project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this issue, the 500 kV interconnector power line from Meath to Tyrone.  This initiative has been under way for a long time and I am glad we have reached this stage where we have an expert commission&rsquo;s report and a report by the Oireachtas committee.  I have tabled this issue to discover what the next steps are with this project.</P>
        <P>This project has been under way since March 2007, although it was kept quiet by those in power before the last general election.  It was given the go ahead without any proper consideration of alternatives.  The nod was given to drive this connector using overhead power lines regardless of that being right or wrong.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I will use my time today to deal with EirGrid&rsquo;s attitude from the very start of this development.  Its attitude was arrogant and out of order when dealing with people on a sensitive planning issue.  I am disappointed a semi-State body would take that approach.  I was also disappointed the then Minister did not have an open mind on this and was not willing to discuss it.  There were many questions at the time.</P>
        <P>We have come a long way in recent years and we have more answers, with the Oireachtas committee working on it in February.  There were many good hearings, with all sides getting a chance to discuss the issues at a proper forum.  That happened on foot of the report of the commission, which was published in January, and I thank the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for allowing the commission and starting this initiative.  I did not have faith in previous reports but most people I spoke to had full faith in the experts picked by the Minister.  They gave us a report that addressed technicality, feasibility and cost and that gave us an opportunity to have a real look at this with an open mind.  During many of the meetings I have had with the Minister in the last year or so, he has shown an open mind on this.  The attitude of EirGrid has also improved, which probably reflects the thoughts of the Minister of the day.  That does not, however, make up for the sins of the past and how it was dealt with from the very outset.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert commission clearly stated that it is technically possible to go underground with this interconnector.  Reliability is still a concern for some but all are agreed it is technically possible.  There is still a dispute over costs but at the first meeting I had with EirGrid officials, which Deputy Shane McEntee and Deputy Simon Coveney also attended, I was told this could not be put underground, that it was not possible.  Since then I, along with my other colleagues, Deputies Regina Doherty, Heather Humphreys, Se&aacute;n Conlan, Ray Butler and Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, have met EirGrid and we were told it would cost up to 40 times as much.  Since then, EirGrid has met people who have told the company it would be 20 times the cost, ten times the cost or eight times the cost.  It has changed so much that we are now debating two or three times the cost, and everyone accepts this can happen.  There has been a great improvement but what happened was disgraceful.  The unnecessary hassle, concern and cost to the communities we represent in Meath, Cavan and Monaghan was unacceptable.  Those communities had to fight a State organisation that was up to the job and did not check all alternatives.</P>
        <P>We are further on now with more information.  I thank the NEPP on behalf of the Meath and Monaghan anti-pylon campaigns for all the work it did with us as representatives to develop our thoughts on this and bring it to a stage where a proper report by international experts was commissioned.  It brings clarity to many issues.  The experts were clear that the high voltage direct current, HVDC, line was worth looking at.  In the early discussions, everyone ruled that out but the experts were very generous in saying it was due to improvements in technology, offering EirGrid an opportunity to excuse its behaviour.  That HVDC line was ruled out five years ago but now we know it is possible.  The debate continues about its reliability and the merging of areas but we can work on that.</P>
        <P>It is to be hoped we can use the reports by the commission and the committee to develop this further.  We must recognise the work that was done and at high cost to some involved in the process.  That is not the way it should be.  If any further planning applications are submitted in the years ahead, there must be a proper debate on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputy Damien English for raising this important issue.  The Meath-Tyrone transmission line has been in development since 2006 and has been marked by considerable local controversy, as Deputy English has noted.  In line with the programme for Government, I appointed an independent international commission last year to review the case for, and cost of, placing all or part of the project underground.  I received the commission report in January and forwarded it to the Oireachtas committee for debate and consultation.  The committee heard from all stakeholders, including local residents&rsquo; groups, and published its report on 15 June.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s report is not prescriptive and does not recommend any particular option.  In assessing technology options, the commission considers that a new HVDC underground cable would be a feasible solution, while estimating that the cost could be approximately three times as much as the overhead option, costs that would be borne by electricity consumers.  I note that EirGrid does not agree that placing the connector underground is appropriate for the North-South project on the grounds of both technical feasibility and cost.  The Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s report does not make definitive conclusions on the costs or technical feasibility of placing underground the North-South line.  It notes the differing views and also outlines some concerns about the new HVDC technology.</P>
        <P>The Government wishes to have policy certainty on the strategic and economic importance of developing infrastructure such as the proposed North-South transmission line.  Accordingly, following the reports of the expert commission and the Oireachtas committee, the Government this week considered a comprehensive memorandum dealing with the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure.  The Government approved a statement of policy on the matter, which I am publishing on the Department&rsquo;s website today.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required to have due regard to the policy objectives set out in this statement of Government policy.</P>
        <P>In the statement, the Government reaffirms the imperative need to develop and renew our energy networks to meet both economic and social policy goals.  The planning process provides the necessary framework to ensure necessary standards are met and comprehensive consultation is built into the process.  The Government acknowledges the need for social acceptance and the need to build community gain into project planning and budgeting.  The Government mandates the network companies to plan their developments safely, efficiently and economically.  They are also required to address and mitigate human, environmental and landscape impacts.</P>
        <P>The Government does not direct infrastructure developers to particular sites routes or technologies but it endorses, supports and promotes the strategic programmes of energy infrastructure providers, particularly EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 investment programme.  It is Government policy and in the national interest, not least in the current economic circumstances, that these investment programmes are delivered in the most cost-efficient and timely way possible, on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and the costs of different engineering solutions.</P>
        <P>On the Meath-Tyrone transmission line, I have advised my Government colleagues that it is now an operational matter for EirGrid to complete preparations for re-submitting a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, taking appropriate account of the reports of the commission and the committee.  It will be a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to address all relevant factors in arriving at a final decision, including the Government&rsquo;s policy statement.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with the Oireachtas committee that EirGrid must respect the need for early, ongoing, informed and transparent engagement with stakeholders and local communities in progressing its planning application, and I have made this view plain to EirGrid.</P>
      </Speaker>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his clarity and for updating us on the position.  As a local Deputy I am disappointed that the Government cannot or will not come out and specifically suggest a technology.  I would not expect the Government to suggest the route because I understand who will pick the route and I accept that.  However, I hope there can be direction with regard to the technology.  I accept it cannot be done for whatever reason.  Not even the committee could sort out the meshed network, but that work will continue.  However, for the purpose of clarity, is it fair to say that the door is open now for either technology to be used?  Five suggestions were given by the commission of experts.  Is the door open for everyone, including EirGrid, to examine this properly?  It may be possible to convince the company that this can be done within cost.  It is important to know the position because previously, that door was closed.  I am keen to ensure that I am reading the situation correctly.</P>
        <P>The other matter I would like to discuss is the question of whether the overhead option is the most economical in terms of costs.  I dispute the claim that the underground option would cost three times as much.  It may be less.  Even if it were twice as much we could have a debate and try to swing it over.  Is there room to manoeuvre?  Can we work on the costs in a timely way?  The experts never did so but will the Minister get an assessment of the real cost of delay?  We should factor these into the real cost of this project.  The Minister referred to informed engagement.  From my comments earlier, the Minister will realise that I never fully believed that EirGrid was informed about underground technologies or that it really sought to be.  I assume this means EirGrid must be so informed and that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have the power to assess the application on its merits and the case for all of these technologies.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that EirGrid must take appropriate account of the reports of the commission and the committee.  Will we be able to refer to those reports and to the experts&rsquo; opinions from the commission reports?  It is important to have these available and it is important that the people have trust in this application.  I have maintained in all of the debates that we need fair play and a fair crack of the whip.  I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that we will now have this opportunity, although I would have preferred if the Minister had announced today that we were putting it underground.  Will the Minister clarify that we will have a fair crack of the whip, that we will get a chance to argue for a certain technology and that EirGrid will be obliged to improve its listening and engagement style?  Otherwise this will not be dealt with properly by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy English and his colleagues in respect of the latter point that EirGrid must have regard to the policy statement endorsed by the Government yesterday.  That policy statement will be available this afternoon and will be sent to the various stakeholders concerned.</P>
        <P>Deputy English has put a blunt question to me about whether the door is open to underground options.  I have no wish to mislead the Deputy or the House.  The question can only be answered in the context of the statement of policy agreed yesterday.  Having said that, I am not being prescriptive about an issue that is best decided by the planning process.  Government policy is that any decision should be timely and cost-efficient, and I say as much given the times in which we live.  Deputy English will know that the Tyrone-Meath line is only one line in a transmission network envisaged in the GRID25 strategy.  I must be careful; there would have to be a compelling case to treat this one line differently from the rest.  However, when the Deputy has an opportunity to study the statement of policy he will appreciate that all the work put in by the international commission and Deputy Andrew Doyle and his committee is reflected in it.  EirGrid and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to the Government&rsquo;s statement of policy in the matter of the delivery of infrastructure for such energy projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>On 27 June this year Scoil Mochua, a special school on the Old Nangor Road in Clondalkin, Dublin 22, was informed by its special educational needs organiser that it would lose two teaching staff in the upcoming school year.  This is one example but it could apply to other special schools throughout the country, including St. Joseph&rsquo;s Special School in my constituency.  Scoil Mochua was subsequently informed that it would lose one teacher from the start of August.  Given that the school expects to have between 52 and 54 pupils enrolled in the coming academic year, this cut will reduce its pupil-teacher ratio below a level acceptable to meet the particular needs of the children in the school.</P>
        <P>The pupils attending Scoil Mochua are in the main severely or very severely physically disabled.  They have multiple disabilities and little or no independent function.  In many cases they are non-verbal.  In reply to a parliamentary question yesterday the Department maintained that the basis of the cut in teaching numbers in Scoil Mochua was that in the view of the National Council for Special Education the school &ldquo;has an appropriate level of teaching staff to cater for all of the children enrolled in the school from September&rdquo;.  However, the principal of Scoil Mochua believes that the NCSE has difficulty recognising the significance of the complex disabilities that affect the majority of the pupils at the school.  On this basis she strongly believes that the pupil-teacher ratio is wrong and will have a detrimental impact on the children&rsquo;s education.  This view is strongly shared by the parents of children attending the school.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister reverse this damaging cut to this school and other schools that cater for pupils with some of the highest levels of educational need in our society?  I call on the Minister to review &mdash; I am using that awful term again &mdash; the category of &ldquo;physical disability&rdquo; used by the NCSE to take account of the needs of severely physically disabled children, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio accordingly, and to review the category of &ldquo;multiple disability&rdquo; to include physical disability and other associated or additional disabilities.  This category should include severe communication difficulties, including an inability to communicate verbally, and limitations in independent function, especially with regard to hand function and personal care activities.  I have no doubt that if the Minister were to seriously undertake this review he would conclude that the current criteria used to determine the pupil-teacher ratio at schools such as Scoil Mochua in Clondalkin are inadequate.</P>
        <P>We are discussing the most vulnerable people in the education system.  They did not cause the economic crisis or the crisis in the banks.  In the majority of cases their parents were not the cause of these either.  These parents would go to the ends of the earth to try to get the best for their children.  The Minister will be aware of the sacrifices such parents have made over the years to try to get an education for their children.  They want to give their children a chance.  They maintain that one extra teacher, extra hours or extra support will make all the difference.  Given the multiple layers of disability experienced by its students, the school is asking for a review to be initiated by the Minister to examine this area and establish whether flexibility can be shown in the system in the case of such children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Crowe for raising this issue.  I advise the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the number of teaching staff allocated in the special school sector for the forthcoming school year.  The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE also is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing levels for the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools.  The NCSE operates within the Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Department has always valued the contribution made by special schools to the continuum of provision being made for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The Department is aware that many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.  The Department has, therefore, authorised the NCSE to allocate teaching resources in accordance with the complexity of need that exists within individual special schools, as opposed to primarily by school designation.  This is a significant change.  For example, a school which is designated to cater for children with physical disability may now have a mixed enrolment including children with multiple disabilities as well as children with physical disability.</P>
        <P>In line with its designation, this school will currently have a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1.  However, under the terms of circular 42/2011, the allocation in respect of the children with multiple disabilities will be improved from 10:1 to 6:1.  This provision will be of significant benefit to such a school.</P>
        <P>From the 2012-13 school year, all special schools will be staffed based on their actual current pupil profiles and the disability category of each pupil, and in future years school staffing schedules will be reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.</P>
        <P>The nature of the disabilities of pupils attending special schools means they have significant educational needs.  This is reflected in the level of teaching staff allocated to special schools.</P>
        <P>However, the Department is aware that a number of special schools currently retain posts which are surplus to their allocations.  The NCSE will manage the staffing of special schools and where necessary will suppress posts in schools, which have excess teaching posts, in order to ensure there are posts available to meet the needs of schools with growing pupil numbers.  Whereas I understand that schools may wish to maintain current staffing levels, the NCSE must ensure that, where there are surplus teaching posts in schools, these must be redirected to meet the needs of children who need this support.</P>
        <P>I have asked the NCSE to provide formal advice on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports which should be allocated to schools to provide students with special educational needs with the opportunity to develop to their full potential.  I expect this advice to be delivered early next year.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked that the Minister look at the idea of a review in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that the allocation for schools like this will increase, but this particular school tells me that on 27 June it was told it was losing two staff and, subsequently, it has been informed that it will lose one.  I am not sure whether that one is because the numbers are not growing in the school.  That is a possibility.</P>
        <P>My main argument is that these children, because of the multiple disabilities that many of them have, are outside the normal structure in the allocation for schools.  The Minister stated in his reply that he has taken cognisance of that but the difficulty is that this school is one of those that will lose a teacher.  Basically, that is what I am asking the Minister about.</P>
        <P>We all stood for election on the matter.  I note the positive manifesto the Minister set out in supporting schools, parents and children with special educational needs.  I suppose people want to see that coming about.</P>
        <P>This is one school that is affected.  It is losing a teacher.  It will make it more difficult for those teachers in the school.  It also will be more difficult to impart an education in the school because it is losing a teacher.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether there was an extra allocation in the school.  I suppose my appeal is that for schools like this there is a need to look at all of those multiple disabilities.  The argument of many in the sector is that the Minister is not taking cognisance of this and really looking at the needs of the child, and this is more about the needs of the education system rather than the needs of the child.  It is on that basis, on behalf of the most vulnerable children in the education system, that I ask that the Minister have a look at this again.  It is an area worth looking at.  The parents deserve at least that the Minister look again at this process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Government has maintained funding for resources for children with special educational needs at a time when, as everybody in the House will be aware, there is a continued requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government clearly states that education will be a priority for the Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the education experience of children, young people and students.  In this regard, the Department has prioritised the level of supports being provided to special schools.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate that there has been no reduction in the number of teaching staff allocated in the special school sector for the 2012-13 year.  That does not mean that some schools have not had a reduction in their allocation and that other schools have not had an increase, but overall there has been no reduction in the staff allocated in the special school sector for the 2012-13 school year.</P>
        <P>However, at a time of constrained resources it is necessary to manage and deploy resources as prudently and effectively as possible.  It is, therefore, necessary to suppress any surplus posts in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to ensure there are posts available to meet the needs of schools with growing pupil numbers.  I think the Deputy will agree that resources left in an area that are not in accordance with criteria mean public resources are not available for another deserving area.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber.</P>
        <P>Project Maths has been hailed as the answer to the below average standing of Irish 15 years olds in the OECD&rsquo;s Programme for International Student Assessment rankings of international student performance.  However, major questions and doubts have been raised about this new Project Maths subject.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that pupils are not being taught basic mathematical concepts.  I am concerned that we are giving 25% extra to honours mathematics instead of finding out exactly why our pupils are not doing better.</P>
        <P>The results in mid-August will show up in the usual Bell curve form and will not show the fundamental weaknesses in the system.  The same number of pupils will fail, the same number will pass and the same number will get As, Bs and Cs.  I have been informed by a corrector of the leaving certificate honours mathematics paper that in one of the 75 mark questions, based on the robotic arm, the marking system has been changed drastically because the results are so dismal.</P>
        <P>I am very worried about the mathematics programme and I will tell the Minister why.  An advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Wednesday last by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Due to the recent changes in the Leaving Certificate mathematics curriculum, the amount of calculus taught has been severely reduced.  As this subject is essential for preparation to third level courses in Mathematics, Science and Engineering (as well as Economics) and in order to give students with an aptitude for mathematics the opportunity to prepare themselves better for further study, a 10-week course on Mathematical Calculus will be given [in the college].</P>
        <P FLI="0">Sceptics might think this to be a money making ploy, but for that ten-week course a nominal fee of &euro;40 applies.</P>
        <P>I have tried to investigate this subject dispassionately, and despite contact from a significant number of students and, indeed, many of my own pass pupils who I know to be bright students and students who worked hard.  About 50% of the &ldquo;good maths&rdquo;, vectors, matrices and transformations, 60% of sequences and series, 40% of differential calculus, 50% integral calculus, and difference equations, have been removed from the mathematical paper.  Probability and statistics are now worth 50% of the marks on Paper 2.  In comparison with GCE A level, statistics is an optional question.  Of note also, this is the first leaving certificate maths exam where there was no choice.  Maths students had to complete all nine questions in part 1 and part 2 of the honours and pass papers.</P>
        <P>Many of our esteemed maths lecturers have expressed concerns at these radical changes, including Mr. Tony Dorlas in the UCC interim report, in the report from Mr. Ted Hurley and Mr. Stephen O&rsquo;Brien of NUI Galway and in the report from Ms Cora Stack of IT Tallaght.  All of the above maths professionals have expressed the view that Project Maths will have a negative impact on maths education.</P>
        <P>Experts from University College, Cork say &ldquo;exaggerated claims&rdquo; have been made about the benefits of the new approach to maths teaching.  Their criticisms range from the subject matter of the course to inadequately trained teachers.  They state that Project Maths was introduced with undue haste, which is hard to deny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  If the reply I give is not fully complete, I will come back to her in writing subsequently.</P>
        <P>Project Maths began as a pilot in 24 schools in 2008 and is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  It was mainstreamed from September 2010 when it became available to all schools.  The first mainstream examinations were for this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate students and the first group of students presenting for the junior certificate will be next year, 2013.</P>
        <P>The introduction of Project Maths has been accompanied by a national programme of professional development for all maths teachers, not just those in the project schools, and this will continue until at least 2013.  The Project Maths development team has provided extensive support to teachers.  Provision of approximately &euro;2 million has been made available within my Department for the development of a postgraduate course for what are known as &ldquo;out of field&rdquo; teachers who are currently teaching maths.  This is based on an intake of 390 teachers.</P>
        <P>A key objective of Project Maths is to improve attainment levels in maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.  The participation in higher level maths was down from a high of 18.9% in 2005 to 15.8% in 2011.  To encourage more students to present at higher level, there will be 25 bonus points available for all candidates who score grade D3 or above for higher level maths in the leaving certificate from this summer.  Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate this bonus points scheme for higher level maths for a four year trial period from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, with a review in 2014.</P>
        <P>Data from the State Examinations Commission highlight that for the 2011 leaving certificate examinations there were 9,950 candidates entered, with 7917 sitting the examination.  This year, there has been an increase to 12,510 candidates entered, an increase of approximately 25%.  I look forward to finding out how many of these entrants will present and I hope the majority will do so.</P>
        <P>Comments and observations regarding the leaving certificate maths exam papers are an intrinsic part of the feedback the State Examinations Commission would normally expect to receive in any year.  The well-tried methodology in place to deal with issues that arise in the course of the examination process is the development of the marking scheme by the chief examiner and his college of examiners in light of the circumstances of that year&rsquo;s examination.  Following a tendering process, the National Foundation for Educational Research was awarded the contract to conduct research into the impact of Project Maths on student motivation, learning and achievement.  Its work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the skills that are promoted through Project Maths are sought after by employers and the introduction of the revised syllabus has been welcomed by Forf&aacute;s, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, Engineers Ireland and industry interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his offer to come back to me with further information.  Further claims are being made that inadequate consultation occurred before Project Maths was launched.  In particular, it is claimed that the Irish Maths Teachers Association was under-represented on the NCCA board.  I ask the Minister to check how many fully qualified and probated teachers were on the NCCA curriculum board.</P>
        <P>In its interim report on Project Maths, UCC stated: &ldquo;There is an immediate need for a supply of textbooks to cover the new material.&rdquo;  It recommends that the NCCA, as a matter of urgency, should encourage the production of such textbooks, both in print and in electronic form.  The Minister might confirm if this is being prioritised.</P>
        <P>From my own observation, I would like to highlight that the paper poses particular difficulties to dyslexic students, and other academics have expressed similar concerns.  This year, students were forced to flick back and forth between an answer book and a question book, which were attached together, and many dyslexic students found this most difficult to manage.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue for future exams.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  We have many questions to answer and it is not just a matter of a quick response.  We need to think about why our children are not succeeding in maths.  Just because we are to give 25 extra points does not mean a student who gets a D3 grade in maths and earns 70 CAO points is capable of studying engineering or science subjects.  We need to look seriously at this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy once again for providing me with an opportunity to address the many concerns that have been expressed about the content of the Project Maths programme and the way in which it is being taught at present.  Project Maths is designed to transform teaching and learning in maths at both junior and senior cycle.  It should enable students to develop an understanding of the hows and whys of maths but also the ability to apply their knowledge and skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.  I recognise this is a considerable shift from the previous position.  The new format should also provide students with analytical and creative powers in maths.</P>
        <P>As I outlined earlier, there are many positive initiatives in place which aim to encourage more students to have the confidence, understanding and skills to pursue their studies in maths to higher level in the leaving certificate.  That was the primary motivation for providing the extra 25 points if a student takes the higher level and does not, on the day of the exam, opt to take the lower level.  This was as much as it was trying to do, no more, no less.  It is not a solution on its own; it is part of an overall approach to maths.  The other approaches include the introduction of the new Project Maths syllabi at both junior and senior cycle and, as I said, the provision of the 25 bonus points by higher education institutions for higher level maths students who succeed in achieving a D3 grade or above.  The increase of 25% in the number of entrants for higher level maths in the leaving certificate this year is, I believe, very encouraging, and I hope these entrants have already sat the higher level maths examination.</P>
        <P>Some concern has been highlighted in regard to this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate papers, which is normal.  As I said, the chief examiner and the college of examiners in the State Examinations Commission look at these matters.  The Government is fully aware of the importance of maths and other STEM subjects.  We will continue to ensure the initiatives I have outlined are prioritised in order that a quality maths education is available for young people both at junior and senior cycle.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s professional background in this area and her genuine concern and motivation in raising this matter.  With many others, I share the concerns about the quality of teaching in both literacy and numeracy at primary and secondary level up to higher level maths, and in regard to providing graduates from our secondary school system and third level colleges with a range of skills for which there is a market shortage throughout the world.  While I am committed to delivering change and improvement, the implementation requires a lot of time and co-operation.  I will be more than happy to discuss with the Deputy and other Oireachtas colleagues how best we can achieve this.</P>
        <P>Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom in this regard, and I do not claim that I do.  However, it is obvious from what has been said in recent years when I was in opposition that we had to address the mathematics issue.  Project Maths was an attempt to start to do this.  We are not complete in terms of the way it will be implemented and will continue to improve it.  I am also aware of the issues concerning the provision of suitable textbooks.</P>

      <sTitle>Defence Forces Reorganisation</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic.  It is important as we move towards the last day of this session that we have an opportunity to have a brief discussion with the Minister.  I appreciate his presence to deal with the issue directly because his recent announcement on the further reorganisation of the Defence Forces is of considerable importance.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that we are all living through a period of public service reform.  There was talk about reform of the public service for decades, but it is only in the past four or five years that have we seen meaningful reform.  Unfortunately, that meaningful reform has been forced on us by economic necessity.</P>
        <P>If we consider the Defence Forces and their history, we will see that even during the Celtic tiger period when money was not an issue and Governments were investing substantial amounts of money, in terms of both the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces and in providing the modern equipment a modern army embarking on peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions needed, there was a process of reform in the Defence Forces.  Barracks numbers were reduced from 34 to 14 and, in fairness, the representative bodies, RACO and PDFORRA, engaged in a constructive and meaningful way with the Government on the reforms they were being asked to undertake.  In addition to barracks number reductions, we saw personnel numbers decline from 11,500 to 9,500.  I commend the Minister for his commitment in his announcement yesterday to maintain the figure at 9,500.  However, what is worrying for people who have an interest in this topic is that the announcement has been made in advance of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to publish a Green Paper and the value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force.  One wonders how the Minister can stand over the taking of that initiative, while at the same time being committed to following a Green Paper process and a value for money review.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me, not least given that I come from County Kildare where the Defence Forces are at the heart of the community and the economy of the county, not to say there is deep disappointment on the part of the representative bodies, RACO and PDFORRA, that there was no active engagement with them, although the Minister can contradict me on this, before the announcement was made.  It is not to say they are a particularly truculent or difficult pair of representative bodies to deal with; they are anything but, rather they are reasonable and would state to the Minister, as they indicated to my party when it was in government, that they were to the fore in the public service in accepting meaningful change and adopting a reform agenda.  They are disappointed that this significant announcement has been made without adequate, if any, consultation with them.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a sense among the membership of the Defence Forces that the move from three brigades to two is not necessary and that reform could be achieved within the overall figure of 9,500 members.  There will be disappointment in a number of areas, not least in Athlone where it appears that there will be a further reduction in the number serving, with an impact on the local economy.  The Minister might indicate whether a cost benefit analysis has been undertaken.  Can he assure us there will be no further barrack closures and on the implications for the career path of the officer corps within the Defence Forces in the structures he is trying to put in place?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to constructive engagement with the Deputy in the House which I hope will not always be conflictual.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force.  As the Deputy knows, in December 2011 I announced a revised ceiling of 9,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force and a reorganisation of the Defence Forces, encompassing a move from a three brigade structure to a two brigade structure.  The Cabinet agreed to stabilise the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 and recognised that a three brigade structure was no longer viable.  This reorganisation is driven by the immediate realities of retaining operational effectiveness within a strength ceiling of 9,500 at a time when financial resources are limited.</P>
        <P>I tasked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of my Department to bring forward proposals for the reorganisation for my consideration.  I have accepted their recommendations and yesterday was pleased to announce the details of the reorganisation.  I am satisfied that the reorganisation will ensure the Permanent Defence Force will retain the capacity to fulfil the roles assigned to the greatest possible extent within the strength ceiling of 9,500 and the significantly reduced resource envelope resulting from the fiscal difficulties of the State.  This was confirmed in the report I had received from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.</P>
        <P>I am continually surprised by the misinformation promulgated in recent weeks, up to this morning&rsquo;s publications in the newspapers, on the reorganisation.  There are a number of issues which it is important to clarify.  The reorganisation will not result in job losses.  It will ensure the units within the Permanent Defence Force are configured appropriately and reflect attainable strength levels.  As part of this process, the reorganisation entails the amalgamation of under-strength units into full strength units.  Clearly, this does not equate to job losses.  It ensures actual jobs are reflected in organisational structures.  Continued reference to notional jobs associated with outdated and revoked strength levels is misleading and disingenuous.  The reports in newspapers today that 500 jobs will be lost as a consequence of this reorganisation are entirely untrue.</P>
        <P>Contrary to recent assertions, my decision to initiate a reorganisation was made following a detailed assessment of the defence and security environment and consideration of associated Defence Forces capability requirements.  This was conducted both as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure and during the preparation of the Department of Defence and Defence Forces&rsquo; strategy statement.  Both documents have been published and are available for viewing.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy mentioned, a Green Paper on Defence is being prepared.  When published at the end of the year, it will inform a broad discussion about Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy.  This will culminate in the publication of a new White Paper on Defence at the end of 2013.  This White Paper will set out defence policy and encompass a longer timeframe than that of the strategy statement.  It will inform long-term capability requirements for implementation over an extended timeframe, typically ten or more years.  The reorganisation is driven by the immediate realities of maintaining required operational capabilities within a significantly reduced resource envelope as a consequence of the fiscal difficulties confronting the State.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy asked me to say so, I repeat that there will be no further barrack closures as part of this reorganisation, nor will there be further barrack closures within the lifetime of the Government.  It seems I have to say this repeatedly every six weeks or so inside and outside the House.</P>
        <P>Having clarified these issues, it is important to highlight the positive impact the reorganisation will make in ensuring the continued delivery of Defence Forces operational capabilities and outputs, both at home and overseas.  The reorganisation will ensure the Defence Forces remain fit for purpose and continue to deliver value for money.  It is an excellent example of the public sector reform agenda in action, to which the Deputy referred.  It proactively addresses the challenge of ensuring the continued delivery of operational capabilities and outputs within the current resource constraints.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have a proud track record in implementing significant changes of this nature, while minimising the impact on personnel to the greatest possible extent.  I am aware that, ultimately, it will be the men and women of the Defence Forces who will deliver this reform.  The representative associations were informed yesterday about the reorganisation taking place.  I look forward to their engagement on the undertaking of the reorganisation process.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his words of welcome.  I look forward to working with him in this brief and wish him continued success in his role.  Am I to take it from his reply that the 2012 budget for the Department of Defence is running behind target?  Is that why we are faced with making savings?  Will savings accrue from the initiative?  Will the Minister clarify whether he engaged in a cost-benefit analysis process?  Am I correct in understanding no discussions took place with the representative bodies before the announcement was made?  Why was that the case?  When one is dealing with representative bodies which are constructive in their approach and can demonstrate goodwill towards the Government, it is a mistake, at the very least, not to engage with them.  I urge the Minister to retrospectively rectify the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Government and me as Minister for Defence in consultation with the Chief of Staff to make decisions on the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  It is not a matter for negotiation with the representative bodies.  The correct legal approach was taken to provide for the reorganisation.  When the arrangements proposed for it were agreed between the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief of Staff and the Cabinet was so informed, we immediately arranged for the representative bodies to be informed of the nature of the reorganisation.  I fully accept that they have played a constructive role during the years and that there is the human element in undertaking the reorganisation and the impact it will have on individual members of the Defence Forces located in various parts of the country.  That is a matter that will be discussed constructively and on which there will be engagement with the representative bodies.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised by the Deputy, I do not envisage that we will be over budget at the end of the year.  This is not about making additional savings; rather it is about living within our budget targets and using our resources in a wise way to ensure operational effectiveness within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, many misleading comments have been made.  I have no wish to have a disagreeable exchange with the Deputy because they have not been made by him but by members of his party.  He did make reference to the economic impact of the reorganisation, for example, in Athlone.  He has in his party a Deputy who is running around telling people that there will be a reduction of 400 troops in Custume Barracks.  He has led the charge on that issue in public meetings and was even a cheerleader for a protest held outside Leinster House one week ago.  There are 1,050 members of the Defence Forces in Custume Barracks and I said all along that there would be approximately 1,000 members in Custume Barracks at the end of the reorganisation.  The actual troop number in Custume Barracks as members of the Permanent Defence Force is 971.  There are 35 civilians in Custume Barracks.  In addition, there are exercising and training activities which impact on the numbers there which frequently will result in the number of members of the Army exceeding 971.  No one could suggest in practical terms that a reduction of approximately 70 troops permanently located in Custume Barracks will have a dramatic impact in Athlone and that barracks playing a very important role within the Defence Forces as part of the reorganisation.  In fact, Custume Barracks has the second largest number of troops, which is only exceeded by the number at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin.</P>
        <P>This reorganisation is in the interests of the country generally and the Defence Forces in order to maximise its capability.  It will ensure we will have full units, with their appropriate specialties.  In determining where specialties should be located I am very much informed by the advice of the Chief of Staff and those with the internal expertise to make these judgments.  I thank the Deputy for raising what is an important issue and look forward to working with him in the coming months.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="OA" LHead="Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: " RHead = "Second Stage (Resumed)" > 
    <Title>Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>As well as being in mortgage arrears many people have substantial unsecured debts and are struggling to pay off their debts because their incomes have reduced substantially since they took on the original debt.  The debt settlement arrangements provided for in the Bill will allow such persons to apply to the insolvency service for a protective certificate while they are preparing a debt settlement arrangement.  The biggest complaint of my constituents in this category concerns the unwillingness of the lending institutions to give them adequate time to sort out their affairs.  This proposal will give people some breathing space as they try to resolve their situation.</P>
        <P>The protection which the Bill offers for principal private residences in cases where individuals have entered into a personal insolvency agreement is something for which people have been waiting for some time.  Repossession orders should be a thing of the past.  Repossessions are in nobody&rsquo;s interests, especially in a period when house prices are falling.  While the lender might recoup some finance from the sale of a repossessed house, the entire process is extremely traumatic for the families involved and in any case it is the taxpayer who ends up picking up the tab for those who have to be rehoused by local authorities or through the payment of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>The family home is hugely important to Irish people.  It may be as a result of historical experiences that this country is ranked sixth in the world in home ownership, with economies such as the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany.  The statutory duty placed on the insolvency trustee ensures that in preparing the personal insolvency agreement the debtor will be allowed to remain in his or her own house.  That is a significant move which will ease worries for families living with the threat of eviction.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the proposals set out for the new insolvency service.  It is proposed that the necessary resources be given to the service in order that it can deal with the scale of the applications likely to come before it once the legislation is enacted.  I would like to see the MABS involved in the process.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that it will continue to have a valuable role in assisting and advising people with debt problems.  I cannot speak highly enough of the professional advice and financial statements produced by it to support people in trouble and I am pleased that it will have a role in the new system.</P>
        <P>It is important that the financial institutions buy into the new insolvency legislation.  I appeal to them to embrace it and work with us in that regard.  I meet families every day who are struggling to pay their debts and I am conscious of the pain and upset they must endure.  The legislation provides a lifeline for them.  People are most anxious to have the provisions in the Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I, therefore, appeal to the House to support the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill which is a positive step in dealing with the financial crisis in which we have found ourselves in recent years.  Many have been waiting a long time for legislation such as this.  One of the first people who spoke to me following my election asked me whether it would be possible to do something about the bankruptcy laws.  The Bill is a welcome step in that regard.</P>
        <P>I frequently refer to the language used in Bills.  All constitutions stem from the Magna Carta, which was issued back in 1215.  I believe the Magna Carta must have been written by a barrister or a lawyer because it was written in Latin, which was a dead language at the time.  It was then translated into the vernacular, which in England happened to be French, before being translated into English.  I often wonder in what language some of those who write the Bills that appear before the Oireachtas work.  In this context, I again mention section 97(6), which includes a sentence of 367 words.  I do not know the person who wrote it but most of us who were obliged to write essays for our leaving certificate examinations would easily get two essays out of that single sentence.  I know people who may have fallen asleep by the time they got half-way through it and would have been obliged to focus on it again.  I again plead for the language used in Bills introduced to the Oireachtas to be made as simple as possible in order that ordinary Joe Soaps like me may be able to understand it.</P>
        <P>I also have a couple of suggestions with regard to the Bill, the first of which pertains to the debt relief notice.  Such debt relief notices will allow for write-offs of up to &euro;20,000 and specifically are being provided for those who have no assets and no possibility of paying back the loan.  Under a debt relief notice, one is liable to be under supervision for three years.  Many young people were caught up in the tide of the Celtic tiger and now find themselves in a position in which they are in debt.  Some of them may only owe &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 but have no means of paying it back.  However, if they avail of a debt relief notice, there will be an onus on them to be under supervision for up to three years.  If possible, I suggest that this period be staggered.  For example, for write-offs of up to &euro;10,000, one might only be under supervision for a period of one year, for a write-off of up to &euro;20,000, one could be under supervision for two years and for more than &euro;20,000, one could be under supervision for a three year period.  I specifically refer to those younger people who bought cars or who took out unsecured loans for holidays and so on and who now find themselves in a position whereby they cannot get out and move on with their lives for a period of time.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of including such a measure in the regulations.  Depending on the scale of what such people owe, the Minister might consider periods of one, two or possibly three years in the case of amounts of more than &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P>I have a major concern regarding the regulation of the proposed personal insolvency practitioners.  The current crisis arose from much poor regulation of the banking system and my concern is that the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners might be weak.  The Minister should strengthen whatever legislation or proposed regulations he has with regard to the aforementioned practitioners.  My fear is that certain individuals, who would not be fit for purpose as personal insolvency practitioners, would manage to advise people.  My concern is the advice such people gave in the past may have led to individuals getting into trouble, only for the former to now advise the latter on how to emerge from trouble.</P>
        <P>I also have a slight issue with something that got many people into the position in which they now find themselves whereby they need this legislation, that is, some of the products that were sold by banks.  While each individual person must make up his or her own mind with regard to what products to take from banks and what decisions to make with regard to financial security, banks sold and offered products to people who in no way were fit to make a proper decision about them and who in consequence find themselves in need of this welcome legislation.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister the best in respect of the passage of this legislation.  It is a vital cog in the future of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and I will support the Bill in its passage through the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>While considering the literature on this topic, I was struck in particular by the nine key principles drawn up by a number of highly reputable organisations with a strong track record and a strong commitment to working with people.  I refer to organisations such as the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland, Threshold and Respond!, to name a few.  Basically, their call is for a fair and equitable response that really gets to the heart of this issue.  We live in a society and time of excessive indebtedness, courtesy of the Celtic tiger and the pressure to buy into the excesses of that time.  I completely acknowledge the principle of personal responsibility for decisions that everyone, as individuals, make.  I grew up at a time when money was scarce and there was a struggle to make ends meet.  People saved out of extremely limited resources and bills were paid, if not on time then eventually, and it was a time when many people, particularly where I lived, did not have bank accounts.  I remember the efforts of family members and friends to save for the deposit on a house, which is markedly different from the position today.</P>
        <P>Today, one sees a society that is crippled with this excessive indebtedness and I was struck by a quote from the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, a few months ago, when he stated: &ldquo;Not all economic crises have left as substantial a legacy of personal debt as has the current global crisis.&rdquo;  The organisations mentioned earlier perceive this as coming from an inability, rather than a lack of willingness, to pay on the part of those in debt.  Their principles also included a call for comprehensive information to quantify the extent of the debt problem and for solutions to take into account all debt liabilities in order that they would be workable.  In addition, they called for the personal insolvency legislation currently under discussion.  Another principle is that the insolvent debtor should pay to the best of his or her ability for a limited time period and then for the remaining debt to be written off.  Moreover, those in debt need to have someone to represent their interests when negotiations are under way because such negotiations can be extremely difficult.  In addition, they need a minimum income to meet their basic needs while repaying the debts.  On the latter issue of a minimum income to meet people&rsquo;s basic needs, discussing basic needs is a matter of interpretation and I go along with some of the NGO organisations in this regard.  They also called for the unsustainable mortgages to be recognised as such and that when repossession occurs, for appropriate housing to be provided.  However, before that, which makes sense, the State should try to keep people in their homes with the ongoing mortgage or as tenants.  I believe all these principles are sound and can be supported.</P>
        <P>If one considers particular aspects of excessive indebtedness, those who cannot pay their essential living expenses and debt repayments as they arise are at the heart of the problem.  Moreover, it is not just about mortgage arrears but is much broader because while I acknowledge personal responsibility, there are factors that go beyond the personal, such as unemployment, businesses collapsing and ill-health.  During the so-called good days of the Celtic tiger there is no doubt that people over-extended.  I can recall receiving letters through the post from banks asking whether I wanted &euro;10,000 that day, and at one point I believe I was being offered &euro;20,000.  As for the mortgages that were on offer, they were not merely 100% mortgages with no deposit upfront.  People also were asked whether they needed further capital for furniture, decking out the back or a conservatory, as the financial institution would throw in a few thousand more.  While it was extremely tempting for many people to opt for instant gratification, the consequences are known.  As for property portfolios, I can understand the person who bought a second property as a pension fund.  However, I find it difficult to find sympathy for those who went really gung ho for X, Y or Z number of properties.  In my constituency of Dublin Central, in common with other constituencies I am sure, there is a preponderance of rogue landlords, that is, property buyers who are causing untold damage to long-established communities with their disregard for all planning and environmental laws and regulations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>This constitutes one of the excesses of the Celtic tiger.  Only this week, I was asked to visit a flat in the inner city, which is privately owned by a landlord.  I believe I may still be in shock at the conditions in which people were living, as my dog has much better accommodation than do they.  Such rogue landlords also were created by the banks because of the extent of borrowing available.  The priority must be to protect the individual at the other side, whose home is under threat.  The institutions, that is, the banks and financial companies, are the primary causes of the excessive indebtedness one now sees, as well as the inaction and disinterest of those who should have known better, which also was a major factor.  Those who should have known better in fact were fuelling this via the tax breaks and tax incentives and by ignoring completely best economic advice, both in Ireland and abroad.</P>
        <P>Many who are excessively indebted have lost jobs and businesses and are trying to live with considerably reduced resources.  In consequence, they lack the capacity to repay loans or pay the bills or both, which is a nightmare situation.  While it is one thing to come from nothing to something as a progression, to come from a lot to nothing is a completely different scenario.  I have in mind areas in Dublin Central and in the inner city in which people tell me the Celtic tiger passed them by.  They did not get into the excesses and did not buy the additional properties here and abroad.</P>
        <P>They did not buy big cars, go on shopping trips to New York and three and four holidays per year.  They did not benefit from the Celtic tiger, but they are now suffering more owing to the economic downturn.  The defunct Christmas bonus is an issue for elderly inner city residents, as that is all many of them got from the Celtic tiger and it is now gone.</P>
        <P>The statistics show that at the end of 2010 one in ten residential mortgages was in trouble.  A few months later one in nine was in trouble and a few months after that one in eight was struggling.  There is still a significant number who have the ability to pay, but I know that some within this group are just about managing to repay their mortgage.  We think of the property bubble when people were encouraged to buy with various inducements, not to mention the very strong media and financial institutions hype which suggested that if people did not get on the property ladder, they never would, as prices would continue to rise.  People took out mortgages sometimes of over &euro;250,000, &euro;300,000, &euro;400,000 and more to purchase houses and apartments that they knew were probably worth half of what they were paying.  There was false advertising and incorrect advice, but who is being accountable for this?  We know that those who are paying are the ones in negative equity.</P>
        <P>The number of voluntary surrenders or abandonments in one period is greater than the number of repossessions.  We know that there are long waiting lists for social housing; therefore, people have no option but to return to the rented accommodation system that I described, although I acknowledge that there are some landlords with ethical standards.  Some mortgages are just unsustainable and the mortgage interest supplement could be used more effectively.  Central to the issue of mortgage resolution is keeping people in their homes and avoiding placing additional pressure on the local authorities such that people avoid the nightmare that is the private rented sector.  Options include availing of the mortgage to shared equity and the mortgage to rent schemes.  The former involves the State purchasing a dwelling at a substantial discount from the lender and then allowing payments in instalments in such a way that the current financial situation is taken into account, as well as the option for the person concerned to buy back if and when his or her situation improves.  The mortgage to rent scheme brings in the housing association or local authority and the former owner becomes a tenant paying rent that he or she can afford.  I know some have reservations about this scheme.  Another group which needs protection includes those tenants in buy-to-let apartments in cases where the owner-borrower is in danger of having the building repossessed.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns of others who have spoken about the review process and think ten years is too long.  It should take place sooner because so much is at stake.  There will be a new body &mdash; the Insolvency Service of Ireland &mdash; with a director and staff.  There will be yearly reports, strategic and business plans going to the Minister and then the Oireachtas.  The director may be called before the Committee of Public Accounts, but I wonder if there is a need for the director to go before a committee when requested to do so.  The name personal insolvency practitioners &mdash; PIPS &mdash; is not conducive to highlighting the serious role they will play.  They will be vital in the operation of the debt resolution process.  I presume they will receive extensive training and that there will be an extensive oversight procedure.  The banks&rsquo; veto is of concern and I hope the insolvency service can work through it to the benefit of those in debt.  Let us suppose the banks do not want to buy into this process.  That is an issue that will have to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>As the Bill is complex and the language inaccessible, I hope the people in debt will be able to understand what is available.  Perhaps there is a role for FLAC and the citizens advice bureaux to play.  An additional worry for some is the social welfare supports.  Yesterday or today I read a press release from the European Anti-Poverty Network which highlighted the serious failure of the European Union&rsquo;s 2020 strategy to promote coherent anti-poverty strategies.  The quote is that there is a steady slide towards more poverty, exclusion and inequality for the majority.</P>
        <P>I wish to be sure that the homeowners and their families who are truly in debt will be the ones who benefit most from the Bill, not those with the large investments and the property portfolios.  The publication of the Irish League of Credit Unions &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Left&rdquo; contains some interesting statistics.  It states mortgages and rents continue to be the most expensive bills, followed by groceries, utility bills and transport costs.  It tells us that half of all consumers struggle to pay all their bills on time, but it is very distressing to read that there are 1.82 million adults across Ireland with less than &euro;25 left per week after they pay their bills.  As reckless banking led to personal recklessness, I am not sure why we are not going down the road of calling for a financial transaction tax and going back to the idea of a Tobin tax.  Such as tax could generate massive amounts of money in revenue.  It would have to be done globally and simultaneously, or else we would have speculators moving to those countries with fewer tax reductions, as they do today.</P>
        <P>During Private Members&rsquo; business last night we dealt with the  Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2012 and the issue of moneylenders.  There are two varieties of moneylender &mdash; licensed and unlicensed.  There are problems with both and unless the banks get it right, there will be greater recourse to these moneylenders, in spite of the best efforts of the credit unions which do a great job in encouraging saving, no matter how small the amount is.  For every &euro;100 borrowed, one particular licensed moneylender charged &euro;56 for one year.  Therefore, the APR on a six month loan is 187.2%.  One can only imagine what illegal moneylenders charge.  From discussions with community workers and others, we know that once the moneylender moves in &mdash; licensed or unlicensed &mdash; it spreads like wildfire.  People are in need of what is known as doorstep credit because there will be emergencies and they will need cash quickly, but not at what it will cost them.  A major problem in parts of Dublin Central is that families are borrowing money to pay the drug debts of family members.  It is vital, therefore, that people who need money and are in debt can avail of funds in an equitable way.</P>
        <P>Any Bill has to be measured by how good it is for citizens.  There is much in this Bill that is good for citizens, with a few reservations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Ciara Conway and Ann Phelan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaraConway"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciara Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for publishing the Bill which deals with a very complex issue.  It is great to have an opportunity to discuss it in the House before the term finishes.</P>
        <P>The last Administration left behind an appalling legacy, with crippling debts being saddled on the shoulders of citizens.  After 15 years of mismanagement, we finally have radical and workable legislation to deal with the debt crisis  The Bill reforms legislation which has been in place for over a century and seeks to ensure that in coming years there will be better structures in place for all families, not only those in difficulty.  Struggling homeowners will be able to enter into arrangements, on meeting certain criteria, with their lenders to have some of the debt restructured.  There will also be options to allow families and individuals to remain in their own homes.  That is the crux of the issue for me.</P>
        <P>The major concern of the people we meet in our clinics and who contact our offices is that pressure was put on young people to take out huge mortgages.  The couch, the decking and the car were thrown in and now young families have been saddled with debt to be paid off in the next 30 years.  This can only be described as poor practice by the banks.  When I first went to obtain a mortgage, I was told I would rent a room in my house.  There is not a huge or thriving rental market in Abbeyside, Dungarvan, County Waterford, as we do not yet have a university.  There were inappropriate practices which put pressures on ordinary everyday people.  Banks faced with the prospect of non-payments know they must engage with borrowers.  In my experience, the banks are doing what they are supposed to be doing on paper.  They enter into a MARP, mortgage arrears resolution process, agreement with borrowers but lump more arrears on top of it which puts the payment completely out of the reach of the borrower.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement are specifically designed, as far as is practicable, to facilitate a debtor&rsquo;s continued ownership and occupation of his or her principal private residence unless the debtor does not wish to do so.  We do have a duty to ensure the language used in the legislation is distilled down so that people will know what it means to them.  Part of our role in this debate is to use accessible language.  While I accept there needs to be legalese and words are chosen carefully when drafting legislation, people need to be able to filter out the provisions that affect them.</P>
        <P>The Bill introduces three new non-judicial debt resolution processes.  The debt relief notice will allow for the write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three-year supervision period.  The Bill provides for a debt settlement arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt over five years.  The personal insolvency arrangement will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million, although this cap can be increased with the consent of all secured creditors, and unsecured debt over six years.</P>
        <P>The Bill outlines several avenues that can be pursued by people in debt.  The inclusion of both secured and unsecured debt, through personal insolvency arrangements, is seen as placing Ireland to the forefront of states seeking to address the devastating impact of unsustainable debt by providing for settlement arrangements of both types of debt at the same time.  It must be remembered that unsecured debt of credit cards and cheap credit is a significant burden to many families across the country and causes much stress.</P>
        <P>Labour has consistently and clearly promised that it would introduce legislation to assist those struggling to pay their mortgage, deal with their credit card debt or other personal debt.  This legislation is delivering on this promise as outlined in the programme for Government.  It is not, however, a blanket debt forgiveness scheme.  It has been put in place for those making an honest effort to pay their debts but can no longer afford their repayments.  A key principle of the Bill is that it is not about the size of the debt but rather the affordability to service it.</P>
        <P>There is no one-size-fits-all solution and each case will be dealt with on an individual basis.  The legislation addresses the obligations of debtors and the rights of creditors in a proportionate and balanced way while taking into account the financial reality of individual circumstances.  I look forward to working with the Minister and my other colleagues in government to ensure the speedy passage of this Bill so its provisions can assist the many families across the country affected by debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill before the House today.  This is possibly the most important legislation that we will pass in this House over the course of the Government&rsquo;s lifetime.  It will deal with the appalling legacy of the previous Administration and highlights how banking regulation must be of paramount importance.</P>
        <P>The Personal Insolvency Bill establishes a non-judicial debt settlement system and sets up an independent body called the insolvency service to oversee this system.  It also radically reforms the length of bankruptcy from 12 to three years.  I commend the Minister on bringing this landmark legislation before the House and taking action on the debt crisis which affects so many people.  It is a complex and radical reform of our laws governing debt and bankruptcy and, in so doing, forms one part of an overall solution that we are working on to deal with the problems of unsustainable debt, be it mortgage or personal.</P>
        <P>The debt levels experienced by people are leaving them feeling vulnerable and unsure as to how they can cope.  Many are especially concerned as to how they are going to keep up with their mortgage repayments, thinking that if they fall behind they will lose their family home.  As we know a man&rsquo;s house is his castle.  These people are the backbone of our society.  They are the ones who have worked hard and grafted but, because of the economic downturn, now feel isolated and alone in their struggles to try and meet their financial commitments.  They are real people facing real problems, often not able to see a way out of the predicament in which they find themselves.  They are in a suspended state of animation of debt which has a paralysing effect on the mind and soul.  These are the people who are in dire need of our help and this Bill will help.  It will not solve the problems on its own but it will play an important part in setting up a debt resolution process.</P>
        <P>One mainstream bank recently disclosed that the percentage of its mortgages in arrears of 90 days or more continues to rise and is expected to continue to escalate into next year.  Years of reckless behaviour by the banks have led this country from a period of relative prosperity to one where international financial help was required to help us out.  Once the economy hit the slowdown and people started losing their jobs, then the real pressure became evident.  People were faced with loans they could not pay back and mortgage repayments they could not meet.  We have all heard the horror stories from our constituents.</P>
        <P>The Personal Insolvency Bill is one part of the solution.  Our programme for Government stated we believe more protection is needed for home owners with distressed mortgages and it invokes a process of putting people ahead of the banks and the developers.  Indeed, Labour&rsquo;s manifesto stated it was an absolute priority to keep people in their own homes.  However, we must offer protection for those who cannot pay, not to those who will not pay.  Blanket debt forgiveness is not on offer.</P>
        <P>When passed into legislation, the Personal Insolvency Bill will introduce three new non-judicial debt resolution processes.  These will depend on the circumstances of each case.  Those finding it hard to pay their debts will meet with a personal insolvency practitioner who will then mediate the best way forward.  I agree with Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan that we should resist abbreviating that title to PIP as it would not convey the importance of the job.  I would suggest the excellent Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, be also actively involved in this process.  However, and this is key, there must be engagement from both sides in this process for it to work to the maximum effect.</P>
        <P>There will be a debt relief notice to allow for a write-off of qualifying debt, subject to a three-year supervision period.  There will also be a debt relief arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt over five years.  There will be a personal insolvency arrangement for the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &euro;3 million, although this cap can be increased if both parties agree, and unsecured debt over a period of six years.</P>
        <P>The success of the Bill depends on the interaction between borrowers and lenders.  I call on both parties to be as open and honest as possible in order for this incisive legislation to work.  I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, on the introduction of the mortgage to rent scheme, which, in conjunction with the Bill before us, will further ease the financial burden on so many families throughout the country.  This scheme will also allow people to resolve their financial difficulties and remain in their family homes.  I again commend the Minister for Justice and Equality for introducing this innovative Bill, which is part of the solution required to get the country back on its feet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Many thousands of families and households have been eagerly awaiting the Bill before the House.  I welcome the fact that we have at least been presented with legislation in order that we might engage in a debate on the most important issue facing the 70,000 or so people who are in mortgage arrears, those whose homes are in negative equity and individuals who are experiencing severe distress as a result of personal indebtedness.  As already stated, those to whom I refer have been awaiting legislation to deal with the problems they are experiencing.  Many of them are in impossible, even unsustainable, situations.</P>
        <P>The stakes are very high for the people in question, namely, those who are at the sharp end of the crises relating to mortgage arrears and personal indebtedness.  However, the stakes are also high for our entire society.  The scale of the mortgage arrears, mortgage distress and personal indebtedness to which I refer is probably one of the key reasons that recovery, growth and demand in the wider economy are being smothered.  People who are at their wits&rsquo; end trying to pay off mortgage or other debts &mdash; they really cannot afford to do so &mdash; are obviously not going to be in a position to spend much money in shops, retail outlets, etc., which are crying out for customers and which are going out of business at a rate of knots.  Everybody in the country has a stake in resolving this problem in a fair, just and sustainable way, to provide some hope and relief to those who are in trouble and to lift the massive burden of debt that is smothering the economy.</P>
        <P>In so far as it at least proposes to establish some sort of system to deal with indebtedness, insolvency and mortgage distress, the Bill is welcome.  As a result of its introduction, we will now have an opportunity to examine and debate all of the issues relating to this gravest of problems with which we are faced.  Having said that, however, my difficulties with the legislation begin almost immediately.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service does all Members of the Houses a great service by producing Bills digests.  It is both interesting and telling that the digest of the Bill before the House begins by referring to the context of its introduction.  The context set out by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service is the need to update the legislation relating to personal insolvency due to the fact that the current system is wholly inadequate and, in fact, virtually non-existent.  The digest also states that laws which stipulate that people must remain bankrupt for 12 years are extremely punitive in nature and just do not fit the current situation.  In so far as the digest puts this forward as the legislative context in which the Bill is being introduced, this is true.  However, the digest misses out on the fact that we are faced with a bigger and more immediate emergency which does not really have anything to do with a failure to update legislation and which came about as a result of the extraordinary behaviour of the banks, mortgage lenders and developers and of the political class which facilitated them in pumping up a property bubble.  Those to whom I refer were driven by greed and when the bubble they created burst, it literally crashed our economy, ensuring that tens of thousands of people were left in the kind of desperate circumstances to which I refer.</P>
        <P>The Bill, in both its provisions and its general thrust, does not acknowledge the extraordinary circumstances that led to the creation of the crisis in which we find ourselves.  What we are doing here is not just updating legislation for the modern era; we are required to take emergency measures to deal with an absolutely remarkable situation that developed in this country between 2002 and 2008.  In my opinion and, I suspect, that of many others, the victims of the crisis were not at all responsible for its creation.  The normal rules and provisions of insolvency legislation, regardless of whether they are updated, are not actually the issue here.  This is not a case in which people who borrowed too much and should have known better find themselves in trouble, obliging us to enact legislation to give them a second chance.  Insolvency legislation is normally supposed to deal with such eventualities.  However, we are not dealing with those eventualities.</P>
        <P>I accept that we need legislation to deal with insolvency, and this Bill at least moves us one step in the direction of dealing with the types of situation that can arise at any time.  However, we are not dealing with such situations; rather, we are dealing with a specific crisis involving exceptional circumstances that were created by a golden circle of bankers, developers and politicians.  The Bill before the House fails to deal with that crisis because it does not acknowledge the crucial and informing context I have outlined.  Even though it is not directly relevant to the Bill, it is important to note that the crisis to which I refer has been massively exacerbated by huge increases in unemployment &mdash; brought about, of course, by the financial crisis created by the golden circle of bankers, developers and politicians.  One could add the ECB to that golden circle, particularly in the context of its policies on interest rates, etc.  Increases in unemployment have compounded the effects of the financial crisis and made them even more disastrous in nature.</P>
        <P>If the Bill were to acknowledge the existence of the crisis to which I refer, it would stipulate that we need to take emergency or exceptional measures in order to write down the debts that were incurred by those who took out loans in order to put roofs over their heads or deal with the circumstances that prevailed in the period 2002 to 2008.  The people to whom I refer are the victims of a crisis that was created by others, and they took out mortgages that have proven to be utterly unsustainable.  All these individuals were trying to do was to put roofs over their heads, but they were doing this in a market that was rigged.  If we were acknowledging that, we would allow mortgage debt that was incurred during that period to be written down to current market values, or at least to pre-bubble levels.  Then we could start to consider what was reasonable borrowing and what insolvency mechanisms should be put in place.  There is a bigger context, however.  The crisis resulted from what went on between 2002 and 2008.  The situation people found themselves in at that time was not of their own making.  It has landed us in a catastrophe, just as it landed them in a catastrophe.  In my opinion, the portion of such debt that was artificially created by the greed of a few should be subject across the board to a system of debt write-down or forgiveness.  I would not include in such a scheme those who were involved in obvious speculation for greed in the commercial property area, or who bought large numbers of properties to rent out in the hope of making a killing in the market, or who speculated on continuously rising property values during that period.  I do not believe such people deserve any forgiveness.  Some people were doing nothing more than trying to put roofs over their heads, which is a perfectly legitimate thing to want to do at any time.  They took out loans that subsequently turned out to be unsustainable because they believed that if they did not get on the ladder at that time, they would never be able to do so.  Such people deserve our forgiveness, if that is the right word because it is not as if they did anything wrong.  The portion of their debt that relates to the bubble period should be written down.</P>
        <P>I will give the House an example of a better legislative model that we should adopt.  The legislation that was introduced in Norway after a similar property crisis in that country in the mid-1990s puts the Bill before the House to shame.  The Norwegian insolvency legislation had three main elements, all of which are lacking in this Bill.  First, a guarantee of the right of the home owner to his or her home &mdash; to be housed in his or her own locality &mdash; was written into the Norwegian legislation.  It was not left up to the banks, made subject to negotiation or suggested that it might or might not happen.  It was written into the legislation that the chief imperative of the laws of the state was that people should stay in their own homes.  It provided that people were entitled to decent quality housing in their own localities.  Second, the Norwegian personal insolvency arrangements defined what &ldquo;a reasonable standard of living&rdquo; was, something this Bill does not do.  The various arrangements proposed in this legislation will allow the lender or mortgage holder a reasonable standard of living, when such an arrangement is established, but they do not define what that entails.  What do we think the banks, which will have a veto, will consider to be a reasonable standard of living?  We can be pretty sure they will push for the standard to be very low, perhaps along the lines of our level of social welfare.</P>
        <P>The chief imperative for the banks will be to get their money back.  That was confirmed to me by the heads of Permanent TSB in the last hour or so at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We asked them about the priorities of the bank when it deals with people who have distressed mortgages.  We heard lots of noble words of concern about the plight of people, etc.  When they were pushed, they said their mandate is to protect the capital base of the bank.  That is what we heard explicitly in finance committee just now.  That is what the banks we have recapitalised are interested in.  They see the protection of their capital base as their chief priority.  They do not want to protect the right of the home owner to his or her home, or to a reasonable standard of living.  They want to protect their capital base.  That means the pressure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not do that in the last decade.  We need them to get the money they are owed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>They have always been interested in protecting their profits.  There is no change in that regard.  This legislation will give the banks a veto.  The pressure will always be on them to get as much as they can, even if it does not leave the borrower with a reasonable standard of living, or with his or her home.  Any proposal that is made by the borrower or the personal insolvency practitioner can be vetoed by the bank.  The bank has the whip hand.  This Bill will not enshrine in law the supreme right of the householder or borrower to a roof over his or her head in his or her own locality, and to a reasonable standard of living that is properly defined.  In Norway, the independent assessment agency, which is called the &ldquo;personal insolvency practitioner&rdquo; in our legislation, has the whip hand.  That body can impose a resolution on the bank.  The bank does not have a veto in Norway.  An independent body decides what is a reasonable arrangement for the repayment of a loan and what is reasonable standard of living.  It has as an imperative the requirement to try to keep a roof over the person&rsquo;s head.  It can impose a settlement on the bank.  That is the critical difference.</P>
        <P>Under our proposed legislation, if borrowers or householders are not happy with what banks are proposing to impose on them, the only choice they will have will be bankruptcy, which will involve losing their homes.  They will be able to walk away after three years, but they will have lost their homes.  We should not say that losing one&rsquo;s home and enduring three years of bankruptcy is a cakewalk.  It is better than 12 years, but it is not a cakewalk.  It is not an option that people will take up easily.  In light of the chief culpability of the banks in creating this crisis in the first place, why does this Bill give the banks the whip hand?  It is even more extraordinary given that we are recapitalising the banks.  We really need to tease this out.  I hope it happens during this debate.</P>
        <P>When representatives of Permanent TSB were at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform just now, I asked them about their relationship with the Government.  We have recapitalised Permanent TSB.  We are the main shareholder &mdash; the only shareholder &mdash; in Permanent TSB and the main shareholder in AIB, etc.  When we debate what the banks are doing, having been recapitalised, we are told the Government is not very happy with the way they are doing things &mdash; how they are treating customers and what they are doing with standard variable mortgages, etc.  There is an implication that there is nothing we can really do about these matters because the banks decide the policies.  Perhaps we can say things to them, but we cannot determine their policies.  That is how things are presented to the public.  We are told about the terrible and nasty banks.  I asked the chief executive of Permanent TSB about his relationship with the owner of the bank, which is the Government.  He said he meets the chief stakeholder &mdash; the Minister for Finance &mdash; every month.  Who is telling who what to do in this relationship?  If the Minister for Finance is meeting the heads of Permanent TSB on a monthly basis or very regularly &mdash; I presume the same thing is happening in the cases of AIB and Bank of Ireland &mdash; why are we as the major shareholders not telling the banks what to do?  Are we telling the banks what to do?  If we are not happy with how the banks are dealing with distressed mortgage holders &mdash; we should not be happy &mdash; why are we not telling them to change their policies?  If we are not happy with how they are dealing with standard variable mortgages, why are we not telling them to do it differently?  The Government should answer these questions.  This legislation essentially puts responsibility for dealing with this &mdash; the biggest problem &mdash; at one remove from the Government, on personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and insolvency agencies with no teeth.  Ultimately, it gives the banks the whip hand and says they can veto anything.</P>
        <P>I am not at all happy with the details of this legislation.  People only qualify for debt relief if they have a disposable monthly income of more or less &euro;60.  That is very restrictive and is essentially saying that, unless one is absolutely poverty stricken, we will not provide relief on personal indebtedness.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, major and radical amendment of the Bill is necessary.  The only good thing is the recognition by the Government that we need a system to deal with insolvency but we need to radically amend the Bill to take the whip from the hand of the banks and to put, as the central imperative of the legislation, the need to keep a roof over the heads of ordinary householders who borrowed under extraordinary circumstances created by the greed of banks and to ensure people who enter those arrangements are left with a reasonable standard of living that will allow them to re-engage with, and contribute to, society and not be smothered in debt for years or decades.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, Dara Murphy and Tom Barry.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage.  The importance of Second Stage is that it provides people with the opportunity to make general comments.  I agree with only one point made by the previous speaker, that this is undoubtedly a complex area of law.  The people who are to be beneficiaries of this do not need simplistic, will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp solutions thrown around like snuff at a wake.  Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp solutions brought this country into the hames it is in now.  To pretend there is a simplistic, abracadabra solution to personal insolvency does no justice to those who will hopefully be the main beneficiaries of the measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>They did it in Norway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickODonovan"><NameTxt>Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>No one interrupted Deputy Boyd Barrett.  If it was easy to introduce it in a certain jurisdiction, it is a pity the previous speaker did not use the experience of that jurisdiction to introduce a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  There has been no attempt by anyone in opposition to introduce any proposal on personal insolvency.  On that basis, I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Since Deputy Shatter became a Member of the Oireachtas, it has become clear that his knowledge of the protection of the family is second to none.  Those studying to become solicitors know that Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s <i>Family Law</i> is one of the foremost authoritative texts on Irish family law.  Who better to have in a position of protecting the family home than someone who is the foremost authority on family law?  It is important that this restores some semblance of hope to those who have had their hopes shattered by the main institutions of the State in terms of banking, regulation, administration and governance.  People have been failed on all fronts.  Previous speakers have gone into detail on what is included in the Bill.  Families come into my clinic, and to other Deputies&rsquo; clinics, and they do not have the wherewithal to get from Monday to Friday.  They are at their wits&rsquo; end and their hopes have been dashed.  They have been left with huge debts and an inability to pay back debt.  Banks and everyone else are breathing down their necks.  The measure before the House and the measures introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, with regard to mortgage to rent schemes, show the commitment to dealing with personal debt and the protection of the family home in the programme for Government.  This commitment must be recognised by Members on all sides.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to this is evident in the fact that there is no guillotine on the Bill, which will be debated late tonight, and that Committee Stage will be taken when we resume.</P>
        <P>I have concerns that the service should be rooted in the community and should not be aloof.  I compliment Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan because there is a temptation to focus on acronyms, such as PIPS and PSAs.  The people who will ultimately have the debt hanging around their necks do not care what acronyms are used.  They want to know who the person is and whether they can trust them.  They want to know whether the person they will go to for advice and assistance is tainted by the process that got us into this mess.  As a State, we will never be able to move on from the past 14 years until we see some semblance of justice for the hundreds of thousands of families left in dire straits.  This may involve bankers, other people or those who held political office and who failed the State being brought before the courts to be held to account.  Until we get to that point, legislation such as this will only take us part of the way.  We need the cleansing process to ensure we do not go down the same failed road as we came out of.</P>
        <P>MABS is a trusted organisation and has its roots in every part of the community.  It is accessible to people and speaks the language understood by ordinary people in difficulty.  It is proven to be confidential and trustworthy in its dealings with people.  It has a role at the lower end of debt but when this Bill is being fleshed out on Committee Stage, the organisation may have a greater role to play.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is a temptation in this House, particularly in the past few minutes, towards opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake.  If this was as simple as some people suggest, it would have been resolved long ago.  The fact that it is so complex and involves so many Departments means that compliments are due to the Minister.  I wish him well in its implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Dara Murphy for facilitating me.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on his pioneering, comprehensive and realistic legislation.  He has a major record as a legislator and this Bill adds to it.  In congratulating him, I also congratulate the Government on this important legislation.</P>
        <P>Listening to Deputy Boyd Barrett brings one into a fantasy world and makes one think that life is so easy, that money grows on trees and that there are simple solutions.  On Committee Stage, I would like Deputy Boyd Barrett to tell us where he sees the additional taxation to accrue the moneys necessary to provide debt forgiveness.  Where will he source the money, who will pay it and how will he administer the taxes?  Does he foresee this money as additional to the &euro;10 billion of tax he cited as desirable in next year&rsquo;s budget during the referendum campaign?  If it is not additional, where will the &euro;10 billion of additional taxes be placed, on whom and by what process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about time he started to answer such questions.  This legislation is vital to overall macroeconomic recovery in this country because it is necessary to get stability and normal spending going.  Until people give a realistic proportion of their income back as repayment on overborrowing, there will not be spending, confidence and disposable income in the economy.  It is a crucial part of the overall Government strategy to bring back the economy.  Getting this matter resolved in the coming months will be central to that achievement.</P>
        <P>The major advantage of the legislation is not so much its specific provisions, although I will attempt to deal with them in the time available to me, but the fact that it will create conditions where creditors and debtors will be facilitated to enter into realistic discussions.  The incentive for creditors is that they will have a resolution option which avoids bankruptcy on the part of the debtor, for the new shortened period of three years, out of which they are unlikely to gain anything.  The advantage to debtors is that they will have access to a process whereby agreement can be reached on their using a realistic portion of their income to discharge their debts while retaining sufficient to sustain a reasonable standard of living.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct in pointing out that the banks were rescued by taxpayers and remain heavily subsidised by them.  As such, there is an onus on the banks to forge imaginative solutions that will accommodate the large numbers of people in difficulty.  They must bring forward a range of products that will allow customers to reorganise their finances and recover their financial standing.  In fact, the financial institutions have several obligations.  They must work to restore their own well-being, as well as fulfilling their moral responsibility to their debtors and to the taxpayers who are subsidising them.  To do so, they must bring forward products that are realistic, accessible and useful.  The importance of this legislation is in its efforts to facilitate them in so doing.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out three types of debt restructuring agreements that will be available to people according to their needs.  The purpose of the debt relief notice arrangement is well charted in the Bill and will be realistically targeted.  We have had some nonsense talk in this Chamber to the effect that it should be made available to any person with debts above a certain threshold.  While consideration should be given to restructuring debts, where people have sufficient income to meet their financial obligations, they should and will remain obliged to do so.  These provisions should only be available to those who genuinely cannot pay.  The debt settlement arrangement for unsecured debt and the insolvency arrangement offer a degree of flexibility over time to persons struggling with serious debt.  I urge the Minister to include financial advisers as well as accountants and solicitors in these provisions.  Once their bona fides are established, people with expertise and a track record in dealing with such matters should be deemed fit to act as intermediaries in the process.</P>
        <P>The success of this Bill will not be so much in its implementation as in the fact that it will create the conditions where all parties will take a more sensible and realistic approach in dealing with unsustainable debt.  Anything which reduces the likelihood of such matters ending up in the courts will surely be welcomed by all.  I reiterate my plea to the financial institutions to respond to the legislation with imaginative products.  Taking a realistic approach whereby people are required to pay a reasonable and sustainable portion of their income is in the creditor&rsquo;s interest.  If the banks engage in the process in a reasonable way, it will have knock-on benefits for the whole economy.  Such an approach makes sense in macroeconomic terms, in terms of restoring individuals&rsquo; personal circumstances and in terms of restoring banks to profitability.  The speedier the process and the more realistic the terms of individual agreements, the more likely it is that they will work.  There is no advantage to creditors or debtors in having unsustainable arrangements that are likely to collapse after a few months.</P>
        <P>There is no avoiding the inevitability that some people will seek immorally to deny and renege on their debts.  No quarter must be given such people, who make up a very small minority of all those in difficulty.  The vast bulk of people are earnestly seeking to address their situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important legislation and commend the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, on his impressive work rate in bringing it forward.  Some days ago in this Chamber, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin sneered at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion that he and his Ministers are seeking to clean up the mess created by Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  This Bill is another chapter in our efforts, since coming into government some 18 months ago, to undo the damage done by the previous Administration.  The latter failed completely to address the situation whereby people seeking to enter bankruptcy or being forced into bankruptcy faced an extremely punitive discharge period of 12 years.  Moreover, the vast majority of those now facing severe financial difficulty are in that position because the last Government utterly failed them.  I note there is no representative of the main Opposition parties in the Chamber at this time.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>The previous speaker suggested there could or should be some type of panacea for the difficulties confronting people as a consequence of unsustainable debt.  There was never any suggestion from Government that this legislation would solve everybody&rsquo;s problems or even provide a complete solution for any individual.  What it will do is provide a starting process whereby  people can begin to normalise their relationships with the institutions and businesses to which they owe money.  In recent years we have seen a significant departure in terms of how banks deal with people who fall into difficulties.  Several bank managers have pointed out to me that negotiating power has been removed from local banks.  This was done because an unfair degree of blame was assigned locally for the excessive lending that took place.  We still have a very strong network of local staff and managers.  The banks should be encouraged to incentivise local managers to sell pensions and insurance policies, for example.  These people have a history and relationship with their customers which should allow them to negotiate in a productive manner.  Staff in branches throughout the country are willing to examine matters in a fair and educated way.  One of the main aspirations of the Bill is to differentiate between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  That knowledge already exists within the bank network.</P>
        <P>In regard to debt relief notices, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett very much misrepresented the situation in his references to an income of &euro;60.  Many people in the country, even those who are working and couples that have two salaries coming in, could easily arrive at a situation where they are left with a disposable income of &euro;60 after paying for utilities and other commitments.  It is not as restrictive as it would appear.  I am sure colleagues would agree that a significant number of those who go to public representatives in serious distress have loans of less than &euro;20,000.  A loan is not onerous by virtue of its amount; it is onerous by virtue of whether the person concerned can afford to repay it.  The new arrangements will offer relief to a significant number of those in debt.  I appeal to the banks to engage proactively in the process.  We all have a job to do in encouraging people to participate in the debt relief procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  The issues of debt and bankruptcy have been examined for many years.  The current bankruptcy period of 12 years is a lifetime and much too long.  Unfortunately, it has taken the current hard times to have the matter addressed.  The proposed bankruptcy period of three years makes much more sense than the current position.  I welcome the proposal to have debt relief provided on the basis of knowledge rather than any form of favouritism.</P>
        <P>I will focus on debt relief notices as they will affect more people than the debt settlement arrangements.  The debt relief notices will be available to those with unsecured debt of less than &euro;20,000 and will be provided in cases where people have a disposable income of &euro;60 per month.  All incomings and outgoings of a household will be assessed to arrive at their disposable income.  The legislation provides that those who avail of a debt relief notice must be left with a reasonable standard of living.  This is an important provision because it gets to the nub of the issue, namely, that many of the people we consider to be financially secure wake up every morning tormented by financial worries and a belief that they may not get through the following week or month.  This is an extremely dangerous situation.</P>
        <P>A debtor who wishes to avail of a debt relief notice must submit a written application, including a written declaration of all incomings and outgoings, to an approved intermediary who will go through the applicant&rsquo;s affairs in detail.  The comprehensive and fair assessment process set out in the legislation will lead to the drawing up of a prescribed financial statement providing for a resolution for persons who do not have any prospect of clearing their debts within five years.  This process allows people to see light at the end of the tunnel.  This is the key element of the Bill because many individuals and families do not have hope and without hope, a solution is not possible.  The co-operation of everyone involved is required for this process to succeed.  I note the Bill provides for co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and all Departments.  This will ensure no one can cite a lack of co-operation among public service bodies as a reason for the process not being completed properly.</P>
        <P>The debt relief notice process takes into account future changes in a person&rsquo;s circumstances.  For example, if a person receives a gift of more than &euro;500 or his or her income increases by more than &euro;250 per month, half of the additional sum will be allocated to the insolvency service.  If an individual who avails of a debt relief notice wishes to take out an additional loan, he or she must notify all relevant parties that he or she is in this process.  There is no point foisting high cost options on people who can barely afford to put food on the table, and this process provides a low cost option for debt relief.</P>
        <P>The debt settlement arrangements will apply to those with unsecured debt of more than &euro;20,000.  Under these arrangements, the debt will also be relieved within a five year timeframe.  I commend the Minister on his approach to this issue because his Bill goes to the heart of the debt problem.  Banks will be required to take a much more prudent approach to lending and to be cognisant of the legislation.  They will not be able to railroad people.  Instead, they will be required to deal with debtors properly with a view to rectifying the mistakes made by the debtor and bank.  There are always two sides involved where debts arise.  If the banks refuse to deal with people properly, the debtor may avail of the debt settlement option.  This is a sensible means of getting everyone to work together.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for giving this matter much time and consideration.  People should read the Bill because in the years ahead people will recognise that it provided a basis for a comprehensive solution to the many problems people now face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this Bill forms part of the State&rsquo;s commitments under its agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund under which to Government agreed to &ldquo;introduce legislation to reform the personal debt regime to the Oireachtas before the start of the summer recess, with the objective of increasing the speed and efficiency of proceedings while at the same time mitigating moral hazard and maintaining credit discipline&rdquo;.  The Bill does not quite achieve this objective as it falls down in a number of areas.  None the less, it is an attempt to tackle the issue of personal debt and, with the appropriate amendments, I am sure we will be able to meet the required objectives.</P>
        <P>One in seven mortgage accounts in the Republic of Ireland either has been in arrears for more than 90 days or has been restructured with less than the contracted monthly mortgage payment being made.  The country clearly has a debt problem.  Last week, I watched a panel discuss rent allowance on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; programme.  The discussion crystalised for me what type of serious debt problems we have.  It has been suggested that moving everyone out of landlords&rsquo; properties and into empty houses would solve the problem of rent allowance.  Given that 93,000 people are in receipt of rent allowance, even if the average mortgage on the 93,000 properties held by landlords who rent to rent supplement recipients were only &euro;100,000, moving everyone out of these properties would leave a &euro;9.3 billion hole in the banking system.  It is obvious that something needs to be done soon about debts that people cannot afford to repay.</P>
        <P>Under our current draconian bankruptcy rules, which involve a bankruptcy period of between five and 12 years, approximately 30 people are declared bankrupt every year.  By comparison, 60,000 people are declared bankrupt every year in the United Kingdom, which has a population of 62 million.  When one considers that the population of the Republic is 4.6 million, one finds that the UK bankruptcy rate is more than 500 times higher than that of Ireland.  Immediate change is needed.</P>
        <P>Virtually all the Deputies who spoke referred to people in serious financial difficulty visiting their clinics.  We have also heard about the high number of suicides, many of which are connected with financial problems.  Like many other Deputies, I grew up in a house where money was short.  This places people under severe pressure and they do not have the energy to develop, enjoy their lives or do good in the community.  People who are worried about whether they will lose their house or do not know if they will be able to put food on the table find it difficult to go on.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Law Reform Commission published an extensive study into comparative approaches to personal debt.  In its 2009 consultation paper, Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, and its final report in 2010, the LRC made a series of recommendations for legislative reform.  A key conclusion of the consultation paper was that Irish personal insolvency law was outdated and ineffective, particularly when compared with other European countries.  The paper states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Irish law, unlike the vast majority of its European peers, does not therefore provide access to an adequate and effective personal insolvency system, as required by the Council of Europe&lsquo;s Recommendation on legal solutions to debt problems.  The Commission therefore takes the view that a new personal insolvency regime must be urgently introduced in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears, the Keane report, which was published in October 2011, also recommends reform of personal insolvency legislation.</P>
        <P>FLAC, the Free Legal Advice centres, has broadly welcomed the Bill.  The organisation&rsquo;s director general, Ms Noeline Blackwell, stated: &ldquo;While the Bill is only for those who are unable to pay their debts in full, it will also help people who need a bargaining chip with their creditors.&rdquo;  However, she also expressed concerns about the imbalance of power between banks and debtors and noted that the Bill preserves the creditors&rsquo; veto in respect of the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement options.  The reason for FLAC&rsquo;s concern is clear when one considers that banks and debtors have a veto over the arrangements provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>They literally have a veto over forgiveness.  The very people who got us into this mess in the first place are the same people who will decide whether a person will be let off.</P>
        <P>A previous speaker said the banks are also to blame.  The reality is the banks are far more culpable than the individuals who took out the loans.  People had to take out such big loans because of the lending policies of these banks.  In a town like Castlerea, where I am from, no one wanted to pay &euro;200,000 for their house.  They had to pay so much because they were competing against developers who got tax incentives.  As a result, prices went up.  The fact there seemed to be unlimited credit from the banks and the fact they did not know when to stop giving the credit caused the problem, especially in a country where the majority of the people never had two pennies to rub together in the first place.  When the banks throw money around, the temptation is to take it, particularly when there is no choice.  Now the whole edifice has collapsed, the banks must take responsibility.  The fact that 65% of creditors must give the thumbs up before anything is done is hardly fair and does not make sense.</P>
        <P>One of the prime reasons for so much money flooding into the economy was the ridiculous arrangement put in place when the euro became our currency.  We ended up with the same interest rates as Germany, regardless of the suitability of the arrangement.  It certainly made no sense over the last decade.  When we needed something to dampen down the economy, we had to put up with interest rates that were used to drive forward the German economy.  To say that the people who took out the loans are partly to blame might be true to an extent but they only carry a very small proportion of that blame.</P>
        <P>Earlier a Deputy asked where we would get the money from to help these people.  I was under the impression the banks were stress tested and in that stress testing, they were supposed to take these debts into account.  With one in seven unable to keep up their mortgage payments, it was obvious this was coming down the line.  The banks were recapitalised to the tune of &euro;9 billion to deal with this but apparently it is now unrealistic to address the problem that way.</P>
        <P>I found two interesting points in opposition to this legislation on the namawinelake blog:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he person seeking bankruptcy must be able to demonstrate that they will not be able to pay their debts over a five-year period.  According to the Bill &ldquo;it is his or her opinion there is no likelihood of the debtor becoming solvent within the period of 5 years commencing on the date of the making of the declaration&rdquo;.  So if you are a mortgage-borrower with six months of arrears today and a property which has declined 50% from peak, on what basis can you demonstrate that you will not be able to become solvent in five years?  Obviously, it will depend on the future direction of house prices and there is no guidance given in the legislation as to how future asset prices might be determined.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Anyone who can tell the price of a property today is some genius, given property that cannot be sold cannot be priced.  How a person will know the value in five years time is beyond me so how is it practical to use that measure?  The blog continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he person seeking bankruptcy must be able to demonstrate that they have co-operated with their mortgage lender for a period of at least six months and that they have not agreed to any alternative arrangement.  The Bill says &ldquo;the debtor has made a statutory declaration declaring that he or she has co-operated for a period of at least 6 months with his or her creditors who are secured creditors as respects the debtor&rsquo;s principal private residence in accordance with any process relating to mortgage arrears operated by the secured creditors concerned which has been approved or required by the Central Bank of Ireland and which process relates to the secured debt concerned and that notwithstanding such co-operation the debtor has not been able to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the secured creditor concerned, or that the secured creditor has confirmed to the debtor in writing its unwillingness to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">In other words, notwithstanding the fact that you are hopelessly insolvent with massive negative equity, your bank can seemingly stop your bankruptcy bid by providing you with temporary relief on your monthly mortgage commitments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am no expert but I can read and what I have read about this points up serious flaws.  The banks have the last say, the very organisations that recklessly lent money to people and encouraged them to take more by releasing equity.  Now we are all in a heap and people are killing themselves over their debts, what happens?  The banks are given the whip hand once more.  They are the king and always will be the king in this country as long as we have right wing governments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KevinHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly agree with Deputy Flanagan that over recent years we saw reckless lending by the banking sector and it has not yet taken responsibility.  It arose in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform this afternoon when the CEO of Permanent TSB said there would not be any witch hunt.  There seems to be a witch hunt of those in debt instead of those senior executives who recklessly lent money.</P>
        <P>I welcome this broad and comprehensive legislation and thank the Minister for the diligent work he has done on this, along with the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its painstaking work and the staff who worked very hard in recent months to get this Bill before the House so quickly.  This is a radical reform of our bankruptcy laws and is one part of the many solutions on which this Government is working to deal with the problems of unsustainable mortgage and personal debt that affect households and act as a drag on the domestic economy.  Like Deputy Flanagan, we have seen people with mortgages or business loans struggling with unsustainable debt.  The proposals in this legislation will help people to start working on a way forward.  It is a major step towards fixing the problems this country faces.  This Government has delivered across a broad range of measures: renegotiating the bank debt, yesterday&rsquo;s stimulus package and investment in key infrastructure, the action plan for jobs, the credit guarantee scheme and anti-corruption legislation the Minister will introduce.  There is, however, more to be done.  We urgently need an overhaul of the HSE and the constitutional convention in the autumn will start to build confidence in the economy, society and public services.</P>
        <P>The priority of the Labour Party is to keep families in their homes.  We are starting to deliver on this commitment.  It must be remembered, however, that the provisions in this Bill have consequences for the people concerned and they must not enter into them lightly.  I urge anyone looking at this to take serious advice.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that a five year review period is far too long.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously a review of the entire package within two years to ensure it is working as intended and that people are seeing benefits.  The Minister has changed the personal insolvency agreement from ten years to five but if the debt relief notice, the debt settlement arrangements and the personal insolvency arrangements are not working after two years, they will not work at all.  I ask the Minister to look at this much more quickly than five years and to revisit it within the first two years.</P>
        <P>The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, has done excellent work in the debt relief notice area for many years.  It has ploughed a lonely furrow with FLAC, helping people with unsustainable debt.  The limit of &euro;20,000 is too low; it should be increased to at least &euro;30,000 if not &euro;50,000.  FLAC has published some excellent proposals on other specific issues related to debt relief notices and I ask the Minister to consider them carefully.  It makes no sense to push the many people who are dealing with the MABS and have debts greater than &euro;20,000 into seeking debt settlement agreements under which they have to engage a personal insolvency practitioner.  The MABS has a good deal of experience in the management of small but unsustainable debt and has in place a national infrastructure and good governance procedure.  People trust it and it has a long record in communities.  We do not need to redesign the wheel in this case.  The MABS has a strong role to play and I call on the Minister to consider expanding the areas in which it can work.  Perhaps this might be considered on Committee Stage.  I call on the Minister to examine how the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, are regulated and how their fees are set.  This issue should be examined on Committee Stage also.  This is an excellent piece of work which is long overdue.  I look forward to this package of laws passing through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurSpring"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Spring</NameTxt>
	<P>We should consider how this legislation will play out overall and the consequences of negligent lending.  Three Deputies have just emerged from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  If we learned anything today it was that banks were finally starting to acknowledge that the form of lending pursued over a long period, especially mortgages, was negligent and that negligence must have consequences.  We have also learned that the ESM will come to the rescue of the country at some level.  The way this plays out will be down to the ability of Ministers, the Government and the ECB to listen to how we want them to solve the banking crisis.</P>
        <P>The cost of funds to the banks remains too high.  If we can change this in such a manner that the ESM can shore up the cost of funds and bring it down low enough, variable rate loans and tracker mortgages will not cost the taxpayer money in the future.</P>
        <P>Before anyone tries to find out how he or she can avail of the Personal Insolvency Bill, I encourage him or her to watch and see how it plays out in the banks, whether any of the mortgage debt will be parked, whether there will be further reductions in variable rates and how the Government will pursue the Bill with a view to keeping people in their homes.  The last thing I want to see in the case of personal insolvency brokers or trustees is for expenses to be incurred by a person who is technically bankrupt for the purposes of negotiating with banks or people whom he or she does not trust.</P>
        <P>My friend and colleague, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, has rightly pointed out that the MABS has played a great role in many towns and I have expressed this view to the Minister.  Much depends on the capacity of the MABS to negotiate with the banks, solicitors and creditors.  There may be a deficiency in some places when it comes to dealing with the legalities, but in such cases expertise can be hired in the private market and this could bump up the expertise of the MABS.  I would prefer to see the MABS dealing with the issue of insolvency and creditors and the proposed limit raised from &euro;20,000.  I worked in several financial institutions.  Many of my constituents know this and have come to me seeking financial advice and for me to negotiate on their behalf.  I welcome the development of the Personal Insolvency Bill, but I cannot underestimate what the MABS has done for people to date.</P>
        <P>If the sole purpose of personal insolvency trustees is to try to provide a job for themselves, I remain fearful.  I fear this will cost the State money and that there will be an unacceptable lack of transparency for taxpayers and the general citizen.  The comparability of a personal insolvency trustee is unbeknownst and will be determined behind closed doors.  People will be resting on their laurels in the belief others will negotiate on their behalf.  They will not get the same deal as the person next to them.  Of the people who have approached me with financial troubles, no two have the same problem.  I am keen to see the details of the Bill established as soon as possible, especially the costs of the PIPs, who will pay for them and what the terms of engagement will be.  There must be arm&rsquo;s length engagement.  I have no wish to see the first cousin of someone else dealing with someone in a bank in a small town, as that could lead to problems further down the line.</P>
        <P>The credit unions must be protected.  They have many loans under the amount proposed and we should not encourage people to seek the assistance of the Bill for the purposes of damaging the credit unions.  It is encouraging, if somewhat ironic, that Moody&rsquo;s believes this will affect the banks.  Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s also believes this legislation raises concerns for the banks also.  Still, the banks have been capitalised and I hope this legislation will be to the benefit of the people.</P>
        <P>As I know we are breaking up shortly, I wish everyone a nice recess.  I hope I will not bump into anyone here for at least one month.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for bringing forward this legislation.  I realise it is at the request of the troika because it is part of the recovery programme.  Ireland, which I love, became insolvent.  For the past four years it has struggled on a life-support machine.  Deputy Arthur Spring stated the banks were the engine, but they were also the main contributors, owing to lax or there being no supervision, and the conduits of the financial tsunami that caused great destruction.  They have been brought through the life-support process into something of a zombie existence, but their customers remain under the cosh.  Today one of the banking institutions, not one of the two large banks but Permanent TSB, came to explain its position and how it was trying to create a live bank from the carcass.  Recently the Minister for Finance suggested he did not know what to believe when it came to being briefed by and getting reports from the banks.  That is the truth of the matter.  Despite this, the legislation expects that the customers of banks will do everything under the three alternatives in terms of a full confession, written and oral, of the full extent of their assets and liabilities.  Regardless of this, even today, we do not know the position of the banks.  Am I not right?  We have asked about their income, provisions and categorisation of their assets, but it is still fuzzy.  This is not on.</P>
        <P>I thank those involved in the MABS because they have been on the battlefield, mostly at the lower levels of debt.  Every week at least five constituents come to me with detailed stories of their positions.  The financial slavery ahead of them is abhorrent and appalling.  It is wrong that they cannot engage with lenders.  We hear the phrase &ldquo;the banks will engage&rdquo;, but the are not doing so.  They are directing their customers and pushing them around like slaves on tea trolleys, which is wrong.  We need to consider the fundamental road to well-being and the recovery of the country at every level.  This applies not only at the lower or middle levels of income but also at the top.  This society from top to bottom is having a financial nervous breakdown.  We are on the right road and pointed in the right direction with the Personal Insolvency Bill.  I congratulate those responsible in the Department where there is so much happening.  The staff should be thanked for their long hours of work and diligence.  At the same time, there is no point in facing in the right direction if one can never reach the destination.  That is my concern.  We must look at this Bill, and not be afraid to shorten the timescale of bankruptcy in the larger cases and to be rigorous about those who carry out the negotiation and the intermediation between lenders and borrowers.  I would also make it much more imperative that the main creditors, especially secured creditors, are brought to heel in this because they acknowledged today that the ten years leading up to the collapse were of their own architecture and execution.  It is all wrong to think that the borrowers and counter parties of that situation should be enslaved for the next number of years and we must do something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister and his staff on their enduring work in the arduous process of getting to this point.</P>
        <P>I am reassured that Deputy Mathews is doing constituency work.  I, too, every week meet people coming into our offices.  These are genuine ordinary persons who did not make a fortune, who did not go berserk but who now are in trouble.  They are living in fear.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mathews used the word &ldquo;slavery&rdquo;.  There is a new modern form of slavery in society which is called personal debt.  That is having a profound effect on the quality of life of ordinary citizens.  It has a significant impact on the social and economic life and the mental health of the nation.</P>
        <P>I hope this Bill is the beginning of the journey to reclaiming the country and allowing people to be able to live without fear.  There are so many today who are afraid to go home because they are unemployed, they have debt or they are bankrupt.  They are afraid to talk to their wives.  That is the impact on the quality of life.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mathews is correct.  I pointed out in the House previously that the banks are telling us lies.  They are codding us up to our eyeballs.  They come out with these great advertisements on television and radio, they bring us into briefings and they meet us to tell us all they are doing and all the money they are giving out, but they are making it impossible to work with people.  The banks must recognise that we require people to spend money to do up their houses and to buy houses and small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to employ and act as a stimulus in local economies.  Unless we wake up to the reality in this country, we are heading towards a continuation of the spiral of insolvency and debt.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the debate on this Bill.  In many ways, it is the statue to 14 years of the boom and bloom of which former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, <i>et al</i> told us.  This is the legacy they leave.  This is their monument to where we were under their false voodoo economic carry-on.  That is why it is important that we move forward with this piece of legislation and others in a suite of measures that will assist citizens.</P>
        <P>We need resolution strategies.  We need, with the Central Bank and the other banks, to ensure there is a strategy to assist those who are in mortgage arrears.  It is imperative; it is critical.  Equally, we must recognise that this will take time.  This cannot be done in the space of a five hour debate or in the passing of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Personal Insolvency Bill will, I hope, act as a catalyst to the banks to work with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases.  The protection of the family home is the person&rsquo;s priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I must speak about MABS as Deputy Spring has done.  MABS has built up a considerable database of contacts and of approaches which must be utilised in the future.</P>
        <P>There is an expectation that the Bill is the panacea, roadmap or answer to all ills.  People have felt a sense of hopelessness and of being let down and forgotten.  There is now an insolvency Bill building upon other measures that can offer a way forward.  Given that we are in a challenging economic environment and given that there is a Government that has gone to Europe, made the change and created a different approach in the domestic economy, we continue to commit to the protection of people.  One size does not fit all.  We must recognise we need entrepreneurs but we also need public services and must protect people.  I hope the Bill will be the catalyst to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a massive body of work.  It is complex and it is hard to know where to start.</P>
        <P>It will be significant.  If it works out well for the people and the State, no doubt it will be a considerable boost for Ireland.  A few years ago we could not have imagined that the problem with debt in the country could be so bad.  There probably has not been anything like it in the history of the State.  Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan stated: &ldquo;Not all economic crises have left as substantial a legacy of personal debt as has the current global crisis.&rdquo;  It is difficult how one gets around to dealing with it.  I would not for one minute say that it is easy to solve or that it is easy for the Government to come up with all the right answers.</P>
        <P>As always in debates like this, there will be much repetition and, obviously, I will make points others have made too.  People have asked me, because of my business over the years, whether it is a good time to buy an apartment or a house.  I have always been of the view that we probably will not hit the bottom of the market until we deal with the significant problem of negative equity and the considerable personal debt problem that is so prevalent.</P>
        <P>Starting with the debt relief notices, I note that MABS, which definitely has its finger on the pulse and knows what is going on in this country, states that it would only facilitate a maximum of 15% of its present clients.  Seemingly, MABS deals with 30,000 cases a year.  It seems that the majority of those looking at it are of the view that it would be a positive move to increase the threshold to &euro;30,000 from &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P>The debt settlement arrangements and the personal insolvency arrangements are a significant improvement on what there was because what there was has really not been of any service.  This is a step in the right direction.  I would be wary that it looks a little bureaucratic and if it is too bureaucratic, people will take the easier option.  People often have the option of throwing their hands in the air and walking away.  This is happening at present and we will see more of it.  I am firmly of the belief that if we can regulate negative equity and impossible personal debt, it will be better than allowing a disorderly situation to prevail.  How the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements will work out may prove less bureaucratic than I fear, and I hope that will be the case.  It will be good if the maximum number avail of this arrangement rather than just throwing in the keys or throwing their hands in the air in despair.</P>
        <P>Like most Members, I am worried about the veto given to the banking system.  I have looked at what the Europeans have done in this regard and I do not see any other country where the lender has quite as much power as we are giving to our banking institutions.  I have had too much experience of dealing with banks in the past five years to even start talking about it here.  However, I am not the only one who is afraid they might not behave in as ethical and fair a manner as we might like.  To be fair, I would not say every bank or every bank branch behaves poorly because they do not all behave the same.  I have been treated fairly by some banks and I feel I have been treated unfairly by others.  However, I would prefer if they did not have this veto over the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements.</P>
        <P>The reduction of the bankruptcy term from 12 years to three years is a positive development, although Members might say &ldquo;He would think that, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;, given that I might be declared bankrupt one of these days.  The term is one year in America and Britain and some have advocated that the same would apply here also.  I do not agree and I believe the Government has got it right with the three-year term.  The creditor needs to be protected too.  If I had &euro;10,000 in my pocket and someone wanted a loan of that, I would like to get that money back, so there must be protection for the creditor.  The period of three years is about right and to set it at one year would have been to go too far.</P>
        <P>The change in the term of bankruptcy from 12 years to three will also be a boost to entrepreneurship, which is very important if we want to create employment.  People have to be able to take risks.  Of course, they get shot when the risk does not work out very well, but it is very difficult for people to create employment in this country without taking some risks.  It is great when it works out, and it does work out much of the time, although not always.  If a banking crisis arrives and cuts the value of sites tenfold and the value of property by at least 50%, it can be challenging.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I have had people from the Socialist Party and the People Before Profit Alliance lecturing me on business of late, telling me how I should be doing it and what I should have done or should not have done.  It is difficult to take lectures from people who never employed anyone in their lives.  Many of them never did a day&rsquo;s manual work.  It has been a bit nauseating.  I am too well aware of how challenging it is in business, although I am not going to start looking for sympathy.  In any case, the period of three years is about right for bankruptcy and the change is a positive move for the State.</P>
        <P>Speaking of bankruptcy, a very interesting statistic is that the average millionaire in America today has gone broke three times but, of the millionaires who have gone broke in a recession, only one in ten has ever gone broke again.  Recessions are very educational, and people in business learn a lot from them.</P>
        <P>Having read up on this issue before the Bill was published, I thought there might have been some change to the regulation of debt collection.  I have had some negative experiences with sheriffs coming to look for their piece of meat.  The present arrangement is not very good.  For some strange reason, those we have encountered seem to be of a bullying nature, very aggressive and not afraid to kick the door in.  They do not seem to behave in a very regulated fashion.  Their biggest priority is getting their &euro;470 call-out fee, and the person does not even get a receipt for that.  The sheriff is prepared to negotiate on everything else, however, and it is a matter of trying to stop him from taking the equipment.  A friend of mine was cutting a fellow&rsquo;s hair while the sheriff was looking for the seat he was sitting in, and he threatened to bring it out the door, only it would not fit.  It is not right.  I know of cases in which they have gone into farms in the middle of the night and taken stuff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not.  People should not be allowed to enter a farmer&rsquo;s property in the middle of the night and take machinery or anything else.  That should not happen in a civilised society.  Some serious thought should be put into the regulation of debt because things can be done in a much better fashion.</P>
        <P>While I will not get to address all of the issues, I would like to draw attention to the case of Norway, which I found very interesting.  Norway faced a debt crisis among private households in the early 1990s, mainly caused by rising unemployment and a fall in housing prices.  Norway was and is a land of homeowners, with more than 80% of dwellings owner-occupied.  In the most exposed areas, houses and apartments lost 50% to 80% of their value.  This happened very quickly, particularly in the larger cities.  At the beginning of the 1990s, it was roughly estimated that up to 100,000 households were having problems fulfilling their obligations and many of them feared losing their homes.  Selling was not a way out because the prices that were attainable were far below the money lent to buy the houses and, of course, there were very few buyers.  Many individuals and families lost their life savings almost overnight and many found themselves severely indebted as well.  All of this arose from the fact that, in the late 1970s, the Norwegian Government had strict regulations on credit interest rates but the creditor regulations became less effective due to the availability of credit from foreign sources and the growing so-called grey market.  In 1994, the Norwegian Government deregulated the credit markets, which caused a significant increase in bank lending.  There were certain restrictions on financing but credit was requested by more and more consumers.  The Norwegian Government also eased the regulations on owners of co-operative dwellings, the price of which increased along with the co-operative owners&rsquo; buying power.  This also led to a higher demand for owner-occupied dwellings.  The Norwegian Government then lowered capital reserve requirements and decreased bank supervision.  This was the beginning of the Norwegian house price bubble.  It sounds so familiar due to the similarity to our own situation, and it is a pity we did not find out about it earlier.  I should have studied the history of banking and the history of money, which goes back over 500 years and which I have been reading about over the past three years.  I am sorry I did not understand it better before then.  In Norway, if a house was bought for, say, &euro;300,000, they valued it at current prices and if that was &euro;150,000, they decided on a figure of &euro;150,000 plus 10%, which is another &euro;15,000, making a total of &euro;165,000.  For the next five years the person would have to pay the interest on it at whatever the rate at the time.  If the person did not break his or her commitment to pay the interest on a monthly basis for the five years, that &euro;165,000 minus what the person had paid in interest over that five years, became their new mortgage.</P>

        <P>Before we get out of the hole we are in we will have to engage in some form of debt write-down.  I know it is difficult.  The main argument put forward on many occasions is the moral hazard argument but as many others have stated, far be it for the banks to talk about moral hazard given the way they have behaved.</P>
        <P>In general, if the structure the Minister is putting in place could be a little more flexible and more attractive for people it will be a positive move and will produce greater results.  This is a huge item of work, and I acknowledge it is far from easy for the Minister.  The Bill is a start.  Obviously, the bank veto is very worrying but at least it is a start and I hope we can improve on it in time.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister, who is responsible for the Bill, has spent a good deal of time listening to speakers and to reviews of the Personal Insolvency Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  It will be remembered for many years as major reforming legislation introduced by this Government.  I thank the Minister and his staff, specifically the people in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Parliamentary Counsel who have done a huge amount of work on the Bill in a short period.  They worked under extreme pressure to get the Bill published before the summer, and it is welcome that it will be in the committee over the summer recess.</P>
        <P>This is welcome legislation.  The Bill directly addresses problems faced by people living across Ireland who went through the period of boom to bust.  I have no doubt it will affect a huge number of people ranging from those who engaged in very low levels of borrowing to those who engaged in very high levels of borrowing.  As public representatives every Member of this House will know people with personal debt, mortgage debt, business debt, personal loans and credit card loans.  It affects thousands of people across the country who are in any sort of arrears.</P>
        <P>On a daily basis people come into my office who are struggling to pay their mortgages or personal debts.  People want to pay their mortgage, and they will almost go hungry to pay their mortgage.  There are then those who can afford to pay their mortgage but will not pay it.  They believe there will be blanket debt forgiveness in that regard but I hope people understand that this Bill is not about blanket debt forgiveness and looking after people who can but will not pay.</P>
        <P>A great deal of what is contained in this Bill follows on from the recommendations in last year&rsquo;s Keane report.  There are some very good recommendations in the Keane report.  The flexibility of the Bill can be seen in three different mechanisms used to deal with the personal debt element: the debt relief notice; the debt settlement agreement; and the personal insolvency agreement.</P>
        <P>I welcome the reduction in the term of bankruptcy from 12 to three years.  That will make bankruptcy a more functioning option than the current under-used alternative.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wallace spoke about the behaviour of some of the banks.  People in my constituency have come to me, and I have no doubt they have gone to Deputy Wallace and other public representatives in my county, and told me about bank bailiffs calling in the middle of the night and taking machinery out of people&rsquo;s yards because they are unable to make their repayments to the banks.  I refer to some of the well known banks like Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  On occasion people with criminal records, acting on behalf of the banks, have gone in and taken machinery from people and harassed them and their families.  Nobody should be treated in that way.  We need functioning banks, and I understand they have to make profits, but there are ways and means of doing their business with and for the people.  People did not get that type of reception when they went to the bank looking for the loan.</P>
        <P>A huge number of people have fallen into bankruptcy through no fault of their own and must remain in that position for 12 years.  Very good business people who had viable businesses have fallen into bankruptcy because they were not being paid for the services or goods they provided.  This Bill addresses that problem by reducing the period of bankruptcy from 12 to three years.  If we are to turn around our economy we need those people who have fallen into bankruptcy back in business and creating jobs.  They are often the people who will take the risk, and they have the brains for business.  The Bill brings the bankruptcy period within the norm of the European standards.</P>
        <P>I have been calling for this legislation through my role in opposition and in government.  This is a troika commitment but it is an issue the Government wants to act upon also because if we are to get out of our current circumstances, this Bill will do that.  It is an important step for us to modernise the bankruptcy law in that it will provide an incentive for the banks to co-operate with those people in arrears.</P>
        <P>I was elected to this House in 2002 and even in that boom period there were people who were unable to pay their mortgages but that situation is becoming more prevalent every day.  As a public representative I recall going to local banks on occasion to negotiate with the customer but that no longer happens.  The banks will not even listen to people.  They refer them to personnel in their head office in Dublin or wherever.  They do not even know the personal circumstances behind the case about which one is talking.</P>
        <P>This Bill is designed to ensure that homeowners will have every opportunity to remain in their home.  It is not about taking their homes from people.  People&rsquo;s homes are their castles which they have built up over years.  They are where they reared their families and created memories, and they want to remain in them.  This Government wants to give that person every opportunity to remain in their family home.  People deserve that, especially those who want to pay their mortgage and who will make every effort to pay their mortgage.</P>
        <P>People are travelling around the country telling people not to pay the household charge but at the same time they are criticising the banks for not negotiating with people.  This is a collective effort to get us out of the economic climate in which we find ourselves and if we are to do that we all must work together, Opposition and Government.</P>
        <P>There are people from the Opposition going around the country saying the household charge is an unfair tax, yet they are also telling the Government to pay their mortgage for them.  I find something very peculiar about people who are making an effort to pay their mortgage but will not pay their household charge.  I encourage anybody who is struggling with a mortgage, especially if they are in arrears, to engage with the lender.  If people engage with the lender, they can find a way to get out of their situation.  There is no easy solution to tackling mortgage arrears, but it is an issue that must be confronted if people are to remain in their homes.  I know everyone has their own difficulties and challenges.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and the people who put a huge amount of work into this Bill over recent months.  It is the most ground-breaking Bill that has been introduced in this House in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  This is very important legislation which has been eagerly awaited.  The drafting of the Bill has taken some time, but that is understandable given its complexity.  I compliment the Minister on presenting the heads of the Bill in draft format to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for debate.  This process gave an opportunity to the members of the committee and interested parties to give their views on the legislation at an early stage.</P>
        <P>Personal debt has become a major issue for many people in our country.  This legislation provides a framework under which it can now be dealt with.  The Bill establishes an insolvency service and provides for the licensing and approval of intermediaries and personal insolvency practitioners.  These intermediaries will play a key role in advising debtors, negotiating debt settlements and administering the terms of such settlements.</P>
        <P>I welcome the three types of voluntary debt settlement arrangements established in the Bill.  These are debt relief notices which deal with unsecured debt of less than &euro;20,000, debt settlement arrangements for unsecured debt greater than &euro;20,000 and personal insolvency arrangements, which will be for secured debt of up to &euro;3 million and other unsecured debt.  I would like the Minister to clarify the qualifications he envisages are necessary for personal insolvency practitioners.  Will there be a conduct of fitness and competency test for personal insolvency practitioners?  Will there be a licensing procedure for personal insolvency practitioners?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Over recent years, and indeed this week alone in my clinics, I have heard a number of real life stories of families who are struggling with their debt problems.  In many cases their lives lie in ruins and their marriages have often broken down under the stress and strain associated with the financial pressures they face.  During the so-called Celtic tiger era, people could not buy property quickly enough and the banking system fed and promoted that desire.  People bought houses off plans without even seeing the properties.  There was little or no oversight or financial regulation, and this created a perfect storm of unsustainable debt.  I very much welcome this Bill for that reason.  It provides a mechanism whereby people who have fallen into the black hole of unsustainable debt-  personal or mortgage debt or both &mdash;  are finally being armed with a means to navigate their way out of the deep problems they face.</P>
        <P>I want to recognise the role played to date by the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, in assisting families and people through their personal and mortgage debt issues.  It is a wonderful organisation which has gained the respect of ordinary people and lending institutions alike.  Its role to date cannot be understated.  Will it receive extra funding, given the extra caseloads it will receive as a result of the introduction of this legislation?</P>
        <P>Part 4 deals with the reform of the bankruptcy process contained in the Bankruptcy Act 1988, as amended.  In particular, I welcome the reduction of the length of bankruptcy from 12 years to three.  This change brings our State into line with other jurisdictions, is a welcome measure and, critically, will only come into play after a process of meaningful engagement and negotiation has failed.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction and offers a ray of light where previously there was none.  There is no silver bullet to debt resolution, but this Bill is welcome and I congratulate the Minister on his work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Bill, which will radically reform insolvency law in this country.  Many of our citizens will now be able to breathe a sigh of relief and begin to sleep soundly in their beds as a consequence of the introduction of this legislation.  We have all heard of the so-called new poor, people who are working hard but unable to keep their heads above water.  Many of them are savaged by debt, afraid to open their doors or read their post.  Theirs is an existence of dark isolation.  People burdened with unmanageable mortgage and personal debt cannot avail of the safety net of our social welfare system.  They have struggled to endure under the weight of their burden, with nowhere to turn for relief or support.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff of MABS who have offered a lifeline to people in desperate straits.</P>
        <P>A significant aspect of the Bill is the reduction of the discharge period for bankrupts from 12 years to three.  By changing the <i>status quo</i> so fundamentally, this legislation sends a message to beleaguered people who are worn down by the persistent and insurmountable nature of their debt that there is hope and that their lives are worth more than their debts.  People genuinely want to work their way out of debt and this Bill offers them a way to do so.  I particularly welcome the onus it will place on banks finally to take a realistic approach in arriving at debt settlement arrangements and workable solutions with individuals.  These are the same banks which offered 100% loans on overinflated properties, encouraged customers to finance car purchases by amalgamating the debt with their mortgages so that the payments were spread over 30 years, and offered increased credit card limits week after week.  Unfortunately, many succumbed to the temptation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the development of concepts and solutions by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, housing agencies, housing associations and various lending institutions.  Initiatives such as trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and mortgage to rent schemes offer the possibility that people can retain their family home while simultaneously addressing their debt obligations.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provisions allowing for non-judicial debt resolution processes, which represent a modernisation of our law.  I am sure the Minister has noted the recommendation by MABS that the limit of &euro;20,000 in respect of the write-off of debt under the debt relief notice process should be increased.  I urge him to consider increasing the limit for agreed settlements in respect of the personal insolvency arrangement from &euro;3 million to &euro;5 million to ensure we have a meaningful process.  The numbers facing this type of financial distress are not known because it is a private matter which people will only talk about as a last resort.  There are many in white collar professional jobs and many entrepreneurs who were running good enterprises but who are now left with defunct businesses due to the change in our economy&rsquo;s fortunes.  They have given personal guarantees and are up to their necks in personal debt.  An increase in the threshold to &euro;5 million would offer a realistic prospect of addressing a problem which they themselves are anxious to address.</P>
        <P>I have concerns in regard to what body will be authorised to make the assessment as to what is essential income for an individual to live on.  That can make all the difference as to whether we are offering a solution, because people have to live at the end of the day and we want them to be able to work this through.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned as to how personal insolvency trustees will be funded and paid.  I have concerns that such payment would not be necessarily or solely on a commission basis and that people would not be thrown to the wolves in that process.  I also compliment the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  One cannot underestimate the complexities involved in arriving at a correct legislative item that balances the need for people to pay their bills and dues when they can do so with providing people with a lifeline and a hope that in cases in which one will never be able to pay one&rsquo;s debt or bill, there is hope and a solution is at hand.  Such a solution may not be easy because ultimately, regardless of what anyone thinks, bankruptcy is not an easy road to take.  However, this is a solution and I greatly welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffinFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Griffin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Personal Insolvency Bill, which I welcome warmly.  It is a substantial and highly complex Bill and I acknowledge the huge amount of work put into it by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and his departmental officials.  It probably is one of the most important Bills to be introduced by the present Administration.  It has been good to hear so many constructive positions taken on this legislation by Members on all sides of the House in recent weeks.  Reform of insolvency law is long overdue in Ireland and some existing laws have been in place since well before the foundation of the State.  As a great deal has changed since then, this development certainly is welcome.  This Bill will, in law, provide a vital lifeline to many people and families nationwide.  I refer to those who effectively are drowning in a sea of debt at present and this legislation offers them a vital lifeline.  I welcome many of the measures contained in the Bill, particularly the new non-judicial debt resolution processes it will deliver.  In addition, in common with other Members, I welcome the conditional automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years, rather than the 12-year period that obtains at present.  As other speakers have noted, this will give people a second chance and is a reasonable measure.  I believe that expecting an economy to recover and to prosper with so much problematic personal debt attached is almost akin to expecting a football team to play well if all one&rsquo;s players are three or four stone overweight.  This simply will not happen and speaking from a County Kerry prospective, I tend to believe we know something about football.  Similarly, the debt problem has been strangling this economy for some time and this measure at least constitutes a move in the right direction.</P>
        <P>In addition, I acknowledge the role and activities of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, since the onset of the current crisis in particular.  I also acknowledge the positive development that a new office will open in my constituency in Killarney to complement the work being done in the Tralee office.  I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of counselling centres throughout the country, which have done a huge amount with those who find themselves snowed under with debt.  For example, having spoken to the people who run the SouthWest Counselling Centre, Killarney, I have been informed the centre is dealing with an unprecedented number of people who approach it when suicidal, extremely depressed, under pressure and anxious as a result of financial worries.  I encourage anyone who may read the Official Report of this debate or who may be watching it on the Internet to talk to and engage with services such as the counselling services and MABS if he or she finds him or herself in such a position.</P>
        <P>If enacted, this Bill will form part of the solution to Ireland&rsquo;s overall problems.  It will complement the jobs plan, the &euro;2 billion stimulus plan announced yesterday and various other existing incentives to business which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has of late been attempting to highlight in an effort to bring jobs for the people and to bring about economic recovery.  This legislation also comprises part of the process of getting credit flowing in the economy again because no proper capitalist economy can function without a ready supply of credit.  While, unfortunately, no proper availability of credit exists at present, this Bill forms part of the solution in this regard.  I reiterate my welcome for the Bill and look forward to hearing further debate on it as it passes through its various stages.  I again commend the Minister on the enormous amount of work that has been done in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  The main reason I wished to speak on this Bill is because more than 1,350 families in my constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim are in arrears of three months or more.  The position is the same in every other constituency and many such families now are in a dire situation.  Moreover, they now face into the months of August and September in particular, when the additional costs associated with returning to school will force many of them into further significant arrears.  Many more families have restructured their mortgages, with approximately half such families going back into arrears.  While examining the available statistics regarding those who are in mortgage difficulties at present, I came across a figure to the effect that each day, 85 families are falling into arrears of more than three months, which is a significant statistic in the current climate.  These families and thousands more are struggling to manage financially, even though more than &euro;6,000 million has been paid to the banks specifically to address mortgage arrears.  However, these families are now obliged to pay on the double because to date, the banks have not been prepared to engage fully with people in mortgage difficulties.  It is important to remember that last July, just one year ago, &euro;17 billion was provided to the banks, more than one third of which was targeted specifically to deal with the mortgage arrears.  Although the banks have the capacity to absorb some of the losses of distressed mortgageholders, to date this has not happened and they have not been prepared to engage on a realistic basis with many people in serious financial difficulty.</P>
        <P>While no one believes that mortgage dodgers should be bailed out, genuine cases arise all the time involving people who are in genuine difficulty and who need assistance and these are the people on whom Members must be focused in respect of this legislation.  It is welcome that at long last, the bankruptcy system in Ireland is being reformed because such a system exists to protect society from people who have become excessively indebted.  However, the present system is not working for either creditors or for debtors.  There is a need to reduce the bureaucracy involved with this process and to provide people who are made bankrupt with a fairer system in which they can discharge their debt and start to contribute positively again to the economy.  Bankruptcy should be a penalty for financial mismanagement but it should not be a life sentence for people.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember, especially in respect of mortgages, that there are two sides to this issue.  I broadly welcome the legislation before Members because it brings back some balance by placing some responsibility back on the banks.  It is important to remember it was the banks that shoved mortgages onto many young couples.  The banks shoved mortgages on them when they knew in their heart and soul there was no possible way in the long term that such people would be able to repay those mortgages were property prices to stabilise, let alone to collapse to the extent they have.  It is unfair that mortgaged families are the ones who have been obliged to bear all the burden to date in this regard.</P>
        <P>I note a mortgage arrears resolution process has been entered into by the banks, which were to use that process as a mechanism to try to address the difficulties of young families.  While I will revert to the mortgage arrears resolution process shortly, in October 2011 the Central Bank issued a requirement to each of the mortgage lenders to develop a specific strategy and to implement plans to deal with families in serious financial arrears on their mortgages.  Since then, however, the Central Bank has tried to force lenders to take a proactive and creative approach to dealing with troubled mortgage holders.  It has written to them several times, requesting that these plans be submitted, but it is only in the last month that the banking sector actually submitted plans.  That is nearly eight months after the Central Bank had requested the banks to do so.  Now we are being told that those initiatives will only be introduced on a pilot basis until the end of this year.  This means we are going to see something happen 14 months after the Central Bank requested the mortgage lenders to develop and implement a strategy to deal with distressed mortgages.</P>
        <P>The banks&rsquo; solution in the meantime was to introduce a mortgage arrears resolution process, but that has not worked effectively since then.  There has been a disclosure in the media that Ulster Bank refused to change the collection date to the end of the month for one mortgagor that would make it easier for the person to make the mortgage repayments.  Permanent TSB threatened the repossession of a mortgage holder because the person refused to set up a direct debit account, even though the person was meeting the revised payments on a monthly basis.  The reality is that 50% of the restructured mortgages have gone back into arrears again, so it is clear that the current process in place has failed to deal effectively with the problem.  It has only kicked the can down the road.  The banks are clapping themselves on the back for the new initiatives being introduced, but they are only pilot schemes and it will be the end of the year before any real steps are taken to deal with families who have significant financial problems.  That is why I am concerned about this particular Bill.  The banks are not being compelled to participate in the debt resolution process.  Based on the performance of the banks since last October, following pressure from the Central Bank, they have failed to live up to their moral responsibility.  Unless there is a stick approach to the banks in Ireland, they will fail again to live up to their responsibility.  They have been dragged kicking and screaming to the table to put a fair and balanced system in place.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives discretion to the courts, and that is a positive step.  Must of the Judiciary in this country are fair minded, and I believe that when it is clear in cases before them that the banks have not dealt with mortgage holders in a fair and reasonable process, especially when this Bill is in place, then the banks will throw out those requests for repossession.  Once a number of cases like that take place, the banks will reassess the situation on how they manage mortgages in arrears and families in severe financial crisis.</P>
        <P>A major personal debt crisis also exists.  Up until the end of last year, 315,000 ESB customers were behind with their electricity payments and had to engage in a special arrangement to pay off their debts in small instalments.  A recent survey carried out by the credit unions showed that 40% of householders have borrowed to pay their bills in the last 12 months, and 10% of those have gone to moneylenders to do so.  A quarter of Irish credit card holders are using their cards to make ends meet at the end of the month.  These are the real working poor in this country.  They are working hard, paying for the running of this country on a weekly and monthly basis, and yet they are entitled to absolutely nothing from the State.  These people are living in fear of the monthly bills such as ESB, phone and fuel bills, and they are living in dread of back to school expenses, Christmas, confirmation or holy communion.  These people are not entitled to any social welfare supports.  They are over the threshold for everything such as medical cards, back to school allowances and supports for holy communion and confirmation.</P>
        <P>People are being forced into financial difficulties due to the operation of our social welfare system.  An example of that is the family income supplement, which has to be renewed on an annual basis.  It takes up to three months to renew that application.  We are talking about people in work who are the poorest of the poor and whom the State recognises as being in receipt of an income so low that is not enough to meet their basic needs on a weekly basis.  To keep them in work, the State tops up their salary.  However, the State can leave them go for three months without a payment and hope they can live off fresh air, even though the State recognises that they do not have enough money to meet their basic needs.  Many of these people now being forced by the State into the arms of moneylenders, who charge up to 190% APR, due to the inefficiency in dealing with these particular renewal applications.  These should happen automatically.  People should get their payments and by all means they should be reviewed to ensure they are being made fairly.  However, it should not take up to three months and force people to go to moneylenders to make ends meet while they wait for the Department of Social Protection to decide they are in a low paid job and need that additional top-up payment to put food on the table and pay basic bills.</P>
        <P>It is important the Bill not only deals with mortgage arrears but also that there is some recognition in it of other difficulties in which people find themselves.  There needs to be flexibility on the write-down of debt, and I know there is an acknowledgment of this in the Bill, but more needs to be done.  The Bill deals with people who are unable to pay their debts in full.  There are many people who cannot pay their debts at the current level but who, with a level of write-down, could continue to make repayments and could get back to participating in the economy.  It is crucial that such people get back working in the economy.  Without their engagement in the economy, we are only undermining the possibility of the economy getting up and running again.  These people are the lifeblood of the economy because many of them were the entrepreneurs during the 1990s who created new businesses and jobs and as they have now fallen on hard times, they are up to their eyeballs in debt.  Unless they can get out of it, they will not be able to participate actively in the economy, create new businesses in the future and the additional jobs that will be the lifeblood of the economy.  I urge the Minister to take a flexible approach to try to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of those people who have found themselves in debt.  The point has been consistently made in the Law Reform Commission report on the reform of indebtedness that we need to support those people because they will be the drivers of the economy in the future.</P>

	<P>The previous debate on the personal insolvency legislation ties in with this debate on consumer credit.  I fully support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Bill and believe it should also be supported by the Government.  It is estimated that 200,000 people have borrowed from the 47 licensed moneylenders, as well as the illegal ones.  The largest sub-prime lender, Provident Financial PLC, lends to 100,000 customers in Ireland.  In 2009, 75,000 people had credit from Provident.  In 2010, it had increased to 88,000 and by 2011 it had reached 100,000.  It charges &euro;30 a day for every &euro;100 borrowed for six months, a horrendous APR of 187.2%.  Southside Finance Limited offers loans of up to &euro;100,000 for 26 weeks with an APR of 128%.  R&amp;P Credit charges an APR of 195% on a &euro;300 loan over 21 weeks.  These are the rates of the legal moneylenders.  Can anyone estimate the rates charged by the illegal operators?</P>
        <P>Illegal moneylending is becoming a significant problem.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul claims illegal moneylenders have mushroomed during the economic crisis with little action taken to curb their activities.  It is a scandal that thousands have been driven into poverty by the actions of the banks and the Government&rsquo;s continued austerity measures.  The rise in the number of people availing of Provident&rsquo;s services bears this out.  Due to the lack of available credit, it is hard for many people to get loans, forcing them to borrow from moneylenders and loan sharks for day-to-day needs.  The Government should hang its head in shame that people are being forced into such a position due to its continued austerity measures.</P>
        <P>The gap between rich and poor is also continuing to grow.  Recent figures from Social Justice Ireland show that the poorest families experienced an income drop of almost 20% in one year while the incomes of the richest increased by 4%.  Yesterday, when these figures were brought up with the Minister for Social Protection during Question Time, she fobbed it off claiming it occurred when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power.  However, Social Justice Ireland stated in its report that the Government&rsquo;s continuing austerity measures are creating this inequality.</P>
        <P>I support this Bill and I hope the Government will too as it is an opportunity to deal with the issue of predatory loan sharks.</P>

	<P>The only people who would seek funds from the lending institutions in question would be those without or who cannot afford bank accounts.  For the majority of those in such a position, it is not a choice but a matter of economic circumstances as bank accounts cost money.  These are the target group for sub-prime lenders.  They are also the most vulnerable in our society and are the ones who most need protection.  However, last night, the Minister of State told us that putting a generous cap on the interest charged by these institutions would close down the industry and lead to an increase in illegal moneylending.  There seems to be such certainty about this, so much so the Minister&rsquo;s speech could have been written by the likes of Provident.</P>
        <P>According to Bloomberg, Provident is expected to have revenues of $1.1 billion in 2013 and it aims to be the main provider of credit of &euro;65 billion to 10 million people in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Provident describes itself as a non-standard provider of home-delivered credit for unsecured consumers.  It sounds great but it really is just door-to-door lending and collection.</P>
        <P>All the Government&rsquo;s concerns seem to be towards the industry.  Industry used to have a more benign meaning &mdash; the dictionary definition was of a manufacture or a trade &mdash; but this credit area is a trade in human misery, particularly when one considers rates as high as 187% charged on loans.  This is in a Republic which is supposed to be government by the people for the people.  For whom though?  It is ridiculous no cap can be applied to the interest charged.  This Bill seeks to do that which is important as there is little point in sending people to agencies such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, if we do not deal with the cause of debt problems through such moneylending.  There is a precedent in this respect as credit unions have a cap on the interest they can charge.</P>
        <P>It is obvious there is an increase in personal debt levels which will result in more people being pushed towards this sector.  More will need protection from these lenders.  Why has this matter been a low priority for the Central Bank?  Why has it been a low priority for the European Union which regulates pretty much everything else?  Why is it such a low priority for the Government when clearly more people will require the protection provided for by this Bill?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnHalligan"><NameTxt>Deputy John Halligan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to concentrate on illegal moneylenders whom I can only describe as vermin, parasites and sub-human as they prey on the most vulnerable in society.  The amount of illegal moneylending going on is not documented enough.  Many of these illegal moneylenders are criminals which has been well-documented by RTE and other news reporters.  Over the past several years, it has become a growing problem in Waterford city as well as in other towns and cities.  These illegal moneylenders prey on the most vulnerable in society, those with no or poor credit rating.  More and more people are falling into their vicelike grip.  Ordinary citizens may require a financial dig-out at some stage in life.  It may be to meet expenses for a communion, confirmation or even a family bereavement.  Due to their credit circumstances they cannot go to the credit union or the bank for a loan.  Instead, they have no option but to deal with illegal moneylenders.  Moneylenders humiliate, harass and even threaten people when it comes to repayment.</P>
        <P>How many licensed moneylenders have been complained about to the Financial Regulator?  How many illegal moneylenders have been brought before the courts over the past two years?  I suspect none.  Those agencies that deal with those on poor incomes, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and MABS, state the problem of illegal moneylending is a significant issue in most cities.  It would bear well on us to find out if we have prosecuted any illegal moneylenders.</P>

	<P>That is unbelievable.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, to consider the pressure exerted on some people by moneylenders who are forcing those to whom I refer to go to their local post offices and withdraw their children&rsquo;s allowance to pay the money they owe.  People are also being harassed outside their children&rsquo;s schools and when they go shopping in supermarkets by thugs who can afford to drive around in cars with 2010, 2011 and 2012 registrations as a result of the vast profits they are making from moneylending.  As Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien stated, we have not prosecuted one illegal moneylender.  That is a shameful response on the part of society, legislators and the Garda.</P>

	<P>I compliment Deputy Pearse Doherty on introducing the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2012.  While I will not be supporting it, I recognise the spirit in which the Bill has been brought forward and welcome the opportunity it affords us to discuss the issue of moneylending.  This debate is important because it highlights the activities of moneylenders and the negative impact their activities can sometimes have on relationships and families.</P>
        <P>It should be pointed out that people are entitled to borrow money from whomever they want.  That is their right and we cannot stop them from doing so.  The problem with moneylenders, however, is often the lack of transparency in their dealings.  This is a matter which must be addressed.  What is of critical importance in the context of moneylenders is that people should be fully aware of the commitments they are entering into with them.  At times of economic hardship when people are often desperate, they may not be thinking straight and the possibility of quick and easy money can be a very attractive option that is difficult to resist.</P>
        <P>One of my main concerns with moneylenders is that the people to whom they are lending often may not have the wherewithal to understand the cost of the loan or the nature of the commitment into which they are entering.  In addition, they may not understand they will be obliged to pay a very high rate of interest which can often be in excess of 180%.  The details of the loan can often be explained to them in an overly simplistic manner.  For example, a person may be informed that a loan will only cost &euro;5 per week.  On that basis, he or she may be of the view that there is no problem and that he or she can afford to pay.  The problem is, however, that he or she must pay a huge rate of interest.  It must also be remembered that people often forget to examine the exact terms relating to a loan before they obtain it.  As a result, they end up paying money back over a long period and, in some cases, indefinitely.  That is why it is hugely important to ensure there is greater transparency of the way in which moneylenders sell their products.  There is no great emphasis among moneylenders on a duty of care towards their customers, whereas credit unions offer people genuine advice and are up-front with them.  Moneylenders do not seek evidence which shows that people can repay their loans and borrowers do not need to demonstrate an ability to repay.  That is what often leads to huge problems down the road.  This is a matter that warrants further examination.</P>
        <P>I have referred to credit unions.  The problem with them is that they can be reluctant to lend because they are now operating in an area which is highly regulated.  As a result, credit unions are sometimes left with limited scope for social lending.  That is regrettable because such lending has always been to the fore of the credit union movement.  In fact, the need for social lending was one of the reasons the movement was established in the first instance.  Credit unions are afraid to take undue risks by lending to people who cannot show that they are going to repay their loans.  A member of a credit union may have a particularly good track record but because of the need for compliance with current regulations and the very strong emphasis being placed on the ability to repay, if he or she cannot demonstrate repayment capacity, the credit union will often be afraid to extend a loan to him or her.  This often encourages people to go to moneylenders because it is their last resort.  It is important, therefore, that the Central Bank take cognisance of the fact that the social lending of credit unions can play a very important role in combating the negative impact which borrowing from moneylenders can have on families.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that credit unions cannot give out loans in circumstances where there is no chance of their being paid back.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether we like it, there is a demand for the service provided by moneylenders.  For one reason or another, there are some who have burned their bridges with their credit unions and cannot obtain credit elsewhere.  There are those who go to moneylenders for the simple reason that it is convenient to do so.  Moneylenders provide a quick and personal service and some individuals like this.  The fact is that if one obtains such a personal service, one must be prepared to pay a high price for it.  There are certain people who accept this fact and have no problem using moneylenders.  Ultimately, we must accept that moneylenders are providing a service that some people need.  There is no harm in this, but we must ensure people are fully informed before they enter into any agreement.  If a person needs a loan quickly and if he or she is prepared and able to meet the repayment schedule, that is fine.  However, we need to examine how certain individuals have fallen prey to moneylenders.  Those to whom I refer should be using the supports provided by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, when they fall into arrears rather than seeking the services of moneylenders.  The MABS will negotiate on their behalf and may arrange to take a deduction from either their wages or social welfare payments.  In addition, it can also set up arrangements with credit unions.  People must be aware that there are better alternatives available in order that they will not be obliged to pay the exorbitant interest rates charged by moneylenders.</P>
        <P>As stated, it is at times of economic hardship that moneylenders come to the fore.  Placing a cap on the rates they charge would be extremely dangerous because, as the previous speaker stated, this would only serve to encourage and promote the use of illegal moneylenders and thereby exacerbate the problem further.  It is welcome that the Minister proposes to engage with the Central Bank to develop guidelines which will provide greater transparency of the rates charged by moneylenders and address the issue of ensuring licensed moneylenders will not earn big profits on the backs of vulnerable persons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnLyonsLab"><NameTxt>Deputy John Lyons</NameTxt>
	<P>I jumped at the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill because I have quite a number of comments to make on moneylending.  I grew up in Ballymun and still live there.  As a result, I have first-hand experience of life in a family and neighbourhood where this is what people do if they want to borrow money.  I do not like to make sweeping statements, but I imagine there are many Members of this House who have never witnessed at first hand what it is like borrow from a moneylender.  The reality is that people do not borrow from them because it is an easy option.  For many, it is the only option.</P>
        <P>I am in complete agreement with the spirit of the Bill that has been brought forward by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  However, I would like additional information to be provided in order that we might discover the exact amount being made in profit by moneylenders in Ireland.  Is there, for example, concrete evidence which indicates that if we were to put a cap in place, licensed moneylenders would remain viable.  As a previous speaker indicated, if we were to introduce a cap and some of the licensed moneylenders withdraw their services as a result, people would be forced to go to illegal moneylenders and that would make matters worse.</P>
        <P>Everyone in the House will at some time or other have been obliged to borrow money to pay for Christmas presents or an event.  Those who borrow from moneylenders use the money they obtain for the same purpose.  However, some of them may borrow money to pay the for their TV licence.  In that context, they will be obliged to pay an additional &euro;100 on top of the &euro;160 it costs to purchase such a licence.  That is absurd.  The activities of licensed moneylenders are regulated, but this type of thing is still allowed to happen.  The difficulty is that those who borrow from moneylenders often have no other option.  It is fine to state if we give everyone access to a bank account, this will be the beginning of the end of moneylending.  I do not accept that.  It is part of the solution, but a suite of measures will be required if we are to deal with this matter once and for all.</P>
        <P>The culture of moneylending tends to be focused in areas in which there are high levels of disadvantage.  There are large numbers in Ballymun, Finglas and similar places throughout the country who rely on moneylenders as a last resort.  As Members are aware, those to whom I refer do their best to repay the loans they obtain.  The fact is that when people who may be on low incomes or on social welfare get into that cycle, they get into a poverty trap.  They might plan to spend a year paying off a loan they took out at Christmas, but if they need to get the house done up, or if a wedding or an unfortunate bereavement arises, they might not have paid it off by the time Christmas comes around again.  People can get stuck in that cycle.  We need to find some sort of solution to help them to get out of it.  Some people have suggested some ideas in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of such an idea.  My niece Rebecca received over &euro;900 when she made her confirmation a few months ago.  My sister took her away on holidays to Bulgaria the other day.  My mother told me that Rebecca had no money when she was going away.  My sister had said she would try to ensure Rebecca put a certain amount of her confirmation money away as spending money for her holiday so she would not be asking her for money when they were away.  None of the money was left, however.  I genuinely think children need role models so that they appreciate the importance of trying to save a bit of money when they have it.  We can all play a part in this longer-term solution.</P>
        <P>Having worked in a school, I am aware that there are some really good schemes in our schools.  This approach might not help people who are in debt now, but it will discourage those who have grown up believing one has to go to a moneylender if one needs money from getting involved in this activity.  Many banks, credit unions and post offices run schemes in secondary schools to show people how to save.  We are not necessarily talking about saving money.  The first time I ever saved was when I was in third class, when I handed over 50p and received a &ldquo;Cyril the Squirrel&rdquo; savings stamp.  Other Deputies probably did the same.  If one filled one&rsquo;s book, one would be able to get &pound;10 which could be placed in a bank or post office account.  That was my introduction to saving.  If there were more programmes of this nature, the number of people who do not know how to avoid debt problems would be reduced.  I do not suggest it would solve the problems of those who are currently in debt, however.  There are ways of stopping this cycle from repeating itself.</P>
        <P>The information available to me suggests that the imposition of a cap, as proposed in this legislation, would not provide the full solution that is needed.  If it did, I would be happy to support the proposal.  I wish we could consider a more substantial proposal that would address some of the matters that have been raised in this debate.  The reality is that those who engage in this form of borrowing have no other option.  Those of us who borrow in other ways do not have to go to moneylenders.  I remind those who participate in the debate on this issue that they are talking about real people with real lives.  They are trying to make ends meet and to do the best thing for their families.  That is what they want and what the rest of us want.</P>
        <P>I cannot support this Bill, unfortunately.  In the spirit of the proposal, I jumped at the opportunity to speak on it.  I commend Deputy Doherty on this initiative.  I hope we can find a more solid solution as part of a more comprehensive suite of measures aimed at addressing this issue.  The reality is that people are being penalised.  This country, despite the extent of its debts, is not having to pay the incredible interest rates these people are having to pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMitchellOConnor"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for introducing this Bill and highlighting the scourge of moneylenders.  A recent report claimed that one in 10 consumers has had to resort to moneylenders.  This is concerning in light of the exorbitant interest rates some people are forced to pay.  It has been claimed that people are being charged annual percentage rates of up to 287%.  There are 47 licensed moneylenders in Ireland at present.  The high number of unregistered moneylenders is most concerning.  Mr. Brendan Dempsey of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has said that such operators have mushroomed in recent years.</P>
        <P>Despite the reality that the registered and unregistered branches of this industry are thriving, nobody has been prosecuted for illegal moneylending in the last seven years.  I consider the penalties that are imposed on those who offer illegal moneylending services to be insufficient.  A person who is found guilty of illegal moneylending in the District Court faces a maximum fine of &euro;3,000, a maximum prison sentence of 12 months, or both.  A person who is found guilty of illegal moneylending in the High Court faces a maximum fine of up to &euro;100,000 or a maximum prison sentence of up to five years.  Given the level of APR that is levied by these companies, these fines do not represent an adequate deterrent.</P>
        <P>People must be encouraged to come forward and report illegal moneylenders.  Awareness campaigns conveying the dangers of engaging the services of moneylenders must be rolled out, especially at Christmas time when such companies target the vulnerable.  People are not just borrowing for a one-off life events such as christenings, communions and confirmations.  As a former school principal, I ask school managers to introduce a policy of allowing robes to be rented to communion and confirmation classes.  That would reduce the costs involved.  A survey that was conducted this year by the Irish League of Credit Unions found that 40% of people borrowed money to pay bills in the last 12 months.  Some 10% of the borrowers in question went to moneylenders to obtain loans, thereby entering a cruel and vicious cycle that can be almost impossible to beat.  There is no doubt that action must be taken this regard.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in terms of the rise of moneylenders and associated problems.  Short-term loans and pay-day loans becoming prevalent in the UK.  In 2009, it was estimated that credit amounting to &pound;1.2 billion was provided by way of payday loans in that country.  There is no limit on the amount of interest that may be charged on pay-day loans in the UK.  In 2011, the <i>Financial Times</i> noted that pay-day lenders had been attracted by Britain&rsquo;s relatively unchecked market.  The volume of such business has increased to approximately &pound;2 billion in the last four years.  We do not want people who are in dire straits to get involved in pay-day loans.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I acknowledge all of these issues, but I do not believe the Bill before the House provides an answer.  It does not address the complexity of the issues.  Moneylenders will not survive if they cannot charge rates above 40% APR.  They will be pushed into the unregistered and unregulated market.  I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on bringing the Bill before the House.  I am unable to support it, unfortunately, because I do not think 40% is a realistic figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty and his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues on giving us an opportunity to debate this difficult and complex issue.  The Deputy has done us a service in this regard.  When I listened to the examples given by Deputies Lyons, Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and others, it struck me that moneylending is an ever-present phenomenon across the country.  I do not think it is entirely confined to working-class communities, although I agree with Deputy Lyons that has largely been the case historically.  A feature of the recent recession has been that moneylending has found its way into the community more broadly than ever.  Deputy Heather Humphreys made the point that the need to borrow in this manner often arises from the difficult and traumatic circumstances people encounter when they burn their bridges with credit unions.  They might be unable to return to their local credit union because they have defaulted on a loan.  They might have tried to roll their liabilities over with new loans, only to find themselves trapped.  That is when people end up going to moneylenders.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>It is important for us to remember that moneylending itself is not illegal.  In fact, it is legal.  I do not disagree with those who talk about the need for prosecutions.  However, prosecutions should and can be brought only in cases of illegal moneylending.  It is important to remind the House &mdash; I am sure Deputies are aware of it &mdash; that moneylending is regulated in this country, even if it might not be sufficiently regulated.  We might need to do an awful lot more, for example by amending the existing legislation.  All of those points are well taken.  The impression is sometimes given that the criminal justice system should round up the moneylenders.  That is not the position we are in.  It is not illegal.  As others have said, people have the right to go to legal moneylenders and to borrow from them.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposal that the maximum rate that can be charged should be capped.</P>
      
        <P>On the face of it, most would say it is a good idea.  If we could make it so that people could get credit at the maximum level proposed by Deputy Doherty, I would have no difficulty supporting the Bill.  The difficulty is that introducing a cap is not without consequence.  This is the issue we must address.  The Minister of State was clear at the outset that a cap of 40% would mean &ldquo;moneylending would no longer be viable, licence renewals would not be sought and it would effectively close down the industry&rdquo;.  That is a stark statement by the Minister of State, which I must take at face value.  The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states: &ldquo;A balance however must exist between a cap which prevents lenders charging usurious rates whilst, at the same time, allowing companies to charge a rate that enables them to continue to trade while factoring in the level of risk involved&rdquo;, which is an acknowledgement by the proponents of the Bill that a balance must be struck.  I must take it seriously if the Minister of State judges that introducing this cap would essentially drive the industry underground and reintroduce the phenomenon of illegal moneylending.</P>
        <P>I would vote for the cap of 40% if I thought that by doing so we would achieve the ends we all seek to achieve.  However, I am not convinced.  Deputy Doherty gives an example of a high interest rate and applies the interest rate to a reasonable example.  He shows how a person would have to pay far less if the 40% cap applied and, on the face of it, that is true.  However, what if the person could not obtain a loan?  What if the moneylending agency did not exist?  In that case, the example given by Deputy Doherty falls away because the person is unable to borrow.  Deputy Doherty stressed that the introduction of the cap would have an immediate impact on tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of hard-pressed families.  If I thought we would achieve that end by supporting the Bill, I would do so with a heart and a half.  However, I must have regard to what has been said on the opposite side of the argument.</P>
        <P>The challenge for the Government and all politicians is to determine the better course.  We do not usually have the option of taking the ideal course.  This arises in respect of the insolvency legislation, the sovereign debt issue and where to make budgetary adjustments.  We cannot conjure an ideal for the people so politicians must take the better course.  In this case, better education and better and fuller regulation of the market is what we should do.  That is how we do least harm in this situation.  For those reasons, I cannot support Bill but I commend and congratulate the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for producing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Doherty for introducing the Bill.  I listened with great interest to the debate last night and tonight from Members on all sides.  I have raised this issue before and I have major concerns.  I have spoken about it on numerous occasions, including to the Minister.  Moneylending is as old as time and has become a tradition in some families and communities, when more conventional means of borrowing are not an option.  The reliance on moneylenders is causing havoc in communities such as the one I represent, where people are getting into huge debt with no prospect of being able to repay.  This also applies to people who had never before gone to moneylenders.  We know that most people turn to moneylenders when they cannot get a loan elsewhere.  Unfortunately, the trade-off for such quick access to a loan is the high interest rates charged.</P>
        <P>We must distinguish between legal and illegal moneylenders because many are licensed and operate within the law.  I have listened to the discussion on the interest rates for legal moneylenders.  High interest rates should be reduced and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is committed to approaching the Central Bank to speak about the issue.  The high interest rates are legal because, we are told, they could not operate a viable business otherwise.  A rate of 40% should not be the cap but rates such as 197% are totally unreasonable and must be addressed.  There must be a realistic approach to limiting the interest rate for those who must borrow from these sources.</P>
        <P>The real issue is illegal moneylenders, who all too frequently terrorise individuals and their families.  I dealt with a girl last year who was followed to the post office by the moneylender when she withdrew her children&rsquo;s allowance.  The moneylender waited outside to be handed the money owed.  It is a terrifying experience for the many people who experience it on a regular basis.  Where the traditional institutions are not an option, and when money is scarce, moneylenders are the only option for many people.  A speaker last night said that parents must educate their children and encourage them to save and not to borrow unnecessarily.  Sadly, those who go to illegal moneylenders do not have money beyond what is in their pockets.  Many struggle to put a dinner on the table at the end of the week.  If people do not have the money, they cannot save it.  Let us not fool ourselves.</P>
        <P>Very few people in this building have never borrowed money and it is wrong to say that borrowing and repaying money is confined to a certain section of people.  The only difference is their access to loans from banks, whereas those who go to moneylenders do not have such access.  How do we resolve the problem of illegal moneylending and how do we stop people getting themselves into massive debt?  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a responsibility to pursue illegal moneylenders but it is difficult for them because I have spoken to people who are terrified to identify illegal moneylenders.  It is difficult for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist when people are not prepared to come forward.  They are afraid of being harassed, of their children being harassed and of their homes being set upon.  Our focus must be to deter people from relying on moneylenders, whether legal or illegal.</P>
        <P>The only way forward is to provide small loans to those who need them and the credit union is an institution with the capacity to do so.  The role of the credit union when I was growing up was to be the people&rsquo;s bank.  It must continue to be the people&rsquo;s bank and give out small loans.  It should be the first port of call for families in need.  They need to open their doors and enable people on low incomes to borrow small amounts even if they do not have a good credit rating.  While I accept that ability to repay is very important, it is possible that the credit unions can work with the Department of Social Protection, MABS and other agencies to operate a system of repayment via social welfare payments to the credit union.  This would be an asset to those caught up in illegal moneylending.  We urgently need to help those who cannot deal with banks and offer options other than borrowing from moneylenders.  Last night the Minister of State said that all advertisements must contain the following warning in large font: &ldquo;WARNING: This is a high cost loan&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, many of those who must borrow do not read large or small font so, unfortunately, I cannot support the Bill.  However, I think the Minister will continue to try to resolve this matter.</P>

	<P>This is a modest Bill which seeks to cap interest rates on loans charged to the most disenfranchised and economically desperate of our citizens at 40%.  It should be remembered that the group which relies most on these types of loans is the working poor.  I am aware from my own constituency of Meath West that these are regular individuals who have suffered the consequences of the collapsed economy.  They are working reduced hours or have lost their jobs and are consequently caught in the debt trap.  These people should be protected and defended.  Other speakers have agreed that it is unacceptable that rates can be set at X, Y or Z, but they will not go so far as to vote for a cap to be imposed.  It has been claimed that the imposition of a cap would drive lending underground.  The State has decided that the best way to deal with the drugs issue is to make them illegal and their sale a law and order issue.  Surely driving illegal moneylenders underground will make their activity a law and order issue which can be dealt with as such. </P>
        <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, outlined the Government&rsquo;s response to our proposal, a response that is endorsed by the Labour Party.  Since I was elected to this House I have heard it repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, by members of that party in particular, that Sinn F&eacute;in is a party of negativity, bereft of any ideas as to how the country should be run.  This motion is the latest in a series of reasonable and progressive motions that we in Sinn F&eacute;in have brought forward in Private Members&rsquo; time, every one of which has been opposed by the Labour Party.  It has opposed Sinn F&eacute;in motions to safeguard Moore Street, where James Connolly lay injured before giving up his command.  It has opposed our motions to retain services at Roscommon hospital and to repeal the household charge.  The Labour Party that marches proudly on May Day opposed Sinn F&eacute;in motions of support for schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme.  Our motions to withhold the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note and to safeguard State assets were rejected.  The Labour Party, a party of the left, has likewise opposed our motions to reverse cuts to community employment schemes and to retain the ESB in public ownership.  Now the party which owes its political DNA to Larkin and Connolly is opposing a modest Sinn F&eacute;in motion to curtail the excesses of moneylenders.  As the D&aacute;il session draws to a close, one has to question the role of the Labour Party in government.  How can it claim to have remained true in any way to its legacy and principles?  The party has sided with commercial landlords to maintain upward-only rents.  Its Ministers have delivered bailouts to bankers and sided with the developers in the National Asset Management Agency.  The Labour Party in government has connived with employers to reduce the premium for Sunday working.  Given that the party has so resolutely delivered Frankfurt&rsquo;s way, it should be no surprise that it now proposes to deliver for moneylenders.</P>
        <P>As we approach the summer recess, Government Deputies, Ministers and advisers will be flying away to the sun.  When they walk past the airport porters, bar staff and waiters who are earning less on a Sunday because of the measures they introduced, let them reflect, as Labour Party Members, on what they have achieved.  Let them explain to the 200 people leaving Dublin Airport daily to find work abroad the role their party has played in government.  I am highlighting the role of the Labour Party in all of this because we expected better from it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>To put this debate in context, it is useful to consider some statistics.  We know, for example, that the income of the poorest households in the State fell by more than 18% in a single year, while that of the richest increased by 4%.  We also know that one quarter of credit card holders rely on those cards to make ends meet each month.  Some 40% of people have borrowed to pay for household bills in the past 12 months, with one in ten availing of the services of moneylenders.</P>
        <P>What strikes me in this debate is the number of Members who seek to justify the activities of moneylenders.  We have been told that introducing legislation to curtail their practices would force lenders into illegal activity.  Most of the legislation we discuss in this House is concerned in some way with preventing illegal activity.  The reality is that some of the charges demanded by these legal moneylenders are criminal.  No company can justify charging interest at 210%.  We are talking about people who are in desperate circumstances, with no alternative means of accessing money.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, pointed out last night that 17% of people in this country do not have access to a bank account.  How does the Government propose to address that scandalous situation?  Will it demand, for instance, that some of the State-owned banks make lending accessible to these people?  Unfortunately, I have not heard any solutions from the other side of the House.</P>
        <P>It was suggested last night that people who have information about illegal moneylenders should take it to the Garda so that a conviction can be pursued.  There was no mention that the last such case which went to court did not result in a conviction.  I do not know what happened in that particular instance, but I am well aware that some of the cases which failed in the past did so because of intimidation.  In one case, for example, the defendant had social welfare books belonging to different individuals.  When the matter went to court, however, none of those individuals was prepared to give evidence.  As I am speaking, there are people in my constituency being subjected to intimidation, some because of debts they owe and others because of drug-related matters.  I know of people who were stabbed or otherwise assaulted, people who had pipe bombs placed outside their homes and had their doors kicked in.  The Garda is aware of these incidents and we have discussed them at meetings of the local drugs task force.  This crisis is ongoing right across the city and more than likely in towns and villages throughout the State.</P>
        <P>It is easy for the Minister of State to say that people should come forward with information.  The reality, however, is that a person who owes a drugs debt, for instance, and is being intimidated is caught between a rock and a hard place.  Local garda&iacute; cannot protect such people because they do not have the resources to place a 24-hour guard outside their house.  Likewise, people continue to be exploited by moneylenders on the Government&rsquo;s watch.  My party has put forward a reasonable solution to the problem, only to be met with bizarre objections and attempts to justify the unjustifiable.</P>
        <P>What these people are doing is wrong and must be stopped.  Provident, one of the most successful moneylending companies in the country, charges a much lower interest rate of 20% to its customers in Poland.  Are we to believe that people in that country are so much more reliable than Irish people in repaying loans?  These companies are being allowed to exploit people&rsquo;s desperation.  People find themselves facing a situation, such as family illness or bereavement, a christening or communion, where they need to access money.  They are not borrowing huge amounts, but the interest charged means the debt grows very quickly.   They are then obliged to borrow from another source to repay the original debt and the situation quickly spirals out of control.  In response to the solution we have put forward, we are told that the banking system might investigate the issue.  Will the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, undertake instead to devise solutions that do not force people down this desperate path?  Nobody in this House should attempt to justify that which is unjustifiable.  The interest rates charged by these so-called legal moneylenders are a scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody in this House is aware that people throughout the country are struggling.  In many cases, it is measures introduced in this Chamber, by this Government and its predecessors, which have landed people in difficulties.  They are doing everything they can to keep their heads above water and make it to the next week with a little in their pockets and enough to pay the bills.  The problem is that not every expense can be foreseen and even those who are not too badly off and have managed to budget will be hit.  It might be a family illness or bereavement, the breakdown of the family car, or even a debt to a drug dealer.  It is not possible to plan for such eventualities when one is barely making ends meet.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>This is the point at which the moneylender comes in.  Those lucky enough to have some convincing way to prove they can pay can go to a licensed moneylender and get the few hundred or few thousand euro they need to tide the family over and allow them to bob back up above the crisis that is unfolding and carry on the ordinary struggle.</P>
        <P>The problem is not that the interest rate charged by the moneylenders is high but that it is extortionate and is not subject to a cap.  In some cases, the annual percentage rate, APR, has been found to be 200%.  It is argued that such high rates are required for the loan to be profitable given that they are made on a short-term basis and APR is an annual rate.  This argument has some validity because short-term loans necessitate charging higher interest rates if they are to be financially viable for the lending company.  However, elsewhere in Europe moneylending businesses get by just fine charging rates which are subject to a more strict cap than that proposed in the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes to limit to 40% the APR which can be charged by licensed moneylenders.  Of 27 European Union member states, 13 have imposed legal caps on the interest that can be charged by licensed lenders.  Spain, for example, applies a cap of 10% APR, while the upper limits imposed on APR in Belgium and France stand at 19.5% and 21.6%, respectively.</P>
        <P>Like many other Deputies, I have dealt with people in my office who are unable to sleep at night because they worry about their inability to repay a loan they may have secured to pay the costs of a hospital stay or essential dental work.  People are being taken advantage of and are having the incredibly difficult circumstances they face exploited by moneylenders who operate without restriction.  If people are desperate, they will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to any interest rate.  The Government has a duty to stop some of the current practices, not least because of the highly damaging effect its policies and those of the previous Government had on the livelihoods of ordinary working class people, the very people who are the customers of moneylenders.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s argument that the proposed limits would put moneylenders out of business is not good enough.  To argue that businesses cannot operate unless they are able to charge exorbitant rates of interest is not acceptable.  Having pursued all manner of policies which have taken money out of the local economy, it is shameful that the Government now rises to the defence of the moneylending industry.  I am not sure whether its approach to the Bill reflects a simple refusal to support any measure proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in or the Opposition or if it is based on genuine concern for those who would charge 60% interest on a loan to pay for a medical procedure.  Either way, it is extremely disappointing.</P>
        <P>The policies of the Government will not do anything to help those who are already deep in debt to moneylenders.  It is now refusing to prevent more people getting into similar circumstances.   Some 300,000 people have loans from moneylenders and the 1.8 million people who have less than &euro;100 at the end of the month are ripe for their picking.  The Government stands not in the defence of such people but in defence of the industry that will exploit them in their time of need, simply because the concerns of those who elected it are not its priority.</P>

	<P>Molaim an Teachta D&aacute;la, Pearse Doherty, as ucht an Bille seo a chur &oacute;s comhair na D&aacute;la.  Is ceist f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach agus is cinnte go bhfuil g&aacute; le h-athr&uacute; sa reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; daoine faoi bhr&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach, go h-&aacute;irithe daoine bochta, iad si&uacute;d is m&oacute; at&aacute; th&iacute;os leis an ngearch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;ochta.</P>
        <P>This is a progressive Bill designed to provide relief to the growing numbers of citizens who are becoming dependent on moneylenders.  Why is such dependence increasing?  The reason is that as a result of the policies of this Government and its predecessor, levels of poverty and inequality have increased and we have mass unemployment and social and economic exclusion of whole communities.  The testimony of those working in the community shows that people are being increasingly denied access to credit in banks, if they ever had any credit in the first instance, and are exhausting their credit with credit unions.  As a last resort, many more people are turning to moneylenders, both licensed and unlicensed.  The State is failing in its duty to protect such people.  The licensed moneylending sector is poorly regulated, the regulatory regime, such as it is, is much too complex, the rates of interest charged are exorbitant and the profit-making is excessive to the point of gross exploitation.</P>
        <P>In a briefing on the Bill in this House yesterday, a representative of FLAC, the Free Legal Aid Centres, pointed out that when the organisation highlighted regulatory deficiencies in the moneylending sector to the Department of Finance, it was told the market will look after consumers.  This is the type of thinking that led to the banking collapse.  The Central Bank has admitted to FLAC that the regulatory regime for moneylending needs reform, but such reform is not its priority.  Once again, it is the most marginalised who lose out as a result of this type of neglect.  It is the woman who takes out a loan on the doorstep to make a Christmas for her children, the single mother who borrows to fund a first communion or the struggling parents who succumb to the moneylender to ensure their children can attend school with some dignity and have some chance of receiving a basic education.</P>
        <P>There is a myth that licensed moneylending in this country is mostly carried out by small local operators.  The reality is that the market is dominated by one highly profitable, British-based corporation, Provident, which is quoted on the London Stock Exchange.  Provident is largely owned by financial services companies because its activities complement the policy pursued by the banks of seeking to exclude, in as far as possible, small and perhaps relatively unprofitable customers.  It is estimated that the company has 100,000 debtors in this State but we do not know the size of its loan book, the full extent of its activities or the profits it sources here because European Union regulations treat Britain and Ireland as one region.  As a result, figures for this State can be buried in the overall so-called regional account.</P>
        <P>It is long past time for stricter regulation of the moneylending sector, greater transparency and some measure of relief for borrowers.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls for a cap to be imposed on the interest rates applied to loans from licensed moneylenders.  This measure is essential, especially as no cap is in place, presumably on the basis of the Department&rsquo;s spurious view that the market will look after consumers.  The Minister may as well say the wolves will look after the sheep.  As legislators, we must step in to protect members of the public.  If it is the case that the Government will decline to support the Bill, I appeal to the Minister to indicate the steps he proposes to take to address this pressing issue and the timeframe within which he intends to do so.</P>
        <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions estimates that 10% of people are turning to moneylenders to pay household bills.  This is a significant proportion of the population and there is more than ample evidence in all our constituencies to indicate the numbers are growing.  The Government must not sit on its hands any longer.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is conscious of the need to avoid setting the APR rate too low as this could result in circumstances where licensed moneylenders leave the market to illegal operators which are worse again.  Citizens need protection from illegal moneylenders.  It beggars belief that there has not been a single prosecution for illegal moneylending in the past seven years, despite ample evidence of this activity taking place.  I urge the Minister to recognise the seriousness of the position for many of our citizens by allowing the Bill to pass Second Stage.  The Minister may then deal with it to his satisfaction on subsequent Stages.</P>

	<P>Seo Bille ar ba mhaith liom a chur chun cinn nuair a thoghadh m&eacute; don D&aacute;il don ch&eacute;ad uair i 2002.  Ag an am, bh&iacute; me an-buartha, mar at&aacute;im &oacute; shin, faoin mbealach ina bhfuil cead tugtha do reachmas&oacute;ir&iacute; &mdash; mar sin at&aacute; i gceist &mdash; r&aacute;ta&iacute; &uacute;is de bhreis is 200% a ghearradh ar dhaoine.  Ag an am, i 2002, an ceann is airde a bh&iacute; ann n&aacute; 195%, agus feictear dom go bhfuil s&eacute; imithe in olcas &oacute; shin.</P>
        <P>Research carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions shows that 40% of people have borrowed to pay household bills in the past 12 months and 10% are likely to use moneylenders.  In November 2010, Sinn F&eacute;in carried out research in my area on the impact of social welfare cuts.  We surveyed more than 270 social welfare recipients in dole queues and post offices in Ballyfermot and the south inner city.  Our survey found that at the time more than half of respondents confirmed they were likely to borrow money to see them through Christmas.  Since the survey, two further rounds of social welfare cuts were imposed by the previous and current Governments.  The numbers borrowing to cover current spending are likely to be much greater by now.</P>
        <P>Since then the Minister for Social Protection has driven more people into the hands of moneylending vultures.  The underemployed who currently receive a partial jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are about to get a letter giving one week&rsquo;s notice that their benefit is to be cut.  The income of a couple with two children will be down from &euro;186 to &euro;149 per week, a cut of &euro;37 per week or almost &euro;150 per month.  A cut of this size represents the difference between having the money to pay the gas or electricity bill and having to borrow the money to pay those bills.</P>
        <P>Likewise, many workers approaching retirement will receive a much smaller pension than expected due to under-the-radar cuts being introduced in September through secondary legislation.  Without notice, many pensioners will receive a pension far smaller than what they legitimately expected.  A worker retiring from September onwards who expected a State pension of &euro;225 will now get &euro;30 less per week, an annual loss of &euro;1,500, with even more lost in the case of a couple.  These people are another category the Labour Party, in particular, is pushing into the claws of unscrupulous moneylenders, be they legal or illegal.</P>
        <P>Tonight we are dealing with those moneylenders that are legalised by the State.  These companies know exactly who they are targeting &mdash; financially struggling unemployed people.  Anyone watching daytime television will see the sort of advertisement that is swamping television in Britain, which promises a quick fix.  It is the same quick fix that is being suggested by companies located in Ireland to those who are unemployed and are being screwed by the Government &mdash; people whose incomes have been cut to the extent that they cannot put bread on the table or pay the gas and electricity bills that are arriving.  They are seeking a way out and see these companies offering a quick fix, but the quick fix does not exist.  The problem is that this Government and those before it have legalised the charging of exorbitant rates by legal moneylenders.  That practice must end and this Bill is a mechanism for achieving that.  If the Government has minor problems with it, it should at the very least allow it to proceed on Second Stage and deal with those problems on Committee Stage, as is often done with Bills that have minor problems.  I urge the Government to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JonathanOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last 17 months I have heard many speeches delivered with a brass neck by Ministers.  Last night, however, I heard one of the most delusional speeches I have heard in all that time.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, argued that a consequence of capping the APR rate at 40% would be that &ldquo;moneylending would no longer be viable, licence renewals would not be sought and it would effectively close down the industry.&rdquo;  The only evidence the Minister of State put forward in his speech was research carried out in England that stated that for legal moneylending to be a break-even industry, an APR of 123% would be needed.  That simply does not stack up.  We heard last night from Deputy Doherty that at least 13 other EU member states have APR caps of between 15% and 25% and the companies that are engaged in legal moneylending in those member states are turning a tidy profit.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State then went on to say that legal moneylenders service a gap in the market deemed to suit particular needs of customers &mdash; for example, convenience of payment or a long-standing relationship with a particular moneylender.  What does that even mean?  We are talking about the most vulnerable section of society.  That is what the Minister of State is talking about when he speaks of filling a gap in the market.  The reason is that the Government has abandoned that section of society.  The policies the Government is pursuing, like those of the previous Government, are pushing that section of society further and further into poverty, forcing them to engage with moneylenders.  The gap in the market exists because the political establishment does not have the moral or political will to stand up for the most vulnerable people in society.  It is too busy kowtowing to the troika, the IMF, the German Government and anyone else who will pat the Taoiseach on the head.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s comment about having a long-standing relationship with a particular moneylender shows how far disengaged from reality he is.  The reason individuals have long-standing relationships with moneylenders is that once they are sucked into that cycle, they cannot get out of it.  That is the only reason they have such relationships.  The most laughable suggestion I heard in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was his attempt to justify the charging of massive APRs by legal moneylenders.  He said that all moneylenders, when advertising their services, must ensure their advertisements contain the following, in large font: &ldquo;WARNING: This is a high cost loan&rdquo;.  It is a pity we could not put a similar warning on the programme for Government, reading &ldquo;WARNING: Contains false promises, lies and lots of bull&rdquo;.  That would be a lot more appropriate.</P>
        <P>I understand where Fine Gael is coming from in opposing this Bill but it beggars belief that there are Labour Party Deputies in this Chamber who will vote against this modest proposal &mdash; TDs from the so-called party of the working class.  I have no doubt there are genuine Labour Party Deputies in this Chamber who are sick to their stomachs at the carry-on of the leadership of their party and how its members have conducted themselves as Ministers.  This is a party that likes to portray itself as the guard dog of the Government, when in reality it has become no more than the lapdog of Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I have misjudged some of those backbench Labour Party Deputies.  Perhaps I was naive to think that at least some of them have principles and morals.  Maybe those backbench Deputies are just blind to what Deputy Gilmore and the other Ministers are doing in Government around the Cabinet table.  Perhaps they do not have the backbone to stand up to them and do what the Labour Party claims to do &mdash; protect the most vulnerable.  Maybe they have just become too comfortable, keeping their heads down while the T&aacute;naiste, a man with experience of wrecking more than one political movement in his lifetime, continues to wreck the Labour Party and everything it claims to stand for.  It makes me sick to listen to some of the comments from the Labour Party backbenchers tonight.  Not only does it make me sick, however; it pushes tens of thousands more people in our society &mdash; the most vulnerable citizens &mdash; further into poverty, causing them greater distress and difficulty.  It does not have to be like that.  Those Labour Party backbenchers can stand up and do what they were elected to do: protect the most vulnerable in society.  They can do that at 9 p.m. by supporting this Bill and not acting as a mudguard for Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to thank all Deputies from all sides of the House for their useful contributions to this worthwhile debate.  The Government is well aware of the financial difficulties facing persons who have to resort to moneylenders for loans to meet everyday bills.  This point was highlighted in the debate.  It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the legislation underpinning the moneylending service is robust and rigorously enforced.  The interest rate charged by licensed moneylenders, which on the face of it seems particularly high, is one aspect that must be kept under review so as not to further affect vulnerable persons who, for whatever reason, have no other source of credit.  I now turn to several issues raised by Deputies during the debate.  As mentioned last night by the Minister of State, the Central Bank is the regulator for moneylenders and under section 93(10)(<i>g</i>) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender a licence if in the bank&rsquo;s opinion the cost of the credit to be charged is excessive or if any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  Deputies raised the issue of the lower of interest rate charged in other member states.  I am advised that it is misleading to attempt to make simple comparisons purely on the basis of money lending rates since the financial markets and the regulatory regimes for moneylenders that pertain in euro member states vary considerably.  We will continue to monitor developments in the European Union.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank has experience in licensing moneylenders and in examining what may be termed excessive or unfair lending as set out in section 93 of the Act.  The Central Bank is best placed to develop guidelines which will provide greater transparency with regard to the rates charged.  This a complex issue and it is vital when considering the need for further legislation to have the full facts in order not to exacerbate the current situation, to which Deputies alluded to during the debate.  It may take time and effort but it is important that the appropriate policy is implemented.</P>
        <P>Where a moneylender engages the services of a third party to collect debts on his or her behalf, he or she must have in place a written contractual arrangement that seeks to ensure that customers are treated in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection code for licensed moneylenders.  The moneylender must also inform the affected customer that the money lending arrangement has been assigned to a third party as soon as practicable following the assignment of the money lending agreement.</P>
        <P>Deputies also referred to the work of the credit union movement to provide an alternative to those whose only recourse to credit is the moneylender.  In the programme for Government the Government has recognised the importance of the credit union movement as a volunteer movement and distinguishes between credit unions and other financial institutions.  Credit unions, operating close to the population they serve, remain a central part of the Irish financial landscape.  There are in excess of 400 credit unions in the State and all communities should have ready access to a branch for savings and, in turn, for loans.  The Government recently published the general scheme of the credit union Bill which makes provision for the future development of the credit union sector with a view to ensuring the continued access to reasonably prices lending by local communities.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the delay in dealing with an appeal by a constituent to the Department of Social Protection.  The person was then forced to resort to a moneylender for day-to-day expenses.  I am advised by the social welfare appeals office that the number of appeals to that office has increased dramatically since early 2009.  For the first half of this year alone, approximately 19,000 appeals have been received.  In an effort to reduce the processing time for all appeals the Department has appointed 13 additional appeals officers since 2010, bringing to 40 the total number of appeals officers now serving.  In addition the office has improved its business processes and its information technology support.  I hope these actions will alleviate the problems drawn to the attention of the House by Deputy Ferris.</P>
        <P>Reference was made in the debate to financial education.  The National Consumer Agency has a statutory remit to promote the interests of financial services by providing information on financial services, including information on the cost to consumers and the risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services, and by promoting the development of financial education and capability.  The agency consistently points out that consumers should consider the interest rate charged for credit arrangements and the overall rate of credit rather than simply focusing on the weekly or monthly payments.  The agency also highlights the importance of checking that a moneylender is licensed and the dangers of dealing with illegal moneylenders.  The agency has several financial education programmes targeted at various sectors of society.  These include workplace financial programmes designed to provide employees with access to free personal finance education in their workplace.  This information is impartial and is offered free of charge.  It covers topics such as money planning, savings, insurance and pensions.  The agency has also developed a scheme aimed at senior secondary school students and one for new parents, circulated though maternity hospitals to approximately 60,000 parents each year.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Doherty for proposing the Private Members&rsquo; Bill and all Deputies for the constructive debate on this important issue.  This is a worthwhile debate and we must ensure that the implications of any amendment to the existing arrangements are fully considered.  Deputies can rest assured that the Government remains fully committed to financial inclusion and to access to credit for all at a fair cost.  The are 46 licensed moneylenders in the country.  The debate was interesting and I will draw the debate to the attention of the Central Bank Governor so that he can reflect on how he moves it forward.</P>

	<P>On the rare occasions when we hear the term &ldquo;moneylender&rdquo; we automatically conjure up an image of a shady character, usually a man exploiting the poor and vulnerable.  Only the latter part of this statement is accurate.  The poor, vulnerable and, above all, desperate are the main users of this service.  Although it may offend our middle-class sensibilities moneylenders are, given the current environment, offering a service and I will return to this point later.</P>
        <P>There is a perception in the public imagination of the moneylender as a shady male character.  While it would be naive to suggest that such people did not exist, it is wide of the mark.  The greater share of licensed non-banking money lending in Ireland is controlled by Provident Financial plc, a global company operating in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Poland, Romania and other jurisdictions.  Provident is quoted on the London stock exchange and describes itself as a non-standard provider of home-delivered credit for unsecured consumers.  In other words, it lends door to-door to people with no assets.</P>
        <P>This is a lucrative business.  According to Bloomberg, Provident will have revenues of $1.1 billion in 2013.  In the long term Provident aims to be the main provider of credit to 10 million people in the UK and Ireland who collectively borrow &euro;65 billion each year.  In Ireland the interest rate charged is 187%.  I took a cursory look at Provident&rsquo;s website.  Upon first viewing one might think one had mistakenly entered a children&rsquo;s play site.  The childlike nature of the site, with its bright colours and cartoonish characters, can seduce those in search of easy cash while concealing the dark underbelly that is money lending in Ireland.  Various boxes on the webpage offer cash loans from &euro;100 to &euro;500 with low, manageable weekly repayments and no late fee.  If these do not succeed in enticing the desperate then a subsequent box with the bold heading, &ldquo;Can I get a Cash Loan?&rdquo; might do so.  This is aimed at people who may be unemployed, who have a poor credit history or who have been turned down before.  The website answers in the affirmative suggesting that all circumstances will be considered and, using bold red lettering, invites the prospective applicant to &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo;.  Thus people begin their journey into a vicious cycle of debt from which few escape.</P>
        <P>In this harsh, often hidden world the working poor, the under-employed, people with disabilities, members of the Travelling community, single mothers and other vulnerable people are consciously exploited through no fault of their own.  These people are overwhelmingly concentrated in working class communities throughout urban Ireland.  They live in neighbourhoods that have experienced virtually nothing of the Celtic tiger but everything that is bad and negative about the ongoing recession.  In social, political and economic terms these people occupy the urban wastelands of contemporary Ireland.  Thus far the political elite have continued to turn a blind eye to their plight.  In many respects this in the most benign aspect of this tale.</P>
        <P>More alarming and more politically relevant is the fact that the Government, through its austerity policies and the harsh budget, has essentially consigned these people to a life of poverty, uncertainty and to a future of endless scraping to just eke out some form of existence.  The State&rsquo;s deliberate reproduction of a class of permanently poor people and its callous disregard of its responsibility to provide an adequate safety net for those experiencing economic hardship and living in poverty is nothing short of scandalous.  Despite this, the State has no problem bailing out zombie banks and unknown bondholders.  It can afford to pay thousands of euro in salaries to bankrupt developers, the very same people who bankrupted the State.</P>
        <P>Provident&rsquo;s poor and vulnerable customers have no place in this discourse on banking, economics and the state of the nation.  They are in every respect surplus to requirements &mdash; a lumpen population left to the mercy of money-lending vultures.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>A recent policy briefing by Social Justice Ireland shows that the income of Ireland&rsquo;s poorest households fell by over 18% in a single year, while the income of the richest rose by 4%.  The report suggests that the top 10% of the population receives almost 14 times more disposable income.  In comparison, the poor are experiencing the worst income distribution over the past 30 years.  This is clear evidence, as if any were needed, that current Government policy is class based in that it consciously and deliberately favours the rich over the poor and vulnerable.  Put another way, there is something profoundly wrong with Government decisions that produce a lopsided distribution of income favouring the richest when Ireland&rsquo;s poor and those on middle incomes struggle to make ends meet.  If anyone is in doubt about the negative impact of current Government policy on those struggling to get by, or of the impact of economic policy on class composition, then the stark reality is that as a result of a succession of austerity measures the disposable income of the poorest households fell by 18.6% in a single year, while the incomes of the richest rose by 4.1%.</P>
        <P>Overwhelmingly, this has had a disproportionate impact on women and children.  For example, over 200,000 children in Ireland are now believed to be living in poverty.  Another 700,000 persons are at risk of poverty, and all the while unemployment is rising.  Such figures are by any measure disgraceful and they reveal the profound disconnect of those in power from the reality of life for the low paid and the poor.  This indifference and basic lack of empathy and humanity with their fellow Irish men and women is only superseded by an arrogance that emanates from the male-dominated middle-class elites who govern the country in their own interests.</P>
        <P>Most of those who borrow from moneylenders in Ireland are women.  There are cultural reasons for this but, more importantly, there are structural ones.  For example, international research has repeatedly shown that poor households, whether in Ireland or in the developing world, are almost always headed by women.  This explains why almost 80% of moneylenders who Provident employs are also women.  These workers receive no wage &mdash; rather they work on commission.</P>
        <P>There are a number of actions the Government could take immediately to loosen the grip of moneylenders in poor communities.  It could compel the banks, almost all of which are now State-owned, to offer basic bank accounts to those with limited means.  It could support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill and place a cap of 40% APR on licensed moneylenders.  However, the most important requirement in tackling poverty and exclusion is the provision of sufficient income to enable people to live with dignity and in the final analysis, such a measure would also allow those who currently occupy positions of power in this country also to have some dignity.  I urge all Members to support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>

    <Title>Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill and I thank the Technical Group for allowing me some of their speaking time to talk on the matter.</P>
        <P>The reform of our insolvency laws is long overdue.  When we look back on the way we have dealt with debt and people who are in a state of crisis we can see that it was very much a requirement for new legislation to be brought before the House.</P>
        <P>Broadly speaking, I welcome the efforts of the Government, and I thank and compliment the Minister and the people working in the Department for the work they have done.  I would not say that the Bill goes far enough.  I can see inadequacies in the Bill and problems that may arise with it but at least a serious effort is being made at reform and change.  This legislation should have been brought before the House by the previous Government and it should have been brought here earlier in the term of this Government but I welcome it.</P>
        <P>The change in the bankruptcy period from 12 years to three years is most welcome.  Unfortunately, many good business people run into financial difficulties and must declare bankruptcy.  They always say it is a very good man or woman who goes down and comes back up again, and everybody in business realises only too well, especially those with a small business or those struggling to keep people in employment, that they can run into difficulties.  It is welcome that such people will be given a second chance but we must ensure that the people who are owed money are offered every protection possible as many small businesses are going under because they are unable to collect money that is properly owed to them.</P>
        <P>The extent of the crisis in Ireland is frightening.  In terms of people&rsquo;s personal finances, I have always stated that the most important financial institution in Ireland is Mom&rsquo;s purse because everything depends on what is in Mom&rsquo;s purse on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Sunday.  If Mom&rsquo;s purse was okay, everything in Ireland was okay but, unfortunately, in recent years the amount of money going into Mom&rsquo;s purse every week has been growing smaller and smaller, and that is the most important financial institution in the country.</P>
        <P>What young people are going through at present is frightening and it is affecting their physical and mental health.  In that regard I want to thank and compliment the different agencies, including MABS and the Citizens&rsquo; Information offices, which do untold good work in helping people with their finances.  There are MABS offices throughout the country.  In my role as a member of the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board I was glad to be one of the first people to suggest that we should have a new MABS office in the town of Killarney because its growing population and those of the surrounding villages and parishes more than entitled it to have an office of its own.  I welcome the work that has been done to bring that to reality.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to compliment charitable associations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is doing untold work in the background in providing vital assistance.  When families are in debt and have difficulty getting social welfare there is an interim period in which they do not have money to put food on the kitchen table.  Those are the cases that I see first-hand.  I do not want to mention the different towns but I compliment the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other such organisations for the excellent work they do every day in the towns in my constituency in both south Kerry and north Kerry.  Their volunteers give freely of their time either by fund-raising or by distributing fuel, helping people with groceries or helping them to pay for ESB bills on which they have fallen behind.  Their work is to be appreciated by every one of us.</P>
        <P>I said at the outset that I have problems with the Bill.  I am worried that some people may be left behind.  Will our banking and other financial institutions deal fairly with the people who, to be honest, in many cases they led up the garden path, so to speak?  We must be clear about that.  Young people went into their banks looking for, say, &euro;150,000 and were persuaded to leave with &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000.  They were told it was okay to bundle other loans, be they car loans, loans to carry out renovation works or anything else.  They were even told they could include money to be used to go on holiday in their bundled loan.  That was ridiculous, irresponsible and out-of-control banking, yet these are the people dealing with the customers who are put to the pin of their collar and facing desperate circumstances every day of the week in trying to repay these massive debts.  That is the reason I am fearful that the banking institutions will have a veto when dealing with people.  Will they be as fair and lenient in dealing with their customers now as they were when they were over-generous in giving out the money in the first instance?</P>
        <P>We all have our own horror stories of individual cases of people being led up a merry path by those working in the banking institutions.  I do not want to tar everybody with the same brush because very fine people work behind the counters of banks every day but, unfortunately, they are facing the brunt of it in terms of actions taken not by them but by their bosses and people higher up along the chain.  In some cases the clerks and other people dealing with the customers on a daily basis are being wrongly blamed for the reckless banking by some of our banks and some of the people working in them.</P>
        <P>I was not happy with comments made last week by the Minister, who told people they would have to sell their bits and pieces of jewellery and so on.  It was not helpful to tell people that they should sell off items such as their wedding rings.  That was not a sensible or prudent thing for a Minister to state.  I say that having already complimented him on the work involved in preparing the Bill and going as far as he has.  However, that was not a prudent thing for a Minister to say.  People are in such dire straits that they want sensible talk from Government and helpful suggestions, not to hear such nonsense.</P>
        <P>To return to the bones of the Bill, I again compliment those who ensured the D&aacute;il would sit later than usual to process the Bill before the recess.  If the Bill is to be helpful there must not be undue delay with it.  I thank and compliment FLAC, the free legal advice centres, and Chartered Accountants Ireland who have raised concerns about the fact that there is no outline of a code of conduct audit or disciplinary processes.  They have stated that the Oireachtas must address each of those concerns during the legislative process with the Select Committee on Justice and Equality in the vanguard.</P>
        <P>I compliment FLAC on its helpful comments and on the initial submission it made that was very well put together and most helpful and informative.  I wish to pay particular attention to one aspect of its submission, namely, that it expects MABS to continue to be very busy in terms of the core work it carries out, being the first point of repair for indebted people.  It stated that MABS must be properly resourced to carry out the vitally important work of income maximisation and negotiation of affordable repayment of creditors.  I welcome the fact that it made this important point.  FLAC also went on to say that the extent to which MABS will be involved in proposing plans under the legislation remains to be seen but, regardless, MABS and other groups working for and on behalf of indebted people will play a critical role in helping people to understand and evaluate their options.  In the context of the latter point I am concerned at how the banks and other lending institutions will deal with the cases of individual customers and will direct them to the appropriate services.  Given the complexity of the legislation, FLAC states that it is also evident that comprehensive legal advice will be necessary before debtors commit themselves to availing of their potential options.</P>
        <P>The Bill states that a period of three years will be required before a person can be released from a state of bankruptcy rather than the previous 12 years.  Since the downturn in the economy we saw the ridiculous situation where we exported the problem in that some of the big players in terms of financial indebtedness who went to England were able to come back and operate again in a matter of 12 months.  Exporting such problems to England or Scotland is not the way to proceed.  Time will tell, but the Government did the correct thing in setting a duration of three years.  A year might have been too short and anything more than three years would have been too long because while those concerned had financial problems, if they are going back into business we want them to do their business in this country rather than setting up in England which would mean we would lose out on the jobs they might help to create.  Not everyone has the wherewithal to create jobs.  Such people are few and far between.  That is why we want to create a situation where those people can come back, start up their businesses again and begin to create sustainable jobs.  If they did it before, I hope they will be able to do it again.  We do not want to lose the work ethic of some of those people to other parts of the world.</P>
        <P>I have problems with the Bill and we will see which way the vote will go later tonight.  Overall, it would be helpful for the Bill to go through, which it will, but I will have problems voting for it because it does not go far enough.  I compliment those who work so hard every day on a voluntary basis to help people to try to overcome the difficulties in which they find themselves.  We must ensure that people&rsquo;s mental health is protected.  I am aware from my clinics of the pressure debt imposes on young families in particular.  They were never under such pressure.  Our forebears were reared with no money.  They had no money but at the same time they did not have the bills or the indebtedness.  That is the big difference between the past and the present.  In the 1950s we had mass emigration from this country.  The people who left did so because there was no work and no money but they were not up to their eyes in debt in the way people are today.  There is a mental pressure on people today that did not exist previously.  This is unprecedented.  We are in uncharted waters.  Young couples are starting out in life with young families that are literally buried underneath an avalanche of debt.  We must ensure that the State does everything to protect those people.</P>
        <P>I have always stated that just because people are heavily in debt does not mean they are lesser people.  It does not mean that they do not have to be treated with respect.  I am adamant that the banks and lending institutions must treat their customers properly.  Just because they are in debt does not mean they can treat them in a disrespectful way.  I have seen high-handed actions by repossession companies.  Famous cases were highlighted in the Chamber by Deputy Mattie McGrath of people going out in the dark of night repossessing machinery at the orders of banking institutions.  In some instances they even got so carried away they repossessed and took machinery on which not a penny was owed; they took the wrong machines.  That is what happens when ones goes out in the middle of the night.  Such behaviour must not be allowed.  If people are in trouble with debt, it must be dealt with in a proper, respectful fashion.  The people who incurred those debts were enticed to do so.  In many cases they were only trying to better themselves, create employment, improve family farms or in the case of contractors they were trying to buy machinery to get more work.  If things went wrong it does not give people the right to go out in the middle of the night under the cover of darkness to act in a totally improper manner.  I hope, particularly because of the cases highlighted in this Chamber, that such a scenario will not happen again.  It should not be allowed to recur because were such carry-on to be condoned or allowed, it would give rise to a bad situation.  Moreover, horrible things could happen because of it, as tempers would be high and one would not know what might happen.  As no one wishes to see such situations develop, it is better for the banks, the lending institutions and so on to be calm and thoughtful when dealing with their customers, that is, the people who they enticed in the first instance to bury themselves in this sea of debt.  It is to be hoped such occurrences will never happen again.</P>
        <P>I spoke about what I called the biggest and most important financial institution in the country, namely, Mom&rsquo;s purse.  Over time, it is to be hoped these young struggling families will find themselves in a position in which the weight and worry bearing down on them at present will be lifted and the level of indebtedness in which they find themselves will be reduced.  Members have seen the bailouts for the banks and all the big people.  Where is the bailout for the young couples who are buried in debt?  Where is the assistance for them?  Hopefully, such assistance will start in this Bill but it must go further.  In addition, the Government must go further to ensure that all possible assistance will be made available to the people concerned.</P>

	<P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share my time with Deputy Alex White.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this long-awaited legislation.  While the Bill is a complex item of law, it has the ability to change the lives of many citizens for the better in a way other Bills cannot.  If Members make this Bill as good as it can be, it has the potential to help families sleep at night.  This is one of the recurring themes to come up each time I canvass or speak to people in my constituency of Meath East.  Many people are afraid they will lose their homes or personal property because of debt and this is a huge concern nationwide.  Such debt can range from a credit union loan to credit card debt to large negative equity mortgages.  People ask me what the Government will do about it and when will the Government do something to help them out.  I believe this Bill will help to do something positive for them.  It will give people a way of dealing with their debt, which they have not had the opportunity to do heretofore.  Each settlement arrangement enables the debtor to go through a step-by-step process that can result in him or her coming to an agreement with his or her creditors to pay off the outstanding debts over a longer period and this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>However, I have some concerns in that some steps that must be taken will be extremely complicated, which is regrettable because it is essential to make this process as easy as possible for everyone to use and understand.  People who are already facing serious levels of debt have enough to be getting on with without additional stress and pressure from trying to work out precisely how they should work their way through this system.  As all Members are aware from their experience of helping people through the difficult, archaic social welfare system, complicated systems only add to people&rsquo;s frustration and sense of despair.  This new legislation provides the opportunity to develop a system that will not do this but will help people in a sensible, coherent and easily understandable way.  Let a system be created that is easy to use, fair and transparent for all to see and the mistakes that have been made in the administration of some social welfare schemes should not be recreated.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has been raised with me is the possibility of people who acted as mortgages brokers during the boom times now being hired to act as the intermediaries between the insolvency service and debtors.  This possibility was first reported in a Sunday newspaper many months ago and from speaking to people afterwards, I am aware it was greeted with mixed feelings.  I remember one of the first cases I dealt with after being elected was for constituents who approached me about their mortgage debt problem.  They were given a mortgage ten times their salary to buy a house in Ashbourne and are now in serious trouble trying to make ends meet and trying to keep up with their repayments, while at the same time trying to maintain a decent standard of living.  While this Bill hopefully will help them, the situation is an example of the reckless lending that has led to the urgent need for this legislation in the first place.</P>
        <P>People must trust this new service and if they think the people running it are the same individuals who recklessly lent them money five years ago, the Government might have a problem in gaining the public&rsquo;s trust on this issue.  This is a point on which I wish to expand on further.  The public must have faith and trust in this measure.  They must trust that it will help them in a fair and equitable manner.  While a new service can be created, were the first few cases to go through it not to be dealt with appropriately and fairly, the danger would be the people&rsquo;s trust would not be gained in the first instance.  As Members do not wish to create a folly, it is incredibly important to listen to the concerns of groups and individuals who are making comments on the settlement process at present in respect of what are the potential problems and how it could be made better.  They must be listened to and their concerns must be taken into account and responded to through the Committee State debate.  Moreover, Member should make changes to the legislation when so doing would make it better.  It has been stated by many that this Bill is the most radical solution to personal debt that has been tried by a country.  If this is the case, Members must make sure it is easy to access for those who need it.  If they can manage that, they can give people the opportunity to get back on their feet in order to move forward with their lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  As Deputy Hannigan noted, it is complex legislation and is a vital element of the response of the Government and the Oireachtas to the broader issue of debt and debt resolution faced by so many people and which is faced at a macro level by the economy.  As Deputy Hannigan suggested, it deserves close scrutiny.  However, I wish to begin by reflecting on the process associated with this legislation.  As I stated, it is a highly complex Bill that is a response to a real need.  In addition, part of the context of the Bill is that historically, Ireland&rsquo;s bankruptcy laws have required reform for many years or decades.  It was only when we entered into the crisis that in many ways we had no choice but to address the shortcomings and flaws in our insolvency regime.</P>
        <P>It is important to reflect on the point that this legislation has had the benefit of a considerable amount of debate and discussion, which is only right and absolutely proper.  However, one often hears about the process in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the D&aacute;il and the relationship between the Government and the Parliament.  The point is made, albeit perhaps more often in television and radio studios than anywhere else, that the Government determines what is the legislation and what is the law and there is little or no participation by Parliament or anyone else.  Whereas that criticism sometimes is well made and well taken, this Bill constitutes an example in which there has been genuine participation and input by Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Moreover, there has been an increasing number of such examples over the short lifetime of the present Administration thus far.  Members should not forget the heads of the scheme of this Bill were published in January 2012 and the Bill has had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  This is an initiative I am happy to state the Government has been developing in respect of legislation across the board.  As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I am pleased to have been involved in a similar type of process in respect of the protected disclosures legislation, which is another element of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme.  It allowed for that kind of input; not just of committee members, but also of the various stakeholders, NGOs and interested persons who had an interest in how the legislation should look.  This delivered on an undertaking by the new Government to ensure that there was scrutiny prior to the publication of legislation.   That is one of the shortcomings that we have had in the past as parliamentarians.  Legislation is published and to a great extent, much of the work has been completed at that stage and it has been relatively difficult in the past to persuade the Minister to persuade the Government to look at possible changes.  However, I commend the Minister for allowing this Bill to breathe in the committee.  The Minister has had the benefit of the responses of the various members of that committee and the representatives of the bodies invited in during the course of that hearing.  It is especially important for a Bill such as this.</P>
        <P>There are many citizens who are interested in this Bill and who are affected by our current insolvency regime.  There are also non-governmental organisations that have had a very useful input into the Bill already.  They may not have been entirely <i>ad idem</i> with the Minister on all aspects of what is proposed, but at least they had an opportunity to have an input prior to the publication of the Bill.  I know that their voices will be listened to in the next few months when the Bill is on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The banks and the credit institutions have also been consulted.  When people reflect on that fact, they are critical of the idea that the banks would have an input into this Bill.  There is no point in believing that we can exclude the banks and the lending institutions from an assessment of the proper balance between the needs of debtors and the position of the creditors and the lending institutions.  We in the Parliament and the Government in particular have to establish what that correct balance should be.  I notice that in the Bills digest prepared by the very helpful Library and Research Service, the objectives of the Bill from an economic viewpoint are set out.  There are four such objectives and it is written in very helpful but perhaps rather stark, cold economic language, although it makes sense.  The first objective is to allow sufficient repayment to creditors that lenders are willing to lend, if not to the insolvent debtor, at least to others in the economy.  The second objective is to reduce the disincentive to work for insolvent debtors.  The third objective is to prevent creditors from harming debtors by racing to be the first to collect.  The final objective is to provide debtors with partial consumption insurance, which means if a person reduces outstanding debt, it frees up cash to be spent on consumption in the economy.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage we often talk about the philosophy of legislation, rather than its detail.  Part of what we need to do is to have regard to the viability of the lending institutions.  We should say that clearly.  We are parliamentarians and representatives and we have seen in the community many pressurised situations faced by citizens.  Our principal focus is on the citizen, the debtor and the person who is in financial difficulty.  Nobody should apologise for that being our principal focus, but we must answer other questions.  What do we say about the lending institutions?  What do we say about the viability of the lending institutions?  There is always the temptation to say that we use every opportunity to punish the lending institutions and God knows they deserve punishment for many reasons outlined in the House.  However, do we want to continue to have viable lending institutions?  That is to say nothing of the fact that the particular institutions we are talking about are owned by the taxpayer; therefore, there is an additional reason to ensure they are viable.  I do not make that point to take away from the necessary focus on the dilemma and the situation faced by debtors.  We should be looking to ensure we have the best possible protection for them.  The three stage process outlined in the Bill seems appropriate to me, but there is no point ignoring what we think the banks should be able to do in the future.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about the veto and there is some disagreement as to whether the voting powers, percentages and so on outlined in the Bill can be described as a veto.  There is the possibility for lending institutions to block agreements in certain circumstances.  For that reason, the attitude taken by the banks in the future will be absolutely crucial to the success of this legislation.  It is very clear that the banks will be required to take the most flexible and sensitive approach to these debtors and the agreements and settlements proposed.</P>
        <P>The chief executive of Permanent TSB was before the finance committee this afternoon.  We look to what people do with greater interest than listen to what they say, but if he is to be believed on what he said, I thought there was quite a flexible, sensitive attitude being displayed by PTSB on this Bill.  However, it will be actions that will speak rather than words.  All eyes will be on the banks and the lending institutions.  There will be a very high expectation that they will come across for the working out of this legislation for individual debtors and proposals.  I know that all Members will want to see that addressed properly.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  Although we have had this pre-legislative scrutiny, much work has been done.  Considerably more work needs to be done to go through the Bill line by line.  It is enormously complex.  It is a very important reforming Bill introduced by this Government, and is one of a raft of laws brought forward to address the crisis and the impact of the crisis on ordinary citizens.  I congratulate the Minister once again and wish the legislation well in the course of its passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I cautiously welcome this Bill, which is long overdue.  The basis for the Bill is the recommendation from the Law Reform Commission, published in December 2010, which outlined the reform of the legal system on how our society manages and deals with problems of indebtedness.  The recommendation of the LRC makes sense and represents a breath of fresh air in an area of law that has long been forgotten.</P>
        <P>The main thrust of the recommendations are contained in the insolvency Bill, but there is a need to tease out many issues in it to figure out the best options available to citizens when the Bill finally becomes law.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will permit those who no longer service the debt to seek a remedy outside of the courts through the non-judicial route.  These trustees will play a crucial role as a go-between for the mortgage holder who applies for one of the non-judicial options and the various creditors.  There should be penalties and sanctions to ensure the personal insolvency practitioners remain 100% impartial in their dealings with clients.  How will the Government ensure these practitioners remain independent?</P>
        <P>The proposal to reduce the term of automatic discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to three in the case of a judicial petition for bankruptcy is a progressive step.  The new mortgage arrears support unit should be integrated with the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, whose existing structures are invaluable.  Such a move would also ensure more one-to-one contact because MABS has the personnel available with the required experience.  It seems that with the proposals for the new unit, the emphasis will be on electronic communications with uncertainty regarding staffing levels and the unit&rsquo;s staff being available to meet with mortgage holders in difficulty.</P>
        <P>A new consultation paper on reforming the credit reporting system argues the State should take control of it.  If and when the new credit register comes into force, how will people be protected from this new State body forcing people to pay non-credit bills such as property taxes and the like?  Could the State use the new system to blackmail people to pay their property taxes against a threat of a bad credit reference?</P>
        <P>How will people be protected against unscrupulous banks which may unfairly reject their payment plans?  The banks and financial institutions will have to show compassion.  The veto option for the banks and financial institutions will have to be amended.  All the Bill&rsquo;s provisions must leave ample flexibility to ensure citizens are engaged in an affordable and working debt resolution process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to what has been a very lengthy Second Stage debate.  There were many and positive contributions spanning across a range of issues in respect of the legislation, in particular with regard to the serious difficulties many of our citizens are confronted by with regard to indebtedness.  It is clear from the various contributions made by Members that they are often at the forefront of hearing of these difficulties and seeking ways to resolve them.  <i>n</i> recent years every Member has had to deal with constituents under substantial financial pressure who cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to present the Personal Insolvency Bill which is significant and legally complex legislation providing for the comprehensive reform and modernisation of our insolvency law and practice.  It provides for new and more flexible options to address the circumstances of insolvent debtors.  It addresses in a balanced and proportionate way the obligations of debtors as well as the rights of creditors, having regard to the financial reality of individual circumstances.  It will incentivise both parties to come to an agreed solution.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to provide for the reform of personal insolvency law and introduce three non-judicial debt resolution processes, namely, the debt relief notice, the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement.  To protect the constitutional rights of all concerned, the Bill makes provision for enhanced oversight by the Circuit Court or the High Court in cases where the debts concerned exceed &euro;2.5 million.</P>
        <P>Deputies will appreciate reform of our personal insolvency regime is not a simple task.  It is a very complex area of the law and one in which the consequences and implications of new policies need to be carefully assessed.  We must get the balance right between the legal rights of the various parties involved.  The system has to be fair to both creditors and debtors alike.  Otherwise, we risk making worse a situation which is already difficult for the parties concerned.  In this debate it seems it is always assumed creditors are financial institutions.  The reality is that in many instances creditors are ordinary individuals owed money by other individuals in financial difficulties.  Often, it also puts them into difficult financial circumstances, resulting in them being weighed down by debt.  It is extraordinary how little of that aspect was addressed during the debate, with the sole focus instead being on financial institutions.  The debt resolution process must provide solutions which are appropriate to the level of an individual&rsquo;s indebtedness and based on his or her ability to make payments.</P>
        <P>A great number of Deputies contributed to the debate; certainly too many to be able to refer to every individual point raised.  I hope those Deputies whose contributions I do not mention specifically will forgive me for not doing so.  There are some Deputies&rsquo; contributions to which I do intend to refer specifically.  The issue of the bank veto was raised by many of the Deputies who criticised the Bill as giving an effective veto to banks which would impact on personal insolvency arrangements and debt settlement arrangements.  This is a somewhat simplistic reasoning and misses a major point.  While there is no denying that creditors can veto the reaching of a personal insolvency arrangement through the weighted provisions with regard to voting at creditor meetings, the new measures taken by the Government also give the debtor a veto.  This comes in the form of a significant change to the bankruptcy law.  This change has been gainsaid by some Members as not being a balancing factor.  I very much suggest, however, it will be in the future operation of debt resolution and will be a very particular and important balancing factor to the benefit of debtors.</P>
        <P>We have seen in recent times the so-called bankruptcy tourists travelling to the UK to be declared bankrupt there because bankruptcy in Ireland has been so harsh.  By reducing the term of automatic discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to three, it greatly strengthens the hand of debtors in their dealings with the banks.  If a creditor refuses to engage fully and fairly where debts become unsustainable or refuses to agree a responsible personal insolvency agreement, then there is the option for the debtor to file for bankruptcy and, if successful, he or she can be relieved of the unsustainable debts within three years.  The reality is this legislation will force financial institutions to take a more realistic view of how to address issues of unsustainable debt in circumstances where substantial sums are owed and individuals are simply unable to pay them.  This seems to be a matter some Deputies are unable to grasp.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a hope of that provision working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Deputies spoke about developing some form of non-judicial independent agency or process to adjudicate, arbitrate or act as an appeals process in a binding fashion in regard to debt settlement between creditors and debtors.  However, the new debt resolution processes are designed to operate on a voluntary basis with common sense and enlightened self-interest in mind rather than coercion.  I know of no such example of the type of body that appears to be demanded by some Members or suggested in a recent Private Members&rsquo; Bill existing in any jurisdiction.  No Deputy has been able to give an example of such a body.  There is good reason for that.  Such a body would be struck down by the courts as a gross interference in the rights of parties to conduct their affairs.  Perhaps those preparing Committee Stage amendments in this regard will enlighten us in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>They might also address what they now propose will impact on individuals who are creditors and entitled to moneys outstanding and due to them as a consequence of work they have carried out, services they have provided or products they have manufactured or sold.  That is a point which no Deputy who raised this issue attempted to address at any stage.  The State cannot impose a settlement on parties to a private contract involving the provision of goods, services or capital.  The concerned parties must seek agreement.  The only potential State involvement is in the provision of the judicial bankruptcy process.  Either agreed arrangements are entered into or we have a courts system in which adjudications can take place in the context of bankruptcy.  It is not possible to have something that is both agreed and compelled simultaneously.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to personal insolvency practitioners.  These individuals will have a key role to play in the negotiation of realistic, workable and mutually acceptable agreements between debtors and creditors.  I expect that when the new debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes are up and running, there will be a very high agreement rate.  Why will this be the case?  It is because it makes sense and is the best option likely to be available.  The alternative option may be bankruptcy.  I am sure most persons involved in debt resolution processes would agree that the latter is best avoided.</P>
        <P>When financial institutions finally come to address the position of debtors in a serious way, they may discover that they will recover greater sums through agreeing personal insolvency arrangements rather than forcing them into bankruptcy.  The benefit of the personal insolvency arrangement for debtors revolves around the specific provisions contained in the legislation which will facilitate homes being retained and debtors being allowed to reside in them, with the prospect &mdash; after a period of years &mdash; of finding themselves back in a sustainable and viable financial position.  In that context, the Bill specifically provides for enhanced protection for a debtor in regard to his or her principal private residence.  Many speakers who were critical of the provisions contained in the Bill appear to have missed this point.  In fairness, it was addressed by the majority of Members who fully understood the important implications of that particular provision.  In the case of the Opposition, Deputy Stephen Donnelly did valuable work in producing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill relating to this matter and has recognised that what is proposed is a genuine and real protection for those who have homes, are in financial difficulty and require assistance.  The provisions contained in the legislation send a very specific and particular message to financial institutions.</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify that the proposal of a personal insolvency arrangement in respect of a principal private residence is not limited to financial institutions.  It could concern housing provided by local authorities, for example, in the context of shared ownership schemes.</P>
        <P>The proposed regulation of personal insolvency practitioners was raised by a number of Members.  I indicated in my opening contribution that further provisions would be necessary for these individuals.  Personal insolvency practitioners will be central to the negotiation of debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements.  Part 5 of the Bill includes an enabling provision relating to these practitioners.  As stated, I will be bringing forward more detailed proposals in respect of them on Committee Stage.  These proposals will deal with the type of persons who will qualify for regulation &mdash; whether by designated professional bodies or otherwise &mdash; as personal insolvency practitioners.  It is clear that a broad probity test and proper indemnity will be required.  However, I would be wary of seeking to, as some Deputies suggested, bar people based solely on their former roles in different financial sectors.  While I understand the sentiments expressed, such a course of action would likely give rise to a judicial review and consequent difficulties in implementing the legislation.</P>
        <P>The issue of the payment of personal insolvency practitioners also &mdash; properly &mdash; arose during the debate.  Such practitioners are normally paid from the product of the insolvency process.  Their fees will be subject to negotiation by the creditors and have to be set out in a transparent manner for all concerned.  I would be opposed to fees being charged as a percentage of an outstanding debt.  I do not believe that would be tolerated by either debtors or creditors.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Fees should be charged on a proper professional basis.  Deputies may be aware that this issue has settled down in the context of the operation of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s individual voluntary arrangement which is similar, in practical terms, to our proposed debt settlement arrangement.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies raised queries about the debt relief notice, DRN.  I am happy to offer further clarifications in this regard.  Effectively, a DRN is a lower level, cost-effective alternative to judicial bankruptcy in respect of certain qualifying debts, primarily those involving unsecured credit up to a maximum of &euro;20,000.  A debtor will be able to make an application through an approved intermediary such as the MABS, setting out in detail his or her financial circumstances.  On examination and verification by the insolvency service, this will be deemed to be in order and sent to the court for approval.  Once approved, the debts covered by a DRN will be forgiven in full and no repayment will be required.  This is the important point.  However, in line with the revised period of automatic discharge from bankruptcy and also in view of the rights of creditors, there will be a supervision period of three years.  If the debtor&rsquo;s circumstances improve during that period by whatever means, he or she may be required to offer repayments up to a total of no more than 50% of the full forgiven debt for the benefit of creditors.  This is a very sensible and humane approach and will offer hope to those who have little prospect of getting out from under what seem to them to be crushing debt burdens.  Strict conditions, including those relating to fraudulent behaviour, are prescribed.</P>
        <P>The amounts applying in respect of allowable disposable monthly income, namely, less than &euro;60 after payment of reasonable living expenses and assets with a value of less than &euro;400, were criticised by Deputies as being too low.  However, the purpose of a DRN is to specifically help those who have very little and not those who may have certain assets which could be sold in order to make some repayment to creditors.  By assets, I do not mean essential household items required for normal living.  We may ultimately be obliged to provide some indicative guidance in this regard but I am of the view that the range of such items can be easily comprehended.</P>
        <P>Creditors will not only be financial institutions &mdash; I include credit unions in this regard &mdash; but may also be local supermarkets, co-operatives, tradesmen awaiting payment for goods or services or a wide variety of individuals whose own personal circumstances are threatened and detrimentally impacted upon by the failure of a debtor to make payments for work done.</P>

Is anyone seriously suggesting a wedding ring which cost &euro;200 or &euro;300 would fall into the category of an expensive item of jewellery?</P>

	<P>That is very insulting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of the development of reasonable living expenditure guidelines in the context of the insolvency process.  I agree that this is an important element of the process.  I also agree with those Deputies who noted the difficulty of setting down definitive amounts to apply to all cases, when we know that insolvency must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  The issue of guidelines will have to be addressed.  I would take a particular view of any financial institution that adopts a practice of concluding that the funds to be retained by an individual for living purposes should equate directly with what he or she would receive on social welfare.  An individual who is earning an income must have the capacity to retain a reasonable lifestyle and to be rewarded for the work he or she does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends if they are married or divorced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue is of great importance in the context of this legislation.  I am concerned by reports that some financial institutions, in addressing issues of indebtedness and seeking to enter voluntary arrangements with customers who are in major financial difficulty, have suggested that an adequate income for individuals who are working should be no more than what they would receive on social welfare.  I think that is entirely unacceptable.  That is one of the reasons we may need to put guidelines in place in this area.  The sum that an individual will normally retain as part of this type of arrangement &mdash; a personal insolvency arrangement, a debt settlement arrangement or a bankruptcy &mdash; will vary on the basis of his or her circumstances.  It will depend on a range of issues including: whether the person is married; has a dependent spouse; or has any children and, if so, how old they are.  The issues that arise should be dealt with on a subjective and individualised basis.  Guidelines might be needed to ensure individuals are protected from unreasonable demands being made on them.  I would not underestimate the difficulties involved in dealing with this issue.  In countries that have more advanced insolvency legislation than we have had to date, this issue has been worked out in practical terms once the legislation has settled down.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with a number of other issues.  The external insolvency environment, particularly in the context of the United Kingdom, was mentioned during the course of the debate.  Issues relating to insolvency are not confined to what occurs in the UK.  For example, the European Union intends to bring forward proposals later this year to amend the current insolvency regulation, as agreed in 2000, which deals with both corporate and personal insolvency.  I await the proposals of the European Commission with interest.  I will be vigorously involved ensuring the best possible measure is put in place to apply across the European Union.  Our efforts in this Bill could provide a very useful blueprint.  I noted the concerns expressed by Deputies about the different approach taken to insolvency, particularly with regard to bankruptcy, in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  This is a matter over which we have no control.  All indications are, frankly, that bankruptcy law in the UK is unlikely to change in the short term.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to assure Deputies that the proposed insolvency service, while under the broad remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, will be an independent body and will carry out its required functions with regard to the determination, processing and registration of the new debt resolution processes, in a professional and impartial manner.  That is as it should be, given the absolute need for confidentiality and the fiduciary duties that are involved.  I emphasise that there will be no role for intervention by a third party, even a public representative or a Minister, in the operation of the debt resolution processes.  Allowing any such potential intervention in an individual case could contribute to a negative result.  The service will produce a strategy statement and business plan.  Its director will appear as required before relevant Oireachtas committees.  This is similar to the operation of other agencies.  Like other Deputies, I would like to commend the work of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Stanton, published a review of the draft scheme of the Bill in January.  The text of the published Bill reflects in large part the concerns of the committee.  While I understand the committee may wish to revisit the insolvency area, I am conscious of the tight timetable that will be ahead of us in the autumn.  We hope to propose appropriate amendments to the Bill as early as possible following the convening of the D&aacute;il after the summer recess.  I hope they will be addressed on Committee Stage, which will take place within the joint committee.  It is at that stage that all further issues of a substantive and technical nature can be properly teased out.  I believe this Bill is a comprehensive package.  I have no intention of taking out the bankruptcy element, as suggested by at least one speaker, and enacting it as separate legislation.  I do not believe this would be a good idea.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies mentioned the potential impact of this reform on credit unions.  Unfortunately, credit unions, like all other financial institutions, have made some poor lending decisions in recent years.  They will face repayment difficulties as a result.  I have no intention of providing special treatment for them over and above any other creditor.  I agree with those Deputies who were rightly critical of past and current behaviour of Irish financial institutions.  In many cases in the recent past, the poor and insensitive responses of the institutions have compounded the distress of debtors who have found themselves in difficult circumstances.  We need the Irish banking sector to get its act together rapidly and to engage fully and professionally with its clients to arrive at solutions that can work to everyone&rsquo;s benefit and that of the wider economy.  As one Deputy remarked, we need them &ldquo;to get real&rdquo;.  The banks have assured us that they will be up to the task of working the new insolvency process.  That remains to be seen.  It remains the position that when the banks try to engage voluntarily with customers, consistent options are not available to them.  Different options are provided by different banks.  The reality remains that the banks, separately and internally, have no consistent policy for dealing with those who are totally weighed down by indebtedness and are facing circumstances in which is appropriate to write down debt.  In the context of the personal insolvency arrangement, in some circumstances it will be appropriate for some level of debt to be written down if banks are to recoup some portion of the money they lent and if individuals are to get back on their feet.</P>
        <P>It is time banks came to terms with this reality in the context of stress testing of banks and the recapitalisation, which included provision for this as a possibility for those whose debts are unsustainable and who genuinely cannot pay and where, without such write-down, there is little prospect of people getting back on their feet without the bankruptcy option, which should not be necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what the banks are saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of the review period of the operation of the Bill, of ten years, was raised.  It was reasonable for Deputies to make the points they made in this regard.  In the context of the complexity of the legislation, the new non-judicial debt relief arrangements proposed and the novelty of the personal insolvency arrangement, which does not apply in other jurisdictions, it is reasonable to review this legislation within a period of less than ten years.  Within three to four years of the legislation being in place, it will be necessary to review it.</P>
        <P>I specifically refer to points made by some Members that I have not addressed in my general comments.  I made reference to Deputy Stephen Donnelly&rsquo;s speech, where he detailed his support for the Bill but raised a number of issues he hoped we will address.  I responded to that in the general comments made.  Deputy Michael McGrath read out a letter sent by a financial institution to a constituent.  I share his concerns about the nature of the correspondence.  During the course of the debate, other Members referred to correspondence sent by banks.  In circumstances in which individuals are in two or three months of mortgage repayment arrears, it is not appropriate that the first communication from a bank is a letter that threatens to repossess the house.  The current bank guidelines do not anticipate banks conducting themselves in this way and there must be more constructive engagement than that initially.  Individuals in difficulty with repayments of the loans should not wait for the bank to contact them; they should contact the bank to see if difficulties can be addressed.  There are substantial numbers of individuals not making capital and interest repayments on mortgages where they are in genuine financial difficulties and banks have entered into temporary arrangements.  The worst case is where the payments cease and the customer does not engage directly with the financial institution.  It is important that the initial engagement by the bank is more constructive than an immediate threat to repossess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister going to force them to do it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy David Stanton made a point with which I agree, making reference to the need to ensure consistency of approach across financial institutions and the need for an overarching bank protocol.  The banks and financial institutions each have an individual legal identity and may have different approaches in certain circumstances.  There is a need for consistency within the banks because I have heard reports that when two people in financial difficulty approach their local bank managers, the response in one part of the country is better than in another part.  There is a particular need for consistency, expertise and awareness of how to deal appropriately with individuals genuinely unable to pay, doing their best in genuine difficulty and who, if they are given some initial assistance, have a reasonable prospect of working their way out of the difficulty if new arrangements of a practical nature can be agreed.</P>
        <P>I refer to the contribution of Deputy Ross, who said the legislation was dominated by bank thinking, which is curious because the Irish Banking Federation representatives expressed opposition to various parts of the legislation and appear to be unhappy with it.  He suggested the legislation should break the power of the banks.  That is a nice populist notion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ross is never populist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of us recognise it is important that we have a proper, functioning banking system.  Deputy Ross&rsquo;s contribution could be summed up as suggesting banks should lend money to individuals, that the individuals to whom money is lent &mdash; regardless of circumstances &mdash; should never have an obligation to repay it and that the taxpayers should carry the losses incurred within the banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is who the banks serve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone should tell Deputy Ross.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That sums up the view of Deputy Ross and I am sure he will be delighted with the support of Deputy Finian McGrath.  The contribution of Deputy Ross could be best described as populist poppycock and I expect something better from a Deputy who presents himself as a business editor in a Sunday newspaper.</P>

	<P>Deputy Ross is not even here to defend himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The House appears to be still sitting so, if he had a genuine interest in the Bill, he would be here to defend himself.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to conclude my consideration of the main themes raised during the debate by referring to a point raised by a number of Deputies.  The point can be summarised by questioning why a person paying all of his or her debts, and who did not go mad, should pay for the indulgence of others and why he or she should bail them out.  That is a very fair point in the context of home mortgages.  Approximately 20% of those paying mortgages are in financial difficulties or are parties to new arrangements with financial institutions.  Approximately 80% of mortgage holders are up to date in their mortgage repayments.  It is understandable that they would ask why should provision be made to assist those in financial difficulties.  The response is: if we do not extend the hand of help, hope and friendship to indebted neighbours, who else will?  We must not adopt a dog in the manger approach.</P>

	<P>We need to get the economy moving for the benefit of society and we need to recognise that individuals are in insubstantial difficulty, many through no fault of their own, and this legislation is designed to be of assistance to them.  The legislation is designed to assist those who cannot pay as opposed to those who will not pay.  Some of the contributions made by Members, particularly those in the Technical Group, seem to be based on the assumption that even if one can pay debts, one does not need to.</P>

	<P>In the period after the end of the Second World War, in one of the great humanitarian gestures, help was offered in Europe through the Marshall plan to friend and foe alike with the objective of getting Europe back on its feet and into productive activity.  The implications and desired outcomes of the new insolvency process that I am providing in this Bill try in their own way to achieve that greater objective and to get those in genuine difficulty back on their feet to give them hope for the future.  It offers a hand-up to those who need it most.</P>

	<P>Deputies should be assured that while the Bill does not offer an easy way out, it does offer a way out by means of the proper application and implementation of the provisions contained therein.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with the law and procedures necessary to operate a modern personal insolvency process.  While there are other matters, many of them not insignificant, connected with the problem of indebtedness, insolvency law cannot, <i>per se</i>, deal with them.  Other relevant relief measures are being developed by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The focus of this Bill is, by definition, confined to insolvency.  It is not, however, solely concerned with those who are currently in financial difficulties.  Rather, it is about dealing in the future with those who find themselves in difficulty for a wide variety of reasons and providing a new legal architecture that will facilitate addressing those difficulties in a proportionate and fair manner as between debtors and creditors.</P>
        <P>There is much work to be done in a limited amount of time in finalising not only the text of the Bill but in putting in place the required administrative and operational guidelines and in the establishment of the new insolvency service.  The benefit of the Bill is that it will assist in bringing some peace of mind to those debtors who are at their wit&rsquo;s end and fearing there is no hope.  That is a very serious consideration in view of the research showing that financial difficulties can be a contributing factor in respect of suicides.  In that context, I am obliged to comment on the extraordinary contribution by Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome any constructive amendments from Members which would improve the text of the Bill.  I ask, however, that Deputies, before bringing forward proposals, would reflect on their implications and the extent to which they might genuinely improve the legislation to the benefit of the wider community and having regard to the rights of both debtors and creditors, as opposed to simply proposing amendments that have no basis in reality and are designed to do nothing other than make some crass political point.  Any proposal must contribute to the workability of the Bill and have regard to the essential fairness required in order to ensure a balance of rights.  There is little point in bringing forward proposals that may seem on the face of it to be overly debtor friendly if they have little practical chance of success and could operate very unfairly in respect of individuals who are creditors and whose own financial circumstances are placed in difficulty by the failure of others to pay moneys due to them.</P>
        <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this important debate.  They can be assured that the work does not stop here but will continue during the summer recess in preparation for Committee Stage.  The objective is to have the legislation enacted before the end of the year, in sufficient time to ensure it is available to those who need it.  In the intervening period, I hope those financial institutions which have not properly engaged with customers in genuine financial difficulty, instead of waiting for the Bill to be enacted, will now engage in a far more constructive manner than they have done to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 24, 28, 37, 44 and 198 together. </P>
        <P>Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr Conor Skehan, Chair of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association (TCCA), Bord na M&oacute;na, and representatives of turf-cutting and environmental groups.  This Forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf-cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog.</P>
        <P>In his report, Justice Quirke recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are to be protected.  This recommendation was agreed to by Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members&rsquo; Motion, which called for such a national plan to be put in place within the terms of the Habitats Directive.  On the 3rd of April last, a delegation led by Minister Hogan and I met with EU Environment Commissioner Poto&egrave;nik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.</P>
        <P>The Plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving, restoring and managing the affected bogs and will allow solutions for turf-cutters to be explored in detail.  In the context of such a Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites.  The Plan will be progressed both at local level for each site and at national level through the Peatlands Council.</P>
        <P>With specific regard to Question No. 8, I assume the derogation the Deputy refers to is that which was applied to raised bog SACs.  In its infringement action against Ireland, the European Commission contended that the derogation granted by then Minister S&iacute;le de Valera was a contravention of EU law.  Accordingly, I am advised that an extension to the derogation, or allowing for continued turf-cutting while the Plan is being prepared, is not legally possible.</P>
        <P>While the over-whelming majority of turf-cutters on raised bog SACS have complied with the law this year, some unauthorised turf-cutting has been undertaken.  Such matters will be addressed through prosecution and cross-reporting processes.  The State may also pursue contractors and turf-cutters involved in damage to raised bog SACs, to meet the costs of remediating any environmental damage done.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place a flexible package of compensation for affected turf cutters.  Those who choose to cease cutting turf completely can apply for compensation of &euro;1,500 per annum for the next 15 years.  Eligible cutters are also entitled to a one-off payment of &euro;500 for this year.  This means the total compensation package is worth &euro;23,000, index linked and tax-free.</P>
        <P>For those who wish to continue cutting, my Department is working to relocate turf cutters to alternative, undesignated bogs.  Turf has now been cut on the first of these relocation bogs and others are being prepared, or are being identified in consultation with affected cutters.  Where relocation bogs are not yet available, turf-cutters can choose between a &euro;1,500 payment, or the delivery of 15 tonnes of turf, each year while the relocation bog is being identified, acquired and prepared for cutting.  They will also be entitled to the one-off &euro;500 payment.  To date, more than 2,250 applications for compensation or relocation have been received by my Department, with payments issued to some 840 applicants to date.</P>
        <P>My Department is maintaining ongoing contact with the European Commission in response to the infringement action and will continue to work closely with it in the development of the National Plan.</P>
        <P>My Department is also in contact with several turf-cutting groups, seeking long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs.  This process will continue as part of the preparation of the National Plan.  The Peatlands Council, which comprises turf-cutter, land-owner and environmental stakeholder groups, is continuing with its important work.  However, given that the TCCA regrettably withdrew from the Peatlands Council last autumn and has, since March, maintained a position of non-involvement, I would again urge the TCCA to consider whether it could more effectively represent its members&rsquo; interests through engaging with the Government and other relevant partners.</P>

	<P>The Culture Programme is the EU support programme for organisations working in the field of culture.  There are Cultural Contact Points in each of the participating countries of the EU Culture Programme.  Their role is to provide information, advice and technical assistance to anyone in the country interested in applying to the EU for funding under the Culture Programme 2007-2013.  The CCP in Ireland is based at the Arts Council.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, Irish cultural organisations have been involved in 33 EU projects that have received grants in excess of &euro;15.6m from the Culture Programme.  The Irish take of these grants is estimated to be in the region of &euro;3.3m.Recent statistics show that Ireland&rsquo;s participation is improving and organisations are now more likely to look to Europe for funding.  Overall, the picture is optimistic for Irish application levels to gain a critical mass in the near future, judging by the increased level of interest in the past three years.</P>
        <P>An examination of the report by Euclid International does not support the claim that Ireland is bottom of the EU Culture Programme league table.  Ireland&rsquo;s percentage take from the Programme is broadly in line with our population size and, by the report&rsquo;s own admission, there are a number of difficulties in providing any definitive analysis.</P>

My officials are liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the filling of this post on a permanent basis.  When sanctioned by that Department, it is intended that the position will be filled by means of an open competition conducted through the Public Appointments Service.</P>
        <P>In relation to the position of CEO of Culture Ireland, the Deputy will be aware that this position has recently been filled on an acting basis for a period of 15 months.  In the Government&rsquo;s <i>Public Service Reform Plan</i> of 17 November 2011, Culture Ireland is listed as an entity to be critically reviewed in the context of its functions being merged into my Department.  Consultations are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard, with a view to the matter being further considered by Government at the appropriate time.</P>

        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the Australian Government&rsquo;s initiative regarding Arts and Culture, which had been designed to radically change the country&rsquo;s creative landscape over a ten year period with the specific aim of creating a more enlightened, cohesive and creative citizenry; his plans to introduce a similar initiative in Ireland by way of a national cultural policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit. </P>
        <P><i>The Programme for Government 2011-2016, </i>along with my Department&rsquo;s <i>Statement of Strategy,</i> has the overall goal of promoting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad, and maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the country<b>.</b></P>
        <P>As the Deputy will know, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and my Department has no role to play in its executive or funding decisions.</P>
        <P>I understand, however, that Arts Council members and staff have met their Australian counterparts on several occasions in recent years, and remain in contact with them and arts practitioners in other countries.  The Arts Council continues to monitor arts developments throughout the world and adopt good practice, where practicable.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, and 23 together.</P>
        <P>Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts.  The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting these properties require my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  The landowner&rsquo;s application to my Department for consent to proposals that envisage the retention of the buildings and the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising is being examined.  In that context, I have visited the site and met various interest groups, including relatives of the 1916 Leaders.</P>
        <P>As part of the consent process, in accordance with the <i>European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment of Proposed Demolition of National Monuments) Regulations 2012</i>, which I made last week, the consent applicant has been asked by my Department to submit an environmental impact statement in relation to any elements of the proposal that would involve demolition works.  The Regulations introduce new provisions into the National Monuments Acts to provide for the carrying out of an environmental impact assessment in relation to any works to a national monument requiring my consent under those Acts that involve an element of demolition. Following receipt of the environmental impact statement, and having completed the prescribed consultation procedures, I will undertake a formal environmental impact assessment before making a decision on the consent application.</P>
        <P>Any wider plans for the development of the Moore Street area would be a matter for the relevant landowners and the development authority, Dublin City Council.  I have no statutory function in relation to the operations of the National Assets Management Agency.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, in the current economic circumstances, the Government is faced with difficult decisions with regard to framing budgets for expenditure.  In order to ensure that the best use is made of limited financial resources and to provide a basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation, the Government embarked on a detailed Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) in 2011.  The objectives of the CRE were to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives, both as regards spending and numbers reduction targets;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />to re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />in this context, to consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the context of public sector reform.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Within this context, my Department&rsquo;s allocations reflect the outcome of both the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the Review of Capital Expenditure carried out last year.  While my Department&rsquo;s 2012 REV Allocation of &euro;268.451m represents a 9% reduction when compared with the 2011 provisional out-turn, to the greatest extent possible, savings are being largely achieved through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services and my Department continues to place emphasis on:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />supporting jobs in the film and TV sector and in the Gaeltacht;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />targeting investment in priority areas in the culture and heritage sectors that will support cultural tourism as one of the most important elements of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />complying with EU Directives, including investment in alternative solutions for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in Special Areas of Conservation; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />supporting the built heritage, strategic developments in our National Parks and the development of our waterways in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday and St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am satisfied that it will be possible to continue to make good progress and to facilitate promotional efforts appropriately, on foot of the prudent use of available funding.</P>

Officials from my Department are in contact with the management of the Abbey Theatre on progress in relation to the asbestos removal works.  I understand that the requisite removal work has been completed in respect of the Peacock Theatre area of the Abbey complex and that work will commence this week on the removal of asbestos from the Abbey auditorium.  I am advised that this work, which is taking place under appropriate expert supervision, should be completed by early September.  In the interim, I understand that the Abbey Theatre&rsquo;s production of Sean O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Plough and the Stars&rdquo; will be relocated to the O&rsquo;Reilly Theatre on Great Denmark Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department&rsquo;s Mission Statement includes the promotion and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and culture. In this regard, our national cultural institutions are a key part of cultural landscape and contribute hugely to the overall well-being of our society.  Through their collections, staffing and contribution to knowledge, they are essential building blocks of the cultural identity and creativity of our country.  </P>
        <P>My Department also support a number of regional museums, galleries and cultural centres throughout the country, which complement the work of our national cultural institutions. In addition to this, there are a number of specific initiatives which are designed to increase cultural participation and inclusiveness in our cities and towns. For example, for the last number of years, my Department has provided funding towards the Culture Night initiative.  This initiative has continued to grow on a yearly basis and in 2011 a record 30 towns and cities throughout the island of Ireland participated, showcasing the best of our artistic and cultural heritage.  Plans for Culture Night 2012 are well advanced and it is hoped that this year&rsquo;s event will build on the success and popularity of previous years to create a unique offering of memorable experiences involving local arts, culture and heritage communities, which will hopefully stimulate repeat visits to cultural attractions.</P>
        <P>The National Museum also supports an active programme of loans from its collections to local and regional museums throughout the country. My Department also operates a mobility of collections scheme under which funding is made available for local/regional galleries and museums for particular costs associated with collaborative projects with the National Cultural Institutions.</P>
        <P>On the heritage side, my Department is currently promoting the role which Ireland&rsquo;s heritage has to play in making our country an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, both in terms of the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s national parks and nature reserves, and in terms of our unique built heritage, which distinguishes us and which makes Ireland an attractive tourist location for both visitors and Irish people themselves. Cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product and heritage properties, including those in State care, are an important element of that attraction.</P>
        <P>My Department provides some limited funding under a number of headings for investment in the built and natural heritage, and also supports the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust in their work in the heritage area. However, the scope to provide additional funding for the protection, conservation and development of the State&rsquo;s built heritage is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances. My Department is, therefore, focusing on working creatively across Government and with partner bodies, such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the LEADER Programme and other heritage interests, in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector. My Department will also continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department and other Government Departments have put substantial work and funding towards the conservation of the corncrake in the Shannon Callows. This includes agri-environment payments to farmers, research into the needs of this species and cause for its decline, and grant-aid to a leading NGO to have field workers on site over the summer months for many years. The key areas used by corncrakes in the Callows were designated as a Special Protection Area, under the EU Birds Directive. </P>
        <P>The agri-environment schemes which have been used include a Corncrake Grant Scheme, measures under REPS, the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme and further top-up payments and emergency measures. These were deemed necessary as the bird requires hay meadows or similar vegetation to live in, but nests are destroyed by cutting and so, for the bird to survive, farmers must cut the crop later than would be normal.</P>
        <P>In spite of these measures, heavy rainfall led to flooding of the lands in the summers of 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2008, causing a great decline in the population. Only the calling males can be detected: the number fell from 23 in 2005 to just 2 in 2010 and only one in 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P>Conservation efforts are still ongoing in this SPA. Existing contracts are being honoured in the NPWS scheme, but as the scheme budget is curtailed, no new plans are currently being entered into.</P>
        <P>The Middle Shannon Callows SPA is unique among the Corncrake SPAs in having early and mid season cover in abundance and throughout the site. There is no need to create such cover for Corncrake. This site will continue to be monitored on an annual basis and the Corncrake Grant Scheme will be used if birds are suspected to be breeding on the Callows.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to publish data relating to public spending which would indicate the contribution made by the Arts to combatting poverty and exclusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.  I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies within its remit. </P>
        <P><i>The Programme for Government 2011-2016, </i>along with my Department&rsquo;s <i>Statement of Strategy,</i> has the overall goal of promoting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad, and maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the country.</P>
        <P>My Department is, therefore, actively engaged in promoting the benefit of arts and culture to the wider community throughout the country. Our mandate seeks to promote access to and participation in, the arts by all sections of Irish society and to support our national cultural institutions in their work to preserve, protect and present our heritage and cultural assets. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that I have no statutory function in relation to poverty and exclusion.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will know, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council, as the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />to stimulate public interest in the arts;</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="mdash66" />to assist in improving standards in the arts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Arts Council is a statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.  I understand that, while the Arts Council does not have any specific initiatives in place the sole purpose of which would be to combat poverty or promote social inclusion, inclusion and wide social access to the arts has long been a core value of the Arts Council The outcome of this can be seen in the Council&rsquo;s funding decisions across all art forms and areas of arts practice and, in particular, in the funding through Arts Participation grants and in the grants for arts activity for Young People, Children and Education. Furthermore, the Council recently considered the matter of social inclusion and has identified the twin areas of <i>Education</i> and of <i>Public Access and Engagement</i>   as priorities. It is also the case that the Arts Council&rsquo;s long-standing partnership with local authorities throughout the country is premised in part on the understanding that local authority arts programmes often seek to address those sections of society with little or limited access to the arts.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on his recent allocation of &euro;712,000 for the protection of vulnerable structures; if he will consider initiating a nationwide audit of vulnerable sites in view of the current status, for example, of sites such as the historic Belcamp College, Dublin 17; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the scope to provide financial support for the State&rsquo;s heritage assets is constrained by the current significant reduction in the public finances.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow.</P>
        <P>In 2012, my Department is providing &euro;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a Structures at Risk Fund. The Fund is intended to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000-2012 and, in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas.  I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently approved offers of funding to 41 conservation projects in 27 local authority areas under the Structures at Risk Fund.  Details of projects in receipt of grant-aid offers will shortly be available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.ahg.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>This year, in a complementary initiative, my Department introduced a Special Projects Fund.  This Fund is administered directly by my Department and is intended to assist with works to safeguard structures of significant special interest protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012.  The total amount available under the Fund in 2012 is &euro;272,000.  To date, I have committed &euro;212,000 from the fund for conservation works to the internationally important St. Fin Barre&rsquo;s Cathedral in Cork city.</P>
        <P>With regard to the matter of initiating a nationwide audit of vulnerable structures, I wish to advise the Deputy of mechanisms in place centrally and locally to protect our shared architectural heritage. Under the provisions of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures.  The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.  Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them, seek to safeguard their future and serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures.  Section 59 of the Act provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of such structures.  In the context of the foregoing, my Department does not collate comprehensive information on the numbers of vulnerable sites throughout the State.</P>
        <P>Finally, as regards current and ongoing initiatives to assist in the safeguarding of our built heritage, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to several key developments.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />My Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisery Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently concluding a review of the operation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000-2012.  The review examined how this legislation is operating in practice regarding the protection and management of architectural heritage from a central and local government perspective and the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to consider alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Separately, in the context of the Government Policy on Architecture 2009-2015, my Department is developing various policy actions which contribute to the protection and appropriate re-use of our built heritage and aims to deal with on-going strategic objectives indirectly effecting our architectural heritage such as adaptive re-use for historic properties and a forward plan-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 49 together. </P>
        <P>The National Archives building at Bishop Street, along with the associated facility at the Four Courts, is the permanent home for the National Archives. While there have been issues with the Bishop Street building over the years, my Department, with the Office of Public Works (which has overall responsibility for the building), has endeavored to improve the facilities there. Over the last year, almost &euro;700,000 has been spent to replace the roof and defective shutters to make the warehouse watertight and to upgrade the quality of storage in the Four Courts.  This work is key to safeguarding the State&rsquo;s archives and will be the first stage of a phased improvement scheme that will maximise the internal storage capacity of the Bishop Street facility.  I am currently awaiting a costed scheme from the Office of Public Works in that regard.</P>
        <P>While I have met with the Chair and Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland and had a constructive engagement &mdash; which will continue &mdash; on the potential use of the Bank of Ireland building at College Green, that building remains in the ownership of the Bank. There are no plans envisaged to re-locate the National Archives to this location, as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I recognise the role that our national cultural institutions, including the National Archives, can play regarding the Government&rsquo;s Decade of Centenaries 2012 to 2022 programme. In that context, my Department is engaged with the institutions on the development of an appropriate commemorative programme. I have also written to certain national cultural associations with a view to them contributing to the Programme and I will consult further as the programme develops.</P>
        <P>While <i>The Gathering</i>   event is an initiative of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am conscious of the potential of our places of natural beauty, our national monuments and our sources of genealogy for attracting the Irish Diaspora to our shores. I have no doubt that all the appropriate bodies, including the cultural institutions, will play an important role in this regard.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce a cultural rights framework that would have the capacity to foster self expression, self esteem, creativity and civic participation, a rights system that would have the capacity to take account of the human person, especially of those voices unheard or marginalised in our society; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>While I have no particular plans to introduce a cultural rights framework or rights system as described by the Deputy, I acknowledge that the issues referred to form part of the essence of cultural and artistic expression in this country.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Cultural Institutions are a key part of the cultural landscape. Through their collections, staffing and contribution to knowledge, they are essential building blocks in the cultural identity and creativity of Ireland.  While education and access are operational matters for the institutions themselves, I am aware that these issues are taken very seriously by them. Through their education and outreach programmes, the institutions strive to ensure that the collections and resources are accessible to all sectors of our society. In addition, broadening accessibility to the arts is, of course, at the heart of Arts Council policy.  </P>

	<P>In 2009, after the Admiral Kuznetsov incident, the issue was discussed with the authorities of the Russian Federation in Dublin and in Moscow.   This issue has been raised with the Russian authorities, including at senior official level earlier this year.  It is our understanding, however, that following a letter from the Admiral Commander in Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation to the Director of the Irish Coast Guard, outlining the results of an official investigation carried out and assurances that such an incident could not happen again, the matter is considered closed by the Russian authorities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware that the International Conventions UNCLOS and MARPOL, which inform the Sea Pollution Act 1991, covers these types of circumstances and specifically state that their provisions do not apply to warships. In the case of the Admiral Kuznetsov, as a naval vessel, the usual rules on pollution, as pertaining to commercial vessels, do not apply.</P>

	<P>In January of this year, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan TD, issued a work programme for the development of a national climate policy. In accordance with this work programme, he will issue the Heads of a Climate Bill, by the end of 2012, for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht, following Government approval. I will be contributing actively to Government consideration of the draft Heads of a Climate Bill.  As I stated at the United Nations last year, climate change is already having an enormous effect on the lives and the livelihoods of some of the poorest people in the world.</P>
        <P>At the country level through our aid programme, Irish Aid, we have witnessed the effects of climate change on the ground. Through our development work, particularly in relation to our work to combat hunger, we have sought to provide assistance to help farmers and communities adapt to the changing environmental context. Through our support for pro-poor agricultural research we are assisting farmers become more productive through enhancing farm methods and improved seed varieties. We are scaling up many agricultural supports that deliver on both hunger and climate objectives, such as conservation agriculture, agro-forestry, crop diversification and the development and promotion of drought resistant crop and livestock varieties.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid will continue strengthening its engagement on environment and climate change issues to safeguard the progress made to date in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and to protect the world&rsquo;s poorest communities from the increasing impacts of adverse weather events and growing environmental challenges.  In this regard I would note that my Department has excellent cooperation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which is the Department with lead responsibility in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change response. In the context of the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, I am determined that this will continue in the future.</P>

Human Rights Council in Geneva in May; the extent of his dialogue with both Morocco and France in trying to support the principle of self-determination for the people of Western Sahara; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2nd Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Morocco took place on 22 May 2012.  Under the UPR process, each UN member state is subjected to a thorough review of its human rights record by the UN Human Rights Council approximately every four years. Ireland participates actively in the process, and submits questions and recommendations where appropriate to States undergoing review.  In the course of the review of Morocco, Ireland raised its concerns about the human rights abuses in Western Sahara in particular reports of arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of human rights defenders. Ireland recommended that independent and impartial inquiries should be carried out with respect to allegations of mistreatment in detention, and also recommended the inclusion of a broader human rights monitoring mechanism in the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peace-keeping mission in Western Sahara.</P>
        <P>Morocco accepted Ireland&rsquo;s first recommendation with respect to inquiries into allegations of mistreatment in detention but rejected the recommendation of including a human rights monitoring mechanism in the mandate of MINURSO. The formal adoption of the report of Morocco&rsquo;s review is expected to take place during the 21st   Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2012.</P>
        <P>I regard the UPR process as an invaluable tool in raising standards and increasing awareness of human rights. While I regret that Morocco is not yet willing to accept the inclusion of a human rights monitoring mechanism in the mandate of MINURSO, I believe that its engagement with Human Rights Council special procedures is indicative of a greater willingness to engage with the international community on issues of mutual concern and also points to the gradual process of reform generally underway within the country which is to be welcomed and should be encouraged.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the most effective solution to the human rights issues arising in Western Sahara lies in a political resolution. Ireland continues to fully support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, and the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination. Regular contact is maintained by my Department with both the Moroccan Embassy and with the Polisario Representative in Ireland as regards developments in the Western Sahara while the issue is also regularly discussed with EU Partners in the relevant Council instances in Brussels. The EU also maintains an active dialogue with Morocco on political and human rights issues, including the Western Sahara.</P>
        <P>While there had not been any breakthrough in a series of negotiations held earlier this year, I was encouraged that the two parties were engaging in dialogue with each other.  The two sides were due to meet again in June and July for informal negotiations.  I regret that these talks have not gone ahead as it is only through dialogue and engagement that the two sides will reach a political solution. I would encourage both parties to renew its engagement with the informal negotiations under the mandate of the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Personal Envoy, Christopher Ross.</P>

	<P>I have discussed this case with the Secretary of State on a number of occasions, most recently last week when we reviewed a number of issues. I have been assured that the process which has led to the prisoner&rsquo;s detention fully adhered to the law and that advice was sought from an independent body to verify that this action was pursued in a correct manner. The NIO has confirmed that a Royal Prerogative of Mercy was given to the prisoner on 30 April 1980 but that this pardon was only granted in respect of a sentence of twenty years for conspiracy to cause an explosion and was not granted in relation to the sentence of two terms of life imprisonment related to the Old Bailey bombing. On 22 February this contention was upheld by the Parole Commission which ruled that the prisoner is subject to life license in respect to the two life sentences.   I understand that the prisoner&rsquo;s legal representatives are currently exploring the further legal avenues available to the prisoner to appeal this decision.</P>
        <P>I have also raised concerns surrounding the health of the prisoner with the relevant authorities.  The prisoner has been moved to the medical wing of Hydebank Prison and more recently to hospital for medical treatment. My officials are in regular contact with the authorities in Northern Ireland, relevant MLAs, human rights NGOs and others closely following this case. I will continue to raise my concern as appropriate with the relevant authorities.</P>

        <P>A Moneylender&rsquo;s licence granted by the Central Bank is specific to that moneylender, in that each individual moneylender&rsquo;s licence outlines the specific products that the moneylender offers, the APR for each product and the total cost of credit for each product.  Before applying for a moneylender&rsquo;s licence, an applicant must give notice of this intention in a local or national newspaper, published in Ireland and circulating in the District Court area that the applicant intends to engage in the business of moneylending.  The Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender&rsquo;s licence if, in the opinion of the Bank, the cost of the credit to be charged is excessive or, if any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.  This decision may be appealed to the Circuit Court.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 67 to 69, inclusive, and 71 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Central Bank that amounts up to the value of IR&pound;1,000 can be exchanged for euro on the same day subject to checking by the Central Bank for authenticity of the IR&pound; bank notes. Amounts in excess of IR&pound;1,000 will be accepted by the Central Bank, however value in euro will not be provided in exchange on the same day.  A receipt will be issued pending verification/authentication of the bank notes.  Payment is processed electronically into the bank account of the lodging party for the appropriate amount. Where bank account details are not provided, a cheque may be issued for the value of the redeemed notes.</P>
        <P>Persons exchanging amounts in excess of IR&pound;1,000 are required to complete an exchange form.  With effect from 01 July 2012, all lodgments irrespective of value must be accompanied by an identification document.  All bank notes are checked for authenticity prior to exchange.  The Central Bank informs An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of lodgments or attempted lodgments where the Bank knows or has sufficient reasons to believe that a criminal offence has been or is being committed.</P>
        <P>The details of exchanges below IR&pound;1,000 are not captured in an automated system. The details relating to the value of cash received are amalgamated into bulk figures on a daily basis for accounting purposes. Records of individual transactions are not maintained.  Transactions in excess of IR&pound;1,000 are not exchanged for cash but are paid into a bank account or by cheque.  The Central Bank retains a list of individual transactions including amount, payment date and name of payee.  For these reasons it is not possible to provide an individual transaction breakdown as requested by the Deputy. However, I have asked the Central Bank to provide details of individual transactions over IR&pound;1,000 for a number of days since 1 January 2011 which show the highest levels of daily transactions. I will write to the Deputy further on this.</P>
        <P>I also understand from the Central Bank that the exchange process is currently under review and that this review will be finalised prior to year end. An objective of the review is to reduce the threshold for cash payments significantly from the current level of IR&pound;1,000. This will lead to a much higher proportion being paid electronically with full audit trail.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about investigations carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no general investigation initiated by them into the practice of the exchange of Irish Punts into Euro at the Central Bank. I am informed that Revenue&rsquo;s audit and investigation activity is largely driven by risk analysis assessment of the potential tax or duty loss arising from any given activity.</P>
        <P>Procedures put in place by the Central Bank limit the amounts of currency that can be immediately converted by any individual. Amounts in excess of that limit are normally lodged to the individual&rsquo;s bank account. In addition, as noted earlier in my reply, the Central Bank has recently introduced more stringent identification criteria for individuals lodging IR&pound; for conversion to Euro.  Revenue has robust inspection powers in relation to the investigation of an individual&rsquo;s bank account when it has reason to suspect that tax evasion is taking place. In this context I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s risk analysis approach will adequately address any potential for tax evasion arising from these currency exchanges.</P>
        <P>I am awaiting information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding investigations carried out by them. I will write to the Deputy when I have this information. The Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit of the Department of Justice and Equality has no function in this area.</P>

	<P>With regard to the VAT treatment of below cost selling, VAT is a tax on the value added to a supply, and the collection and recovery of VAT takes place at each stage of the chain of supply from manufacturing to retailer.  Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.</P>

	<P>The Government announced the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund in September 2011. The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. Marketing of this fund in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital commenced in the first quarter of 2012. Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year. In parallel, AMP Capital, the infrastructure manager of the fund, has commenced a process of building a pipeline of appropriate investment opportunities.</P>
        <P>The NPRF has also committed &euro;450 million to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters subject to certain conditions.  In addition, the NPRF is actively supporting the development of the market for venture capital in Ireland through its continued participation in Innovation Fund Ireland in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  On 15 March 2012, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation announced the commencement of the second call for expressions of interest from appropriately qualified international venture capital managers.</P>
        <P>Further involvement of the NPRF in the SIF is expected to require the amendment of the investment policy of the NPRF, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Central Bank that the Bank will assist the Irish Payments Services Organisation (IPSO) in the development of terms of reference for the review and will consider the outcomes in conjunction with IPSO. Both the Central Bank and IPSO agree that they should be open and transparent with the findings where it is practical to do so e.g. the anonymity of member institutions will have to be protected.   In relation to the review of the IT failure in Ulster Bank, the Central Bank will be working in conjunction with the Financial Services Authority in the UK, which is the lead regulator for the Royal Bank of Scotland group, of which Ulster Bank is a  corporate member. The decision to make  public the findings of that review will be a matter for the UK Authority.</P>

        <Quest> the Revenue that would have been raised if the corporation tax rate had been 17.5% for each of the past five years; if he will give an estimate of the revenue that would be raised if a temporary levy of 5% were to be added to the current corporate tax rate of 12.5% as a measure to address the current economic situation for a period of five years after which time the rate would return to 12.5%; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, I and other members of the Government have repeatedly expressed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the retention of the 12.5% rate. In that context, I see no point in undertaking the hypothetical exercise suggested by the Deputy.  It is possible to provide an estimate on a straight line basis assuming that the proposed levy would apply to the same taxable income of all companies to which the current standard rate of corporation tax rate applies. However in reality it is impossible to estimate the level of additional tax revenue that would be realised due to behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a measure which would be a significant factor given the scale of the increase suggested in the question.</P>
        <P>Estimating the size of the behavioural effects of a change of this nature is difficult but it would be significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average. In other words, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%. This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. In ranking taxes by their impact on economic growth, corporate tax was found to be most harmful. In other words, governments seeking additional tax revenues would be advised to consider increasing all other types of tax (property, consumption and income) before increasing corporate taxes.</P>
        <P>The very major importance to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax in the current climate must also be borne in mind. Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries. It would be difficult to justify a temporary levy in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s consistently strong view that it will not change its corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 to 83, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>I am advised by NAMA that a list of all tenders run by it and the results of the tenders are available on its website, <i>www.nama.ie</i>.  NAMA operates three legal panels from which it procures services as and when required:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Legal Due Diligence Panel (Issue date: 31st of July 2009)</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Enforcement and Refinancing Panel (Issue date: 31st March 2010)</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Corporate Legal Services Panel (Issue date: 22nd September 2011)</P>
        <P FLI="0">The list of firms on each panel is available at <i>www.nama.ie/procurement/</i>.</P>
        <P>It is not clear as to which Panel the Deputy is referring.  On the presumption that the questions relate to the Legal Due Diligence Panel, NAMA advises that:</P>
        <P>The appointment by the NTMA of the 64 legal firms to that legal panel was carried out in advance of the establishment of NAMA.  It was made in contemplation of due diligence work which would be carried out by NAMA in respect of the acquisition of relevant bank assets from institutions participating in the NAMA scheme.  At that time, the NTMA did not have a clear view of the resources that would be required to fulfil that task.  Accordingly, it made clear that the making of any such appointment would not necessarily mean that a successful appointee would subsequently be engaged.  This was specified in clause 3.1 of that agreement.</P>
        <P>As it transpired, the vast bulk of loans (and corresponding debt exposures) acquired by NAMA were highly concentrated in a relatively small number of debtors whose secured lending arrangements were both complex and expansive.  NAMA formed the view that it required the assistance of certain specialist firms on its panel who, in NAMA&rsquo;s view, had the resources, expertise and experience to deal with those arrangements.  That is not to say, however, that NAMA only relied on such firms in the due diligence process.  As the process progressed, NAMA engaged firms of all sizes and representing a geographic spread. However, it should be noted that over 90% of the property collateral securing NAMA loans was based in a small number of counties: Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth.</P>
        <P>While NAMA was aware of having the resources of the entire appointed panel at its disposal, it did not actually need to engage all on that panel for a variety of reasons. Amongst these, NAMA engaged a number of solicitors to work with it directly, in-house, in carrying out the legal due diligence function, which brought significant efficiencies and acquired knowledge within the Agency.  NAMA also, in conjunction with the participating institutions, refined the due diligence process to enable NAMA to limit the legal resources it required.</P>
        <P>The work for which this panel was formed is now substantially complete and those on the Panel will be notified of its termination in due course.</P>
        <P>In relation to due diligence work carried out for NAMA from its inception to end-March 2012, please be advised of the following fees paid, which formed part of a response to a previous parliamentary question on the matter:</P>
        <P><i>Due Diligence Costs </i></P>
<P><i>Due diligence costs are costs that NAMA has incurred upon acquiring the portfolio of loans from the Participating Institutions. The Loan valuation model used by NAMA to acquire the loans makes an allowance for due diligence costs as a reduction from the acquisition value of the loans and as a result NAMA recovers the majority of its due diligence costs from the Financial Institutions</i>.</P>
        <P><i>a) Legal due diligence (from inception to March 31st, 2012)</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>Legal due diligence costs are recovered from the Financial Institutions through a reduction in the acquisition value.</i></P>

        <Quest> if there is a system of targeted spending from revenue collected in respect of each of the following taxes (details supplied); if so, if he will provide a breakdown of same in respect of each of these tax revenues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking all revenues of the State, including tax revenues are paid into the Central Fund. They are not assigned to specific areas of expenditure but rather form part of the pot from which overall Exchequer expenditure is funded.  However, it is the case that receipts from both the Household Charge and Motor Tax are directed to the Local Government Fund, rather than the Central Fund.</P>
        <P>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the Revised Book of Estimates (REV) for 2012 in February. The REV sets out the voted expenditure allocations for every Government Department and Office.</P>
        <P>A breakdown of expenditure from the Local Government Fund is shown on page 114 of the 2012 REV. It should be noted that &euro;46.5 million of the estimated proceeds from the <i>Budget 2012</i> increases in Motor Tax in 2012 are due to be paid over to the Central Fund from the Local Government Fund this year.</P>
        <P>Similarly, receipts from PRSI are allocated to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the National Training Fund (NTF), rather than the Central Fund. The bulk of receipts go to the SIF. Spending from the SIF is directed to benefit schemes. A complete breakdown of expenditure from the SIF can be found in the 2012 Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Social Protection. It should be noted that as the income of the SIF is presently insufficient to cover all of its expenditures, a subvention is required from the Exchequer to meet the shortfall. Expenditure under the NTF supports training and the identification of skills needs. A breakdown of NTF expenditure can be found on page 133 of the 2012 REV. It should be noted note that the estimated income from contributions on the NTF in 2012 has been revised to &euro;300.8 million.</P>
        <P>Both PAYE and Universal Social Charge (USC) receipts form part of income tax and are paid into the Central Fund. They are therefore available, along with other sources of tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts as well as the funds sourced from borrowing, to fund overall Exchequer expenditure.</P>

	<P>Under the regime of flexible options on retirement first introduced in 1999, the options to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash (after payment of the &ldquo;tax-free&rdquo; lump sum and subject to tax, as appropriate) are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has either a guaranteed level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised or, alternatively, (if the individual does not wish to purchase an annuity) that he or she place a maximum set-aside amount or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the &ldquo;tax-free&rdquo; lump sum, if less, into an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF).  Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) at the time the option is exercised, bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present. Equally, the maximum set aside amount for investment into an AMRF was changed from a fixed level of &euro;63,500 to a variable amount equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &mdash; &euro;119,800 at present. These changes were made in the context of the extension of the flexible (ARF) options on retirement to all main scheme benefits from Defined Contribution pension arrangements. These and related changes were signalled in the National Pensions Framework document published in March 2010.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF, or the cash option mentioned above, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed income in their own right throughout their retirement. A further change introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 is that the specified income test can be met at any time after retirement and before age 75 and not just at the point of retirement as was the case previously.</P>
        <P>To qualify as &ldquo;specified income&rdquo;, the pension or pensions&rsquo; income must actually be in payment &mdash; pensions anticipated at some time in the future cannot be brought into the reckoning until they commence to be paid. As the specified income requirement is essentially a personalised test, only guaranteed pensions income paid to the individual in his or her own right can be taken into account. Pensions paid directly to the spouse of an individual or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to adjust the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit at this time. However, I have received a number of representations about the scale and timing of the increase in the limit introduced in Finance Act 2011 and I will examine these matters again without prejudice in the context of next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.</P>

	<P>The joint industry Government ICT Action Plan published earlier this year establishes a target of doubling the annual output of lecel 8 ICT graduates to 2,000 by 2018. In recognition of the fact that it will take time for recent increases in demand for STEM programmes to convert into increased graduate it also provides for a number of measures to increase the supply of domestic skills in the short term.  750 level 8 places have already been made available this year on intensive graduate skills conversions programmes with industry placements. Graduates will be available in early 2013. In addition, 530 people with ICT qualifications at level 8/9 have just graduated from the first phase of Springboard 2011. A further 2,200 places on ICT programmes from certificate to masters degree level were also announced at the end of May as part of the second phase of Springboard and details are available at <i>www.springboardcourses.ie</i>.  The selection of providers to deliver the ICT conversion programmes and the new round of Springboard programmes was determined following open competitive tendering processes which were open to all public, private and not for profit education and training providers.</P>
        <P>In relation to other levels of provision, FIT is funded annually by F&Aacute;S in accordance with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations. Funding for 2012 was approved by the F&Aacute;S Board at &ldquo;up to &euro;950,000&rdquo;.  FIT does not directly deliver training. It recruits trainees who receive tailor-made curricula, suitable for these learners, delivered by F&Aacute;S or the VECs.</P>

	<P>This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. There are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant.</P>

	<P>A clear four stage process and criteria for designation as Technological University was published in February of this year. Institutions proposing to merge and apply for designation as technological universities, including those in the South-East will need to submit a formal expression of interest within a six month period and will be advised within a further six months whether they can proceed to the second stage for designation. The drafting of legislative proposals to provide for the amalgamation of Institutes of Technology and the establishment of Technological universities will be advanced in tandem with the designation process as part of the work which is underway on implementing the higher education strategy.</P>

	<P>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Staffing Circular 0007/2012 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The staffing circular also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are also contained in the staffing circular 0007/2012.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy appealed their allocation of mainstream teaching posts for the 2012-2013 school year. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board considered the case at its meeting on 18th and 19th April 2012 and refused the appeal. The Board of Management of the school has been notified accordingly.</P>
        <P>The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will appreciate, that in view of the financial constraints imposed by the need, as outlined in the Five Year Plan, to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school accommodation to meet demographic demand, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a project for the school in question will be progressed.</P>

	<P>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (Vote 25) has overall responsibility for Local Government funding. This includes responsibility for Dormant Accounts funding, which facilitates, inter alia, the grant aiding of schemes relating to educational and social disadvantage.  The Vote of my Department (Vote 26) facilitates Dormant Accounts funding concerning the tackling of educational disadvantage. The principle underpinning Dormant Accounts funding is that it is Exchequer neutral. Such funding disbursed from my Department&rsquo;s Vote is accordingly offset by receipts from the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The NTMA is responsible for managing the Dormant Accounts Fund and pays over receipts to an appropriations in aid subhead in my Department&rsquo;s Vote, making the expenditure net neutral. In 2011 and to the end of June 2012 Dormant Accounts funding totalling &euro;1.67 million was paid out by my Department. The funding was made up of: &euro;1.160 million to support Institute of Technology Access Programmes; &euro;0.484m Limerick DEIS (Delivering Equality of opportunity In Schools) schools (current funding)  &euro;0.014m Limerick DEIS schools (capital funding); &euro;0.012m in respect of pre-school initiatives.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL) is a reference tool developed by the Council of Europe to assess the achievement of learners of foreign languages.  While programmes of education and training provided by the universities and Institutes of Technology lead to awards which are aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), those awards have not been systematically referenced to the CEFRL.</P>
        <P>The proper alignment of language courses and awards to the CEFRL is a complex process as there is no natural comparison between national qualifications frameworks and language reference tools like CEFRL, and this needs to be considered in formulating a principled approach.  It should also be borne in mind that the CEFRL has been designed based on research into European languages and therefore is not automatically applicable to all languages.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the body responsible for the NFQ, has undertaken some work in transposing the NFQ and the CEFRL and it is intended to progress this further following the establishment of the new Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI).</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s international education strategy encourages education institutions to promote outward mobility of staff and students as part of their own institutional internationalisation strategies.</P>
        <P>Many education institutions already provide opportunities for some of their students to spend a period of time studying overseas, including in partner institutions in some of the BRIC countries.  These institutional initiatives supplement the significant opportunities provided by the European Union&rsquo;s Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 which, each year, allows thousands of Irish students to study for a period in another European country.</P>
        <P>At national level, the Farmleigh Fellowship, which has received substantial support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise Ireland, is providing Irish graduates with experience of doing international business in Asia and will build a critical mass of professionals who will spearhead a greater business, political and cultural engagement between Ireland and the region.  The Fellowship was established in 2009 by a group of Singapore based Irish business people following the 2009 Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh House.  The programme provides an opportunity for up to 25 Irish graduates each year to work with Irish and multinational companies in Asia while pursuing a joint MSc from UCC and Nanyang Business School in Singapore.</P>

	<P>I accept the desirability of promoting work and study placements in European countries in order to acquire expertise, including linguistic competency.  Considerable numbers of Irish students are currently studying or working abroad.</P>
        <P>National targets are a feature of the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) of the European Union, which is designed to promote educational mobility in the European Union for study and work-placement.  The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013 (LLP) comprises a range of programmes supporting cross-border mobility, networking and sharing of best practice.  With an overall budget of nearly &euro;7 billion for 2007 to 2013, the Lifelong Learning Programme enables individuals at all stages of their lives to pursue learning opportunities across Europe.  Ireland receives some &euro;10m annually from the LLP.  The Programme will end in 2013.  A new programme will be introduced in 2014, to run until 2020.  Under the proposals of the European Commission for the new programme, the number of participants is expected to double.</P>

	<P>I am currently leading the reform of the Junior Cycle.  A Framework for the revised Junior Cycle has been prepared.  It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience during their junior cycle.  These 24 statements will provide the basis for school planning and evaluation.  They will involve not only the combination of curriculum components (subjects and short courses) but also other key skills across all areas of learning.</P>
        <P>The six key skills of Junior Cycle are &lsquo;Managing Myself, Staying Well, Communicating, Being Creative, Working with Others, Managing Information and Thinking&rsquo;.  These key skills very much concentrate on soft skills and competences.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the Teaching Council, which has statutory responsibility for the review and accreditation of programmes of initial teacher education, published criteria and guidelines for initial teacher education providers in 2011.  These will form part of a consultation process.  They form a bridge between the Council&rsquo;s policy and the development and implementation of reconceptualised programmes of initial teacher education in Higher Education Institutions, providing clarity for HEIs to enable them to ensure that their programmes meet the Council&rsquo;s accreditation requirements.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy for Higher Education places a strong emphasis on the value of generic skills for the preparation of Irish graduates for the workplace and for their role as citizens.  Skills identified by the ongoing OECD AHELO project due to report in March 2013 that should be incorporated into undergraduate education include analytic reasoning; critical thinking; written communication; leadership and team working skills.  The Strategy recommends that higher education institutions explicitly address generic skills in their provision.  Implementation of the Strategy is under way and is being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The implementation plan and progress reports are available on <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s policy, detailed in the Government&rsquo;s National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, is that pupils will learn two languages, English and Irish in primary schools.  The Strategy is being implemented since its publication in July of last year.  There are no plans in the current budgetary situation to extend the range of languages available as part of the curriculum in post-primary schools but substantial changes will occur in the teaching of languages as a result of the curriculum changes that will take place as part of the reform of the Junior Cycle.  The languages English, Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian will continue to be offered as part of the curriculum at junior cycle.  At senior cycle, the languages English, Irish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic will continue to be offered.  The availability of Transition Year and the option of school developed short courses proposed as part of junior cycle reform will provide opportunities for schools to provide additional languages, if they wish to do so.  A number of developments are also ongoing which should help to ensure that there is greater coherence to language teaching including foreign language teaching.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is developing an integrated language curriculum for primary schools in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  While the focus of this curriculum will be on English and Irish, it should help children to transfer skills acquired in one language to other languages and so establish a sound foundation for the learning of a foreign language in post-primary school.  As part of junior cycle reform, it is expected that the syllabuses for the foreign languages currently available will be revised and that students will reach proficiency in one of these languages.  At senior cycle, the syllabuses for French, Spanish, German and Italian have been reviewed within a common framework and are expected to be finalised during the 2012/2013 school year following a process of consultation with relevant parties.</P>
        <P>Apart from curricular languages, studied and examined in the Leaving Certificate examination, as noted above, the State Examinations Commission provides examinations in a range of non-curricular languages.  These are languages which do not appear as part of the normal school curriculum but students may opt to be examined in these languages under certain conditions.  The conditions, for the candidates in the Leaving Certificate examinations, include:</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />they must be from a member state of the EU</P>
<P><Miles com="bull66" />they must speak the language in which they opt to be examined as a mother tongue</P>

	<P>Students at third level currently have access to a wide range of foreign language courses that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines.  Information on all language courses, including those relevant to emerging markets, is available on the Qualifax website <i>www.qualifax.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In addition, almost 150 new part time higher education places on foreign language courses have been made available under Springboard 2012.</P>
        <P>The issue of the supply of foreign language skills was also addressed in a report published by Forf&aacute;s and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs last month.  The recommendations in this report, Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally, will provide a valuable input to considerations around the further development of foreign language provision in third level institutions.</P>

	<P>The NCSE has notified all schools of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year of resource hours for low incidence special needs.  The arrangements for how schools access these resource hours in teaching posts are set out in the Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  Under these arrangements a network of over 2,500 full-time resource posts has been put in place in close to 1,700 base schools throughout the country.  The list of these schools and the criteria used to select them is set out in the published circular.</P>
        <P>These resource posts are allocated on a permanent basis and the teachers in them will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools.  Schools that are unable to access these hours will be allocated mainly temporary part-time posts.  It is also open to schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, to make an application for a full-time temporary resource post.</P>
        <P>The school referred to has been allocated 85.85 resource (low incidence) hours by the NCSE and is the base school for 2 resource posts.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs published the Heads of the Children First Bill on the 24th April last.  I fully support this Bill, the purpose of which is to put Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>Last autumn, my Department published updated Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools based on the updated Children First 2011.  These along with the Department&rsquo;s vetting requirements already address, on a non-statutory basis, the requirements and obligations arising from Children First 2011 and they apply to all primary and post-primary schools, irrespective of size.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, following its publication, the Heads of Bill was sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consultation with key stakeholders to take place before the Bill is finalised.  My Department is also liaising on an ongoing basis with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the how the proposed legislation will impact on the schools system and to ensure, as far as possible, that its implementation at school level will complement the updated child protection procedures in place within the education sector.</P>

	<P>Changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme.</P>
        <P>The main change to the current scheme means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest Post-Primary Education Centre having regard, as heretofore, to ethos and language.</P>
        <P>In general, existing eligible and catchment boundary children including those who are not attending their nearest post primary centre will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.</P>
        <P>Siblings of these children and other children who are not attending their nearest school may apply for school transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce computer science into the second level curriculum in view of the recent international surveys showing a weakness in the Irish educational system in mathematics and closely related subjects like computer science; if the informal computer science initiative for young persons being taken by a Minister in his Department will be extended into mainstream curricula; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment.  This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum.  Therefore, it is not time bound.</P>
        <P>The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.  To further support teachers in using ICT in the curriculum, the NCCA developed the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Teachers as a supporting document to the Primary School Curriculum 1999.  The guidelines were launched by the Department of Education and Science (DES) in 2004.</P>
        <P>I am currently leading the reform of the Junior Cycle.  A Framework for the revised Junior Cycle has been prepared.  It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience.  One of the Statements of Learning aims to ensure that all students &ldquo;use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The reform will allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration.  This will provide a new opportunity for schools to progress the provision of short courses to enhance students&rsquo; ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning.  Such courses could include software programming and coding, if a school so chooses.  One of my Minister of State&rsquo;s has established a CoderDojo programme in his constituency.  The content of such a programme, for example, could be considered by schools to form part of a new short course.</P>
        <P>In addition ICT will be an area of essential learning which all students will be required to experience, and Managing Information and Thinking will be embedded in subjects as a core skill.   There is also a Transition Year option in relation to Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games and, under the ICT Action Plan, this is being expanded nationally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>Teachers in all schools are paid on an incremental salary scale.</P>
        <P>All teachers employed before 1 February 2012  receive an allowance appropriate to their qualifications.</P>
        <P>Principals are paid an allowance in respect of the duties attached to this post.</P>
        <P>In addition there are other allowances which may be paid to teachers depending on the type or category of schools in which they are employed. An example is a teacher teaching in a Gaelscoil who may be paid an allowance for teaching through the medium of Irish.</P>
        <P>The details of the incremental salary scale, qualification allowances, principal allowances and other allowances and their values are outlined in the following Circulars.</P>
<P><i>New Pay Scales for New Appointees to Teaching in 2011 Introduction</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">1. The Minister for Education and Skills wishes to inform vocational education committees, management bodies and teachers of the application of revised rates of salary and allowances for new appointees to teaching from 1 January 2011 onwards.</P>
        <P FLI="0">2. As part of Budget 2011 the Government has applied a 10% reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service (referred to in this Circular as &ldquo;new appointees&rdquo;) and all new appointees to the entry grades of the public service must start at the first point of the relevant pay scale with effect from 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Application of new pay rates</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">3. The 10% reduction in pay applies to basic pay, allowances and the supervision and substitution payment.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>(a) Basic Pay:</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">The 10% reduction applies to basic pay on all points of the incremental salary scale. Daily and hourly rates for casual and non-casual teachers in the primary sector and hourly rates for casual and non-casual parttime teachers in the post-primary sector have also been reduced. The revised rates are set out in an Appendix to this Circular and can be accessed by clicking here.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>(b) Allowances:</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">The 10% reduction also applies to all allowances with the exception of promotional allowances; <i>ie </i>special duties, assistant principal, deputy principal and principal allowances.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>New Appointee to teaching</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">4. The new pay rates apply to all teachers who are new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0">5. Where a person gave service in an analogous teaching position before 1 January 2011 (including those currently on an approved leave of absence), s/he will not be regarded as a new appointee to teaching. In addition, a person with a written offer of employment before 1 January 2011 will not be regarded as a new appointee. In these cases, the person will be assigned to the appropriate pre-1 January 2011 scale and allowances, and incremental credit for approved teaching service and non-teaching experience which is deemed relevant will be awardable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">6. Where a teacher who is retired and is in receipt of a pension returns to teaching on or after 1 January 2011, s/he will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Incremental credit</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">7. All new appointees to teaching will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale. The Government has decided that all new appointees to entry grades (subject to the criteria set out above) will start at the minimum point of the new reduced scale.</P>
        <P FLI="0">8. However, incremental credit may continue to apply for relevant recognised service (<i>e.g. </i>recognised teaching service in another EU Member State). Similarly, those who leave the system will be able to reckon such previous relevant service on re-entry.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>Circulation</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">9. Please ensure that copies of this Circular are provided to the Board of Management/Vocational Education Committee and its contents are brought to the attention of all teachers in your employment including those on leave of absence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">10. This Circular can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website under <i>http://www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P FLI="0">11. All enquiries regarding this Circular should be e-mailed to <i>teachersna@education.gov.ie</i> OR <i>payroll@education.gov.ie</i></P>

        <P FLI="0"><i>I am a newly qualified teacher who has never worked as a substitute teacher &mdash; Which pay scale will I start on?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">Only service given in a teaching position pre-1 January 2011 will count as prior service for eligibility for pre-2011 pay scales. If you have not served in a teaching position (including as a substitute) before 1 January 2011 you will be offered a contract at the new pay rates and conditions. You cannot receive incremental credit for any training prior to entry to teaching.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I am a teacher who worked in Ireland as a substitute teacher in 2001 but I have been in the UK for the past number of years &mdash; Which pay scale will I start on?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You worked in a teaching position prior to 1 January 2011. You will therefore be offered a contract at pre-2011 pay rates and conditions. Your service as a qualified and registered teacher in the UK will be reckonable for incremental credit purposes.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I am a teacher who worked in the EU for the past number of years. I have never worked in a teaching position in the public service in Ireland but am due to start in May 2011 &mdash; Which pay scale will I start on?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You are a new appointee to teaching. You will begin on the first point of the January 2011 payscale. Recognised teaching service in another country prior to your first entry to teaching in Ireland is reckonable subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I am a qualified and registered teacher who has prior public sector experience as a Lecturer. I will begin teaching in May 2011 &mdash; Which pay scale will I start on?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You are a new appointee to teaching. You will therefore be offered a contract at January 2011 pay rates and conditions. This applies also to teachers who are moving to take up a post in other positions (<i>eg </i>Special Needs Assistants, administrators, etc). You may be entitled to certain incremental credit in respect of your lecturing service.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I have been employed as a teacher in the private sector for 5 years. I will begin teaching in the public sector in May 2011 &mdash; What will my starting salary be?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You are a new appointee under the recent Government Decision. You will therefore be offered a contract at the first point of the January 2011 pay rates and conditions. You may be entitled to incremental credit subject to certain conditions.</P>

        <P LI="1">1. The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform Vocational Education Committees, Management Authorities and Teachers of the application of revised rates of salary and allowances with effect from 1 January, 2010.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. The new rates of salary and allowances have been introduced as a result of the application in the education sector of pay reductions with effect from 1st January 2010 in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 (No. 41 of 2009) (The &ldquo;Act&rdquo;).</P>
        <P LI="1">3. In accordance with the Act, reductions in basic salary have been applied with effect from 1st January 2010 as follows:-</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />5% on the first &euro;30,000 of salary;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />7.5% on the next &euro;40,000 of salary</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />10% on the next &euro;55,000 of salary.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />This formula produces overall reductions in salaries ranging from 5% to 8% in the case of salaries up to &euro;125,000.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Fixed allowances payable to persons whose basic pay does not exceed &euro;125,000 p.a. have been reduced by 5%.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. The adjustments apply to basic pay and allowances (including revised daily and hourly rates for casual and non-casual teachers in the primary sector and revised hourly rates for casual and non-casual part-time teachers in the post-primary sector) and are set out in a schedule to this Circular which can be accessed on this Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> under Education Personnel/Payroll.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. Vocational Education Committees and Management Authorities are requested to bring the contents of this Circular and the schedule to the attention of teachers in their schools and to the members of the Board of Management.</P>

        <P>PTC is responsible for the recruitment of students onto the programmes and students pay course fees directly to that company, not to WIT.</P>
        <P>I further understand that on behalf of the students WIT has sought to obtain clarity from PTC on the arrangements it intends to put in place to ensure  students can complete their study and has also asked PTC for an undertaking that, in the event that it fails to resume the course in full, it is in a  position to refund all fees paid by the students to the Company.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if he will provide an update on the proposed reforms of public procurement to support Irish firms and to allow greater access by Irish small and medium enterprises to public contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35704/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of SMEs in the award of public contracts.  The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />less use of &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; tendering procedures and greater use of &ldquo;open&rdquo; tendering;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The National Procurement Service (NPS) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission.  For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000.  The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. On average 5000 tenders for the procurement of goods, services and works are advertised on eTenders every year.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the NPS that the latest information for above-EU threshold contracts is for 2010.  In that year, the State spent &euro;3.3billion on above threshold contracts of which only 8.7% went to non-domestic companies.</P>
        <P>In terms of overall procurement budget (approximately &euro;14 billion in 2010), the NPS estimates that approximately 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers.</P>
        <P>The development of policy in relation to public procurement has to be seen in the context of a set of rules agreed by European Member States which have the aim of creating a transparent and competitive single market for public procurement contracts.  It is a basic principle of EU law that between citizens and businesses within the Union there should not be discrimination on grounds of nationality.  Therefore it would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</P>
        <P>The importance of procurement policy becomes apparent when one sees that each year public authorities across the European Union spend 18% of GDP or approximately &euro;2.3 trillion on goods, services and works.  In this context, it is important to realise that the open market regime offers critical opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad.  In this regard, Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade Ireland offer training and support to businesses in order to raise awareness of public procurement opportunities and to improve the capacity of indigenous firms to compete effectively for these opportunities</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his plans to issue social procurement provisions and guidelines to Irish public bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The rules on awarding public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement for employment of long term unemployed, as a condition in the performance of the contract.  Any such provision must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.  Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I understand that the National Procurement Service is currently looking at developing guidance for contracting authorities in relation to the use of such social clauses.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is currently considering funding applications totalling &euro;1.3m received from Cork County Council on the 4th July, 2012, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme, to address recent flooding in Clonakilty, Glanmire and Douglas.  In relation to Clonakilty in West Cork, the amount of funding applied for is &euro;1.2m.  The applications are being assessed in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management. </P>
        <P>In addition, Clonakilty is as an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) under the South West Catchment  Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study and the application will be considered having regard to this study.</P>

        <P>Over the past decade many of the economy&rsquo;s key infrastructural deficits were addressed through a large capital investment of over &euro;60 billion in infrastructure through Exchequer capital expenditure.  In recent years, it has been necessary to prioritise public spending and scale back the public capital programme in order to bring the public finances under control.</P>
        <P>In November of last year, I published &ldquo;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo; which outlined the five year Exchequer Capital Framework out to 2016.  This Framework was published following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme led by my Department.  The Framework sets out a significant tranche of Exchequer investment over the next five years, and is designed to address critical infrastructure deficits, aid economic growth and provide much needed social infrastructure.  It will be complemented by the investment plans I announced yesterday which will be largely predicated on using non-Exchequer sources of funding to support the first Phase of a new PPP Programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure. </P>

        <P>In 2012, just under &euro;4 billion has been provided for the Exchequer capital programme.  At the end of June 2012 capital expenditure by Departments was just over 7% behind profile.  This is not unusual as variances can often rise to 10 or 12% at this time of year. Based on information supplied by Departments, I expect most areas to be on profile at year end.</P>

	<P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my announcement of February 22 last in which I outlined the shape and scale of the asset disposal programme that is to be pursued.</P>
        <P>In brief, the programme that was agreed by Government in February consists of:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s energy business (but not including BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s gas transmission or distribution systems or the two gas interconnectors, which will remain in State ownership); and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The sale of some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Consideration is also being given to the sale of some assets of Coillte, but not Coillte&rsquo;s land holdings; and the sale of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus, when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price to Government.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made on this programme since I made that announcement: a request for proposals issued recently in regard to the procurement of advisers for the BGE Energy transaction; the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has prepared a package of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation assets to be brought to market and this has been endorsed by Government; In the case of Coillte, the Government has determined that a concession for the harvesting rights will be proposed for sale.  Nevertheless, I do not envisaged that any of these transactions will be underway before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Ryanair has made a formal bid for Aer Lingus and I am advised that, under the takeover rules of the Irish Takeover Panel, Aer Lingus is now in &ldquo;offer period&rdquo;. I do not, therefore, propose to comment further on Aer Lingus at this time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, and 140 together. </P>
        <P>As a result of the <i>Talk Talk</i> closure in Waterford in September last, I launched the South East Employment Action Plan, which contains targeted actions to address the specific unemployment problems affecting the South East region.  This Plan was published in late 2011.</P>
        <P>I met with all the agencies, local authorities, CEBs, education institutions and other local representative groups from the South East at the end of last year.  That meeting of the new South East Forum, to drive the implementation of this Action Plan was the first time that a group of that nature had met collectively with the focus solely on what can be done to improve the region&rsquo;s fortunes.  I organized a second meeting of this group last month in Waterford, where we reviewed progress to drive the implementation of the Plan.  It was agreed that a series of further specific actions would be developed by the relevant bodies.  I intend convening another meeting of the Forum later this year.</P>
        <P>In fact, I am pleased to say that there has been significant progress in developing employment in the South East region in the last 6 months.  Following my direction to assign a clear priority to the region, IDA company site visits there in the first six months of 2012 were greater than the total for 2010 and 2011, which is a very positive indicator of future progress in attracting Foreign Direct Investment to the area.</P>
        <P>IDA has been very active in seeking to win additional investment for Waterford.  That Agency&rsquo;s overseas offices continue to target and engage with relevant companies to highlight the attractiveness of the <i>Talk Talk</i> facility as a potential opportunity for a Greenfield investment or as an expansion opportunity.  IDA has developed a prospectus on the Waterford facility particularly focusing on the workforce skills sets and the facility&rsquo;s suitability as a modern call centre.  This has been circulated to IDA&rsquo;s international network of offices.</P>
        <P>In February 2012, the first phase of the &euro;23m Belview Strategic Water Supply Scheme was officially opened.  This scheme will facilitate industrial development and job creation in Waterford and the wider region.  The total investment for this phase of the scheme is &euro;13m, of which a significant amount was provided by IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>With regard to Enterprise Ireland (EI), there have also been a number of positive developments, including bbetween 2011 and 2012 (to date) EI has approved almost &euro;17 million to support a range of in-company and other enterprise related activities in the South East region and Eight High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) were approved in the South East region in 2011 &mdash; the highest ever figure in the region.  Funding totalled &euro;1.6 million.</P>
        <P>Significant announcements by EI in the South East region recently include the following: The <i>Eishtec </i>Call Centre has expanded significantly and now employs 230 staff, well ahead of their planned development.  In June 2012, <i>Dawn Meats</i> announced that it had won a five year contract with <i>McDonald&rsquo;s Ireland</i>.  The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &euro;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&rsquo;s Cross, Co Waterford, creating 65 new jobs.  In addition, over 100 construction jobs have been created during the construction phase of the facility, which commenced in December 2011.  In June 2012,<b> </b><i>Danone Baby Nutrition</i> announced an investment of &euro;20 million in its Wexford manufacturing plant, to meet growing demand for its products across the European market.  This investment will create approximately 45 new jobs.  <i>Eirgen</i> a Waterford based drugs Manufacturer announced in June 2012 that it will create 30 new jobs.  The South East Competitive Feasibility Fund, launched in January 2012, is a &euro;200,000 fund.  Over 40 applications were received with 14 high quality projects approved.  Each start-up will receive individual one-to-one mentoring with the South East Business Innovation Centres.  Further EI supports will be considered as each feasibility project evolves.  In June 2012 the Pilot Innovation Graduate programme was launched in conjunction with Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT).  EI clients in the region will employ graduates for 18 months to work on innovation projects in companies which are designed to enhance the innovation performance and capability in those companies.  The graduate will receive a postgraduate diploma (level 9).  It is intended that the Pilot, placing 15 graduates, will commence shortly.  EI&rsquo;s Potential Exporters Division was launched to prepare Irish companies to develop their exports.  Workshops are being organised throughout the country, with one having been held in Waterford in May last, with 49 companies participating.</P>
        <P>The FUSE Initiative is a two year initiative that was started by Enterprise Ireland but is run and driven by entrepreneurs from throughout the Southeast region.  The intention is that it will ignite business growth in the region by harnessing the energy and skills of all entrepreneurs through their participation in a variety of projects that are all focused on job creation and business growth.  To date it has over 200 members, many very significant employers from the region.  Further Enterprise Ireland Initiatives include five Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for a full-time Business Development Manager and, separately, there has been a high take-up of the EI Innovation Voucher Scheme in Waterford.</P>
        <P>On a wider theme, there is a need to develop &lsquo;new&rsquo; sectors in the Region and to upgrade the skills base in general.  The enterprise development agencies will adopt a &lsquo;spotlight on Waterford and the South East Region&rsquo; to the end of 2012, implementing such actions as; Continuing to focus on the sustainability and growth opportunities through intense engagement with client companies in the South East Region.  Building on the potential in the Cleantech &amp; Lifesciences sectors for the Region.  Continuing to pursue opportunities for Waterford in the areas of Cloud computing, e-games, international and financial services, e-commerce and other content businesses, building in particular on the evaluation and research strengths in the Region.</P>
        <P>In relation to assistance for micro-enterprises, Waterford County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector in the Waterford region.  The CEBs support the sector in the start-up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support the CEBs are central in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing their growth potential and, in developing into strong export entities where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.  For the first six months of this year, it is very encouraging to note that Waterford City and Waterford County CEBs have, between them, supported the creation of a total of 58.5 new jobs.  Waterford IT and Carlow IT formally launched their New Frontiers programmes on April 12th .  Recruitment is well underway with a high level of interest.  The programme is aimed at emerging entrepreneurs and is funded and has been developed by Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that Science Foundation Ireland has funded 8 research awards to Waterford IT valued at &euro;308,000.</P>
        <P>In relation to export data, this is not broken down by region, so it is not possible to provide specific trade figures for County Waterford for the years in question.</P>
        <P>We must accept that the reality is that the structural challenges that the South East region faces have built up over many years and will not be reversed with a simple set of actions.  What is required is to build a stronger enterprise base in the region as a whole.  There are challenges for all agencies in the region to help build up the region&rsquo;s competitive advantage and then to promote it in a coordinated manner.</P>

        <P>With regard to subsistence, I am interpreting the Deputy&rsquo;s question as relating to subsistence paid by my Department to Ministers and Ministers of State from the 1 January 2007 up to 9 March 2011; details of subsistence paid in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is also seeking indications of the portion of the subsistence that are both vouched and unvouched for each year.  Hotel costs and subsistence costs are aggregated on my Department&rsquo;s Financial Management System and it is not feasible, therefore, to identify separately the vouched/unvouched aspects of the subsistence paid since 2007.</P>
        <P>The original payment method, whether by cash or credit card, is not captured by my Department&rsquo;s Financial Management System as it is not material to the reimbursement of subsistence expenses incurred and borne in the first place by the individual.</P>

	<P>The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers. Many young people will benefit from the opportunities provided through these programmes. </P>
        <P>The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 measures to be delivered across all 15 Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  My Department and its agencies play a central role in the delivery of approximately 60% of those measures, and have a supporting role in many other actions.</P>
        <P>Pathways to Work includes various training, education and work experience initiatives delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors.  These places will include provision for school leavers, although the long-term unemployed are a priority target.</P>
        <P>The new &euro;20 million Labour Market Education and Training Fund will also include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.</P>
        <P>Both the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work are national programmes.  However, they will have an impact at regional level.  This year to date, the IDA has announced the creation of over 5,000 new positions, with Limerick, Galway, Cork, Dublin, Sligo, Dundalk, Kildare and Mayo all benefitting from job announcements.  Enterprise Ireland has also made job announcements in relation to companies in Waterford, Wexford, Tipperary, Dublin and Galway.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the concerns raised in the correspondence to the Deputy that transferring responsibility for the payment of employees&rsquo; sick pay to employers will add to the cost of doing business.  I have received similar views from a number of business organisations and individuals on the matter.  </P>
        <P>The Government is concerned about the extent of dependence on State-funded sickness benefit schemes and we need to examine ways in which to reduce this dependence.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who has policy responsibility for the sick pay scheme, held a consultative meeting earlier this year to discuss potential changes to the scheme in Ireland.  However, no decision has yet been taken on the matter.</P>
        <P>Proposals for a statutory sick pay scheme would impact on competitiveness and employment.  The evidence of this impact will need to be weighed against the potential for savings in terms of reduced absence due to sickness.  I will therefore carefully scrutinise any proposals which develop from this consultation phase and their impact on jobs and competitiveness, and I will contribute fully to the Budgetary process within Government.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, along with my Government colleagues, I am actively addressing a number of specific cost issues affecting business &mdash; and particularly small businesses &mdash; through the Action Plan for Jobs.  These include reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, and encouraging professional service providers to supply price quotations in advance of providing services.  I have also been examining the potential for Government Departments and agencies to reduce or freeze their charges to business.  A number of Departments and agencies have agreed to reduce or freeze a range of charges arising from this exercise.</P>

	<P>Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and is a key focus of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs.  In March 2012, Enterprise Ireland (EI) established the Potential Exporters Division, as one of the key measure in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place.</P>
        <P>From Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, exporting companies need to continuously assess and develop their capabilities in a broad range of areas including inter-cultural communications and Cultural Awareness including language skills with priorities in German, French, Spanish, Mandarin and Russian.</P>
        <P>The lack of foreign language skills among some Irish companies can be an inhibitor to their ability to secure and grow new customer opportunities, and deepen business opportunities with existing customers, suppliers, partners and key buying influencers in non-English speaking markets.</P>
        <P>The <i>Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally</i> Report published by Forf&aacute;s and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) on 22 June 2012, highlighted that Ireland&rsquo;s SME base lags behind the rest of Europe in terms of their awareness of the need for foreign language skills to accelerate international growth opportunities and that, over recent years, the supply of graduates with foreign language skills has diminished.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland was closely involved in the assessment of the future skills needs in this area and the above Report&rsquo;s preparation through its membership of the steering group and arranging the participation on the Group of a number of its client companies.  Enterprise Ireland strongly supports the recommendations of the Report in relation to the development of strategic marketing capability amongst its SME client companies and the call for Ireland to further strengthen our multi-lingual workforce.</P>
        <P>Against this background, Enterprise Ireland continuously witnesses the positive impact on credibility and sustained export growth for those Irish companies that have invested in bringing the language skills into the company or developing them within.</P>
        <P>One of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s current initiatives is the <i>Graduates 4 International Growth Programme (G4IG)</i>, which is focused on matching graduates with Irish companies seeking to develop in international markets.  <i>G4IG</i> supports companies through the recruitment, assessment and training of graduates in International Business.</P>
        <P>Graduates are recruited on an 18 month contract of which 6 months is spent in Ireland undergoing academic and on the job training followed by 12 months in an overseas market.  Graduates participating on this Programme have, through their overseas placements, the opportunity to enhance and strengthen their language and inter-cultural skills to the benefit of the sponsor companies as well as improve their own capabilities.</P>
        <P><i>G4IG</i> will remain the primary focus for EI in this regard, and is meeting the demand from Irish companies currently for this support (128 graduates were placed in the first two phases of programme).  Phase Three of the Programme is currently under way with a target of 80 graduates to be placed in Irish companies from September 2012 onwards.</P>

	<P>All claims for Maternity Benefit received after the 6 month time period  provided for under Section 241(2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, are considered late claims. Provision is made under legislation to allow payment of a late claim where there is good cause.</P>
        <P>A Maternity Benefit claim form (MB10) was received from the person concerned  on 13th February 2012 in respect of her daughter, born on 5th July 2011. When a claim is received outside the permitted 6 month period the claimant must have &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; for the delay in making her claim.</P>
        <P>Initially, the claimant  did not provide the Department with any reason which is considered &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; and her claim was disallowed.</P>
        <P>The claimant  appealed this decision and has cited current financial hardship and illness as reasons why the Department should accept her late claim. Provisions are in place to accept a late claim for the reasons of financial hardship or incapacitation provided the Department is satisfied that such is the case. Unfortunately, she did not provide sufficient evidence which would support her claim.</P>
        <P>A Department official was in direct contact with the claimant  by telephone on 11th July and has explained to her what supporting documentation would be required by  my Department so that her claim can be reviewed.  Upon receipt of the documentation to support her claim for financial hardship and incapacitation the persons claim will reviewed immediately.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 20th September 2011.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 16th   March and the case has been referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate with regard to employment retention and costs to business.</P>
        <P>In relation to the possible introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, a range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the matter. These include the extent of coverage; the duration of payment; the rate of payment; compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate; and how to ensure that a scheme of statutory sick pay would be enforced and policed.</P>
        <P>The impact of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme would be contingent on how all of these issues are addressed and how such a scheme would ultimately be structured but a preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism in the private sector indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add about &euro;1 per week per employee to the costs of employment.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that all of the issues around statutory sick pay will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of Budget 2013 and any decisions which might be taken by Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme will be  considered in that context.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to establishing a new National Employment and Entitlements Service as part of its drive to implement more efficient and effective delivery of services to unemployed people and others.

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Young people who are unemployed, once they have been on the Live Register for three months, are referred to the employment service of my Department for a guidance interview and additional support under a case management approach. This is designed to identify and address specific difficulties the young person faces in securing employment (e.g. by referral to appropriate training or other supports).</P>
        <P>The Department is currently moving to profiling of newly unemployed people when they enter the Live Register, as a basis for immediate referral of those most needing assistance. This should allow young people facing particular difficulties to be directed to appropriate supports earlier in a spell of unemployment than was possible heretofore.</P>
        <P>More generally, young people leaving education with Leaving Certificate or higher qualifications who face difficulty in finding work can register with the employment service for assistance with job search. In these cases, access to training and other labour market programmes is not made available for a period (4-6 months) after leaving education. This is to ensure that labour market programmes are not seen to encourage exit from education.</P>
        <P>Where early school leavers (under 18 years and with no Leaving Certificate) seek to register with the employment service, the emphasis is on encouraging such young people to stay on at school and complete the Leaving Certificate.  Where this is established not to be possible (based on written evidence from their school or parents that they have officially left school or by referral by the Educational Welfare Board), they are considered eligible to register with the employment service.  Due to their lack of/or low qualifications, they may be referred, without a four-month waiting period, to suitable training programmes, such as Community Training Centres or Youthreach, which are specifically designed for early school leavers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The current differentiation in the treatment of a spouse/partner&rsquo;s income from employment and self-employment for the purposes of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance has existed for many years, as has the non-eligibility of the self-employed for family income supplement. I note the concerns put forward by the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondent in this regard. However, any changes to the current arrangements would need to be considered from the broader policy perspective and in a Budgetary context. </P>
        <P>I also note that the person involved states that his income from self-employment in the current year has declined.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the relevant legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse/partner may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. The legislation also provides that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months shall be assessed.</P>
        <P>However, account may also be taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next. This could arise, as would appear to have now happened in the case in question, where a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a similar substitute contract in the coming year. In this regard, it is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels should be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.</P>
        <P>If this is the situation in this instance, the spouse/partner of the self-employed person should contact  the relevant local office of this Department and request a review of entitlement based on changed circumstances. In addition it is open to the individual, if they are dissatisfied with the means assessed, to appeal any such decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together. </P>
        <P>The pay of individual employees can vary from week to week, with the result that over the course of a year employers&rsquo; PRSI in respect of any individual employee may be paid at the higher rate in some weeks and at the lower rate in other weeks. In any given week, employers&rsquo; PRSI is paid at the lower rate in respect of approximately one third of employees and at the higher rate in respect of two thirds of employees.</P>
        <P>The total yield from each of these categories is not separately identified by the Revenue Commissioners, who collect the great bulk of PRSI on behalf of the Department. However, it is estimated that at present  96% of the total employers&rsquo; PRSI yield is derived from employments in respect of which the higher rate is payable, with the remaining 4% being derived from employments in respect of which the lower rate is payable. As the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI was halved with effect from 1st   July 2011, the proportion derived from employments in respect of which the lower rate was payable was somewhat higher in 2009, 2010 and to a lesser extent in 2011.</P>
        <P>For completeness, the number of persons in Social Insurance Class A in 2009 and 2010 is tabulated below, broken down by gender. The total income of the Social Insurance Fund was &euro;7,298 m. in 2009, &euro;6,710m. in 2010 and  &euro;7,543m. in 2011.</P>

The person was notified of this outcome by letter dated 25 February 2012.   A reply to previous questions, 353 and 358, on 12 June 2012 incorrectly stated the appeal had been disallowed rather than partially allowed, as the person was seeking an assessment of 20%.   The Social Welfare Appeals Office wish to apologise for this confusion.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the sustainability issues regarding pensions in Ireland and the pension reform measures underway to try to address some of these issues including the raising of State pension age which has already been provided for in primary legislation. </P>
        <P>Currently, the State pension (transition) is available to those who fulfil the qualifying criteria and the normal rules continue to apply for those transferring over from another social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>As part of the pension reform measures underway, this will change in 2014.  While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 2014.  Thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</P>
        <P>In relation to pension reform, as Irish society has changed, pensions policy has evolved to reflect these changes.  A key focus of mine has been to ensure that the State pension is sustainable in light of demographic changes and the associated increases in pension costs.  This challenge is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances.  Our primary consideration in making the changes we have made to reform pensions has been to ensure that pensions are adequate and the system is on a financially sound and sustainable footing.</P>
        <P>For those with an income need social welfare schemes will continue to be available, for those who fulfil the eligibility criteria.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that a forum to consider the retirement and longer working considerations which may result from the changes to State pension age is currently being scheduled by my Department.  The purpose of this forum is to enable the representatives of the various government departments, social partners and other interest groups to engage and consider the issues involved.</P>
        <P>We will always continue to provide the normal supports to those who can&rsquo;t, for whatever reason, continue working or find themselves in financial difficulty.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that a letter of appeal was received in that office on 6 June 2012.

        <Quest> if regulations will be issued to ensure that rent supplement applicants will be issued both a deposit and a months advance rent by their community welfare officer if the applicant&rsquo;s landlord demands same and will not otherwise allow an applicant to take up the tenancy; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that unless a CWO will assist applicants in this way that many are being driven into the hands of exploitative moneylenders; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35731/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012. </P>
        <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, such as a payment of a rent deposit, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.</P>
        <P>   There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment and each application is determined by the person administering the scheme based on the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need.  Such payments are confined to occurrences which the person administering the scheme considers to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional.</P>
        <P>Multiple rent deposits are not generally paid to the same person and every effort is made to ensure that only one payment is made.  If the landlord or tenant terminates the tenancy, the tenant can use the returned deposit to secure a new tenancy.</P>
        <P>Payment of rent supplement in advance may be made at the discretion of the Department&rsquo;s representative in exceptional circumstances based on the individual needs of the customer. This flexibility ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme. Accordingly, it is not proposed to issue further instructions to officers administering rent supplement.</P>

        <Quest> if she maintains that rent assistance is provided to 40% of households that rent, when the evidence from Census 2011 is that there are 475,000 households that rent in the State of which approximately 315,000 are shown as privately rented, which would indicate the 98,603 households the Minister says claim rent assistance comprise 31% of the rented market; and if it is the case that it is 31%, is the Minister concerned that cutting support by an average of 13% in one year to just 31% of households in the rented market will lead to hardship for that part of the rented market as a result of a sudden and significant reduction in purchasing power, compared with the majority of the market which competes for the same properties; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of &euro;436 million for 2012.</P>
        <P>The most up to date market data available at the time of the December 2011 review indicated that rent supplement tenancies constituted 40% of the overall private residential rented market. The initial results on housing in Ireland were published by the Central Statistics Office in its summary report &ldquo;This is Ireland, Highlights from Census 2011 Part 1&rdquo;.  The Department is awaiting the publication of the Central Statistics Office report on housing in Ireland in August 2012 which will explore this issue in greater depth.  The summary report indicates that while the percentage levels of rent supplement tenants may have reduced, it is clear that the Department continues to fund a significant proportion of the private sector rented market. It is therefore essential that State supports for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</P>
        <P>The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>25,000 rent supplement claims, which represents over 27% of total claims, have been awarded this year indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the revised limits.</P>
        <P>The Department is continuing to monitor the impact of the rent limits.</P>

	<P>The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009. The &euro;100 rate does not apply certain categories of claimant including:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />claimants with a qualified child;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />those making a claim for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />those transferring directly to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance from Disability Allowance;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</P>
        <P>Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.   While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Deputy has been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  Officials of the Department met with Focus Ireland in May 2012 in relation to their concerns. These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</P>
        <P>More generally, it may be noted that the Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp; New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that, where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</P>

	<P>My Department is establishing a new National Employment and Entitlements Service, as provided for in the Programme for Government, which will integrate employment and benefit payment services within the Department.  This is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy.  I would like to stress that the Pathways to Work policy is not a policy working in isolation from other actions.  The Government launched its Action Plan for Jobs with a view to creating a net additional 100,000 jobs over the next five years.  Pathways to Work is a complementary policy designed to support people currently on the live register to access those jobs.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of NEES offices has always been envisaged as a multi-annual programme of change within my Department in relation to how to how the Department provides its services.

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s principal objectives as regards our shared national heritage are to:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />promote the role which Ireland&rsquo;s heritage has to play in making Ireland an attractive destination for sustainable tourism and inward investment, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />provide for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage in accordance with best practice and legal requirements both nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department, in delivering the continued protection, conservation and enhancement of our shared national heritage, does so within a multi-stranded framework and set of mechanisms based on various legislative provisions.  Central to this task is the continued engagement by my Department, relevant agencies and local authorities with communities and the active assistance of the owners of our national heritage assets.  This is a core activity of the Heritage Council in particular.</P>
        <P>My Department provides some limited funding under a number of headings for investment in the built and natural heritage, and also supports the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust in their work in the heritage area.  My Department is focused on working creatively across Government and with partner bodies, such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the EU-funded Rural Development Programme (formerly LEADER) and other heritage interests, in seeking to ensure that resources are directed towards the heritage sector.</P>
        <P>As Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am seeking to develop a number of initiatives which can contribute to the protection and appropriate re-use of our built heritage and the on-going challenges facing our architectural heritage, such as the adaptive re-use for historic properties and a forward plan-led approach to cultural heritage and urban design in our towns and cities.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department is currently engaged in developing a specific heritage-led Historic Towns Initiative in collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Heritage Council.  My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns have access to and an understanding of appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.  I expect that the initiative, once fully developed by the end of 2012, will be piloted in at least three towns in 2013.  The initiative is informed by the experience of related interventions in other Member States for example under the EU INHERIT (2005-2007) and HerO (2008-2011) programmes.</P>
        <P>Ireland, represented by my Department and the Heritage Council, is also an active participant in the EU Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global Change (JPICH) &mdash; specifically through the vehicle of the Joint Heritage European Programme (JHEP).  Funding from this programme is partly used to provide a full-time project manager at the Heritage Council, dealing directly with the heritage organisations of 25 EU Member States and other JPI Associated Countries.  Thus, Ireland is directly involved in shaping the priorities and agenda for heritage-related research in Europe, contributing to the formation of a Strategic Research Agenda for Cultural Heritage in all participating States.  Participation in the JPICH is an important step in establishing Ireland as a key player in European-level collaborative projects relating to Cultural Heritage and in establishing an effective network of European heritage partners.</P>
        <P>Finally, my Department regularly engages in the EU LIFE+ programme, in association with other Departments, agencies and NGOs, for the purpose of protecting and restoring our natural heritage, in particular habitats and species.  LIFE funding requires that projects have a substantial awareness raising component.  Current projects in which my Department is involved as funder and/or participant include removal of invasive non-native plant species from Lough Corrib and the canals; and restoration and improvement works on the Mulkear River.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Government, I am developing a national commemorative programme for the period from 1912 to 1922.  Although centred on the Easter Rising, the commemorative programme will seek to reflect all the political, economic, social and cultural issues of this historic decade.  The significance of the First World War for Ireland, Britain and the British Empire, Europe and the wider world will be appropriately reflected in the commemorative programme.</P>
        <P>The current programme of annual commemorative events relating to World War I will be complemented by special commemorative initiatives in each of the centenary years from 2014 to 2018.  Alongside these formal commemorations organised by national and local authorities, I would hope that there will be many other events taking place in memory of particular actions, units and anniversaries.</P>
        <P>The experiences of the Irish soldiers in the war will be examined and their service and achievements acknowledged.  The transformative effects of the war on society will also be examined.  I anticipate that the impressions of the First World War as recorded in literature and the visual arts will also form part of any commemorative endeavour.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>Government policy on the arts is set out in the Programme for Government.  In the context of the 2012 Estimates, I continued my endeavours to maximise ongoing Government support for the arts and culture sector.  For 2012, the Exchequer allocation to the Arts Council, which is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts, is &euro;63.241 million.  I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and my Department has no role to play in its executive or funding decisions.  Within the current economic constraints, our investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever due to the employment intensity of the sector.  The arts are a significant economic contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.  The arts underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, in the creation of an imaginative labour force, in establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive and in cultural tourism.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to &ldquo;work with stakeholders in the Arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the Arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities&rdquo;.  It may interest the Deputy to know that in May, I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations.  The initiative &mdash; the Philanthropy Leverage Initiative &mdash; is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources.  The initiative, established with funding of &euro;230,000 for 2012, will be managed by my Department and will provide an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  It will be available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms.  Funding under this initiative will be available to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects.  Organisations will have to procure matching funds and complete their drawdown in 2012.  Matched funding cannot come from public funds or from any public sector organisation.  Funding will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis until the overall ceiling of &euro;230,000 has been reached.  Further details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.ahg.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Leverage Initiative will run in parallel with a second initiative &mdash; the Philanthropy Capacity Building Initiative &mdash; which is operated by the Arts Council.  Under this initiative, the Arts Council will provide one-to-one professional advice and direct funding support to a number of selected organisations to help them build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving.  This initiative will be delivered over two years and will be conditional on performance. In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for organisations to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy, and to properly resource that fundraising function.  This is vital if organisations are to be supported by the State in diversifying their funding base.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>In implementing and applying measures for the protection of our natural environment, I am very much aware of Ireland&rsquo;s economic needs. In accordance with the principles of sustainable development and our EU legal obligations, my aim is to ensure that parameters are set by which economic development can take place, whilst safeguarding those ecological resources, which underpin thousands of existing and potential jobs in a number of sectors.  The 2008 report &mdash; <i>The Economic and Social Aspects of Biodiversity &mdash; Benefits and Costs of Biodiversity in Ireland</i>  &mdash; considered a number of key sectors, including agriculture, forestry, infrastructure development, and climate change.  The report established a marginal value of biodiversity to Ireland of at least &euro;2.6 billion per annum, with the true value likely to be much higher if other areas such as the benefits to human health are taken into consideration.  Ireland&rsquo;s ecological capital is fundamental to the agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism sectors and is vital for sustaining societal services such as clean water, productive soil and clean air.  Rather than seeing ecological protection as a burden which impedes economic growth, it should be looked at as a prerequisite to maintaining and growing key economic sectors.</P>
        <P>The foundation of much of the legislation to protect our natural environment is found in EU Law.  Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment, Strategic Environmental Assessment, Nitrates, Shellfish Waters, Water Framework and Environmental Liability, to name a few, all play their part in ensuring that the benefits that we derive from our ecological resources, and sometimes undervalue or fail to recognise, are considered and safeguarded in our decision making processes.  As Minister, I have particular responsibilities for the implementation of the Birds Directive and Habitats Directive in Ireland.  Under these Directives, all EU Member States have agreed to contribute to the conservation of the EU&rsquo;s most threatened birds, natural habitats and species.  This includes a requirement to designate and protect Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for birds and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) for endangered habitats and species.  An area corresponding to approximately 14% of the land area of the State has been put forward for designation as SACs or SPAs.  For EU 27, the figure is approximately 18%.</P>
        <P>All Member States have similar obligations under these Directives and must operate within the same parameters of EU law.  It is, therefore, unlikely that adherence to the requirements of the Directives will result in competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other Member States.  There are mechanisms within the framework of the Directives for derogations to general protective provisions to be applied, where necessary, if certain conditions can be met.  In this context, it is possible to take economic considerations into account.  Ireland has also designated a further number of sites under the Wildlife Acts as Natural Heritage Areas.  While the protection of these sites is largely governed through national legislation, the requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive also have implications in their conservation and management.  It is not unusual among Member States to protect some sites under national legislation, and others as SACs or SPAs under EU law.  I am not aware of any evidence that such designations are the source of economic or competitive disadvantage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>Some 53 raised bog special areas of conservation (SACs) have been designated for reasons of environmental protection under the EU Habitats Directive and 75 raised bog natural heritage areas (NHAs) have been designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts. Some 50 blanket bog SACs and 73 blanket bog NHAs have also been designated. There are two raised bog SACs and two raised bog NHAs in County Kildare.  Details of all raised bog and blanket bog SACs and NHAs, including those in County Kildare, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.npws.ie</i>.  The Government has put in place a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog SACs.  This scheme now comprises a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.  Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared.  The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.  An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Commercial turf extraction has been prohibited on raised bog SACs and NHAs for some time.  Private sector operators have received compensation for losses incurred arising from these restrictions.  My Department has also operated a voluntary bog purchase scheme since 1999 and has completed sales for over 1,000 applicants under this scheme.  In 2010, the then Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on raised bog NHAs at the end of 2013.  However, in accordance with the current Programme for Government, the situation regarding the 75 raised bog NHAs will be reviewed in conjunction with the Peatlands Council.  I anticipate that the review will be completed prior to the commencement of the cutting season in 2014.  I am advised that blanket bogs are less sensitive to the effects of turf cutting than raised bogs and a general cessation of turf cutting will not be required in these sites.  My Department will shortly undertake further survey work in Ireland&rsquo;s blanket bogs with a view to putting in place management arrangements where such activities may continue, without compromising the conservation value of the sites, and in compliance with EU legal requirements.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced a series of rationalisation measures in the Public Service Reform Plan on 17th   November 2011.  Certain of these measures that relate to National Cultural Institutions funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group are currently being advanced, as required under the Reform Plan. These include the following:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Combine Irish Museum of Modern Art, Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining separate identities;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Merge National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library, while maintaining separate identities; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Examine the issue of shared services and the board structure of both the National Library and the National Museum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy will also be aware, the priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State agencies provide that such rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, it is not possible at this stage to outline projected savings for each body to be rationalised.  However, the implications arising have been under examination within my Department with a view to identifying savings, as well as opportunities for efficiencies and more effective service delivery.  This process has involved consultations by my Department with each of the relevant institutions. In addition, I have met the Chairs of the various institutions involved in this process in order to afford them an opportunity to express their views on the actions in the Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Reform Plan.  Meetings have also taken place with a range of stakeholders and interested parties on these issues. My Department has taken into consideration the various proposals put forward by the institutions and other interests.</P>
        <P>I have sent my proposed approach on the implementation of the Government Decisions on the rationalisation of the relevant national cultural institutions to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in recent days. As this will be subject to consideration by Government, I am not in a position at this juncture to go into the matter in any detail. I was, of course, able to give the House an insight into my overall thinking on these matters during the recent Private Members&rsquo; Debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together. </P>
        <P>The matters raised by the Deputy are operational matters for Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BG&Eacute;) regulated in accordance with the safety regulatory framework established by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and I have no function in this regard.</P>
        <P>BG&Eacute; is the owner of the national gas transmission and distribution systems and is mandated with the development and maintenance of the natural gas network under the Gas Act 1976.</P>
        <P>The CER is the statutorily independent body charged with all aspects of the licensing of transmission and distribution operators.  A key legal responsibility of the CER is to promote the safety of natural gas for customers and the public generally.</P>
        <P>The CER&rsquo;s remit also includes specific responsibility for natural gas safety.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 empowered the CER to regulate from a safety perspective undertakings involved in gas transmission, distribution, storage, supply and shipping.  The CER has established a natural gas safety regulatory framework, including a system for the inspection and testing of natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines.</P>
        <P>The CER places obligations on undertakings to ensure that any safety risks associated with their operations are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.  BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s transmission and distribution operations are subjected to ongoing audit and inspection by the CER.  Additionally, BG&Eacute; reports quarterly to the CER on a comprehensive range of safety performance indicators, to verify that all operations are in compliance with the overall natural gas regulatory framework.</P>
        <P>BG&Eacute; develops, operates and maintains Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas network under a CER regulated Safety Case regime.  The CER has a comprehensive audit regime to monitor compliance with Safety Case requirements.  I understand that the CER has approved Safety Cases covering the operation and maintenance of the gas network.  BG&Eacute; manages gas network maintenance and safety programmes using procedures in accordance with the Safety Cases under the CER Gas Safety Regulatory Framework and the requirements of the Health and Safety Authority.  BG&Eacute; prepares Risk Assessments for each major gas site or installation.</P>
        <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy occurred in May 2010 as the relevant BG&Eacute; subsidiary, Bord G&aacute;is Networks (BGN), was inspecting the Curraleigh West to Midleton pipeline prior to bringing the pipeline into operation.  The gauge used in the inspection showed evidence of having been subjected to abnormally high temperatures.  I am advised that there was no evidence of an explosion and the underground pipeline was not breached.  Further testing was carried out and the line has been re-tested on a number of subsequent occasions and is operating satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>Following this incident, BGN commissioned an independent external review of procedures and, based on the review findings, made amendments to technical commissioning and purging procedures.  The national Gas Safety Committee continues to supervise ongoing BGN analysis into the technical issues involved, which the Committee has determined was not a pipeline integrity issue.</P>
        <P>In addition, BG&Eacute; also applies a Safety Management System, Technical Audit and Inspection and Training Programmes across all activities of its networks business inclusive of its own staff, business partners and contractors used for Network maintenance and safety works.</P>
        <P>Safety is BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s first priority and the company is committed to ongoing development and maintenance of the gas networks and systems to ensure safety and to deliver continuous safety improvement and performance. I have every confidence in BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s priority commitment to safety and in its safety and emergency response service.  There is never room for complacency however, and BG&Eacute; itself is engaged in a constant process of safety review and   enhancement working with CER.</P>

	<P>The general scheme of a Geothermal Energy Development Bill was published in July, 2010 along with the associated Regulatory Impact Assessment.  Both these documents are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. </P>
        <P>Geothermal energy is a new area of legislative endeavour which will create a legislative framework to facilitate the exploration for and development of geothermal energy resources.  It will provide significant support to the geothermal energy sector with considerable security of tenure for potential investors.  The Bill sets out an approach to the licensing of exploration for, and exploitation of, geothermal energy.  It is modelled on the approach taken in respect of minerals exploration and development, but also deals with a range of ancillary issues such as entry onto land.</P>
        <P>Drafting of the Bill with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is ongoing.  Many of the provisions of the Bill are based on aspects of the Minerals Development Bill, particularly in relation to exploration licensing, which I expect to bring to the House before year-end.  I would expect therefore that the Geothermal Energy Development Bill will follow to be published later this year or early next year.  The progress of the Bill will be dependent on the schedule of legislation before the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Section 230 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which came into operation on 11 March 2002, provides that a licence is required in respect of the holding of an event, or class of event, prescribed under Part 16 of the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations, 2001. These Regulations, which received the positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, include requirements such as:</P>
        <P>(a) publication of a notice of intention to apply for a licence;</P>
        <P>(b)  notification of prescribed persons or bodies;</P>
        <P>(c) form and content of an application for a licence;</P>
        <P>(d) plans, documents and information to be submitted with an application;</P>
        <P>(e) bodies to be consulted in relation to a licence;</P>
        <P>(f) enabling submissions and observations to be made within a prescribed time;</P>
        <P>(g) requiring an applicant to submit further information in respect of their application; and</P>
        <P>(h) the time within which a decision on an application must be made.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The prescribed bodies required to be consulted are: (a) the relevant Chief Superintendent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; (b) the relevant Health Board; or (c) any county council, county borough corporation, borough corporation or urban district council (other than the local authority to whom the application is made), the area of which will be affected by the event.</P>
        <P>The regulations also provide that a local authority may consult any other body, not being a prescribed body, in relation to an application where it considers it appropriate, and that the local authority may take whatever measures it considers necessary, including the convening of meetings or taking of oral submissions, to seek the views of any person in regard to the application.</P>
        <P>Section 231 provides that where an application is made in accordance with the regulations, the local authority may decide to grant the licence, grant the licence subject to such conditions as it considers appropriate or refuse the licence. Conditions subject to which a licence is granted may relate to, inter alia, the following: (i) securing the safety of persons at the place in connection with the event; (ii) the provision of adequate facilities for the health and welfare of persons at the place in connection with the event; (iii) the maintenance of public order; and (iv) the display of notices for persons attending the event as to their obligations and conduct at the event.</P>
        <P>Following events at the recent concert in the Phoenix Park, I anticipate that the relevant licensing authority, Dublin City Council, will be reviewing this event, in consultation with the promoters and other bodies as appropriate, to see what lessons should be learned and whether changes to the licensing system are necessary.  My Department will be in contact with the council in this regard.</P>

	<P>An independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation-based property tax.</P>
        <P>The Group has recently completed its work and submitted its report to me.  The approach to the report will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
        <P>The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January, 2012 to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, that person is required to declare that liability by completing the household charge declaration form and to pay the household charge by 31 March, 2012.</P>
        <P>There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge. An online system <i>www.householdcharge.ie</i> is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card. In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit or debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.</P>
        <P>A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities. In addition, all county/city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge. An Post has assisted in broadening the number of local outlets where the household charge declaration form is available and the form has been available outside the counter in the network of 1,152 local post offices.</P>

	<P>Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 dealing with social housing support, and the related Social Housing Assessment Regulations, 2011, were commenced on 1 April 2011. These provide a standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing.  </P>
        <P>A household may apply to the housing authority for the functional area&mdash;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />where it normally resides &mdash; this would include a household residing in rented accommodation, or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />where it has a local connection.</P>

        <P><Miles com="bull66" />lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period  at any time in the past;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" /> is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area;</P>

At least one of these choices must be in the functional area of the housing authority of application. Qualified households will appear on the waiting lists of each of the housing authorities in respect of which they have expressed areas of choice.</P>
        <P>A housing authority may also decide at its discretion to consider an application for social housing support from a household that does not meet these residence or local connection criteria. In such a case, the household may express areas of choice within the functional area of that authority only.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that Heads of State and Government and high level representatives, following a prolonged and difficult negotiation process, achieved an agreement at the recent Rio+20 Conference. Of course, there are areas of the outcome document &mdash; The Future We Want &mdash; where the EU would have hoped for a more ambitious outcome. Nevertheless, if implemented properly, it provides a firm basis for working with our international partners to achieve global sustainable development, including poverty eradication.</P>
        <P>The Conference secured renewed political commitment for sustainable development, and also recognised the need to promote sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration, restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges.  The Conference outcome acknowledged the important role of an inclusive green economy in achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty.  The decision taken to develop Sustainable Development Goals was also a key outcome.</P>
        <P>Fundamental changes in the way societies produce and consume goods are essential to the achievement of sustainable development. One of the most important outcomes of Rio+20 was the decision to adopt the voluntary 10 &mdash; year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production. The objective of these programmes is that all countries will promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, with developed countries taking the lead, having regard to the principles set out in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development in 1992.</P>
        <P>Ireland will play a central role in progressing the work required to deliver on the outcomes agreed at Rio during our forthcoming EU Presidency, commencing on 1 January 2013. In this capacity, Ireland will, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, guide and influence the implementation process through co-ordination and development of EU positions in various fora at EU and UN levels. Implementation of the agreement in Ireland will be carried forward in the context of the recently published Framework for Sustainable Development, Our Sustainable Future, which was Ireland&rsquo;s main national contribution to Rio+20.  The delivery of the measures outlined in Our Sustainable Future will require a collective approach involving the active participation of all key sectors and civil society generally. A High Level Inter-Departmental Group on Sustainable Development will coordinate and drive overall implementation of the Framework and will report progress to the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>I have no plans to amend the Building Control Act 2007 along the lines suggested.  To date 31 practically trained persons have been deemed eligible for inclusion on the register of architects.  Of these, 6 underwent the technical assessment process and 25 underwent the register admission examination.</P>
        <P>My Department has received extensive correspondence from practically trained architects in recent years and has responded in considerable detail to the various positions put forward.  While I and my Department will be happy to consider any further concerns that members of the Architect&rsquo;s Alliance of Ireland may wish to raise in relation to this matter, I would equally encourage members of the Alliance to pursue the routes to registration which are currently open to them with a view to joining the small but growing number of practically trained architects already on the register.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year I released for public consultation proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which will provide for:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The regulations as proposed require, among other things, that the owner of a proposed building or works must assign a competent professional to inspect and certify the proposed building or works.  The assigned person must be an Architect or a Building Surveyor named on a register maintained in line with Part 3 or Part 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or be a Chartered Engineer named on the register maintained under Section 7 of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the assigned person will inspect and certify the building or works in line with a Code of Practice which is currently being prepared and which will be published, following consultation with industry stakeholders, in advance of the implementation of the proposed regulations.</P>
        <P>The proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations will now be reviewed by my Department in the light of the submissions received during the public consultation process, which closed on 24 May 2012, with a view to having a final set of Regulations prepared and signed into law in the coming months.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 2007, among other things, provides at parts 3 and 5 respectively for the registration of persons entitled to use the title of Architect and Building Surveyor.   A variety of routes to registration as either Architect or Building Surveyor are provided for, having regard to the academic qualifications, professional attainment and practical experience of prospective candidates for registration. I understand that a number of members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) have already successfully applied for registration on the register of Architects.  Depending on their academic qualifications, professional attainments and practical experience members of CIAT may also be eligible for registration on the register of Building Surveyors.  I would encourage members of CIAT interested in signing certificates of compliance to explore and pursue the routes to registration which may be open to them having regard to their own professional background.</P>

        <Quest> the role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board in securing determination orders against landlords for retaining deposits; the role the PRTB plays in retaining deposits; if the PRTB gives support to tenants pursuing determination orders in the Courts, the future steps he intends taking on these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. Under section 12 (1)(d) of the Act a landlord is obliged to promptly refund deposits unless, and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, rent or other charges or taxes are owing or there is damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear. </P>
        <P>My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 and the incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in the review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention. In July 2011 the Government approved the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011 and I anticipate its publication in the coming days. The Programme for Government 2011 commits to the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and it is important that action in this regard is taken in the context of a strong evidence base. I have therefore asked the PRTB to commission analysis-based research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations. I understand that the PRTB has recently awarded the tender for this research and I expect that the Board will revert to me with detailed research and recommendations in Autumn 2012.</P>
        <P>The Act provides for the enforcement of determination orders, where such have not been complied with, by application to the Circuit Court by either a party to the determination order or by the Board itself. Given the discretionary nature of this power, the Board exercises it in the context of the circumstances pertaining to each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Robust arrangements are in place to deliver on the public policy imperative of preserving the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s water resources in keeping with the EU Water Framework Directive.  Local authorities have an effective role to play in this regard through the enforcement of performance standards for wastewater treatment and disposal systems set out under Part H of the Building Regulations, which work in tandem with the planning system and the water quality and waste management codes to provide comprehensive protection of water quality.</P>
        <P>The design and installation of wastewater treatment systems for single houses is addressed in the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Code of Practice in respect of Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses (2009).  On foot of a comprehensive review and public consultation, Part H (Drainage and Wastewater Disposal) of the Building Regulations and its accompanying Technical Guidance Document H (TGD H 2010) were amended in the latter half of 2010 to reflect the relevant parts of the EPA&rsquo;s Code of Practice.</P>
        <P>In relation to the use of septic tanks in particular, TGD H 2010 states that &ldquo;Septic Tanks must conform to I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4 including their national annexes and comply with the EPA Code of Practice &mdash; Section 7.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The national annexes were recently completed and published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, in consultation with my Department and others.  They set out clearly the performance required by septic tanks when used in Ireland, and tested in accordance with I.S. EN 12566 Parts 1 or 4.</P>
        <P>Suppliers of septic tanks must be in a position to produce certification to confirm that their product has been tested in accordance with I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4 and meets the performance requirements set out in the national annex to the standard.  Once a supplier can do this, it is not clear what further purpose a national register of certified septic tank suppliers would serve.</P>
        <P>Part H /TGD H 2010 came into full effect, following the expiration of the normal planning-related transitional arrangements, on 1 June 2012.  I am satisfied that the arrangements now in place are reasonable and appropriate and I have no plans to revisit them at this point.</P>

	<P>On 31 May, I announced that the Government had decided that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is to be wound up, taking account of its precarious financial outlook as well as the findings of the C&amp;AG&rsquo;s Special Report on the Authority.  However, it is envisaged that the Authority will remain in place for a transitional period under a new Executive Board chaired by the Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Tierney, to allow the Authority to progress elements of ongoing work and to make the necessary preparations for the migration to new arrangements to be decided by the Government.   </P>
        <P>Over the coming months, the Authority will be focusing on managing some important ongoing business that needs to be progressed to completion; in parallel with this work, the Government will finalise the appropriate arrangements for ensuring a continued, concerted focus on the Docklands regeneration initiative, with a particular emphasis on:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />maintaining and enhancing the Docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment and high-value development;</P>

        <P FLI="0">In developing appropriate &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; planning procedures, the Government&rsquo;s intention is to facilitate a seamless transition to the new arrangements and it will be taking due account of the status of the current Planning Schemes and of planning certificates issued under such Schemes, pursuant to section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 in its considerations.</P>

	<P>Details of individual Site Resolution Plans (SRPs) are maintained by the local authorities concerned and my Department does not collate information in this regard.</P>
        <P>SRPs are a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions should also take account of the best interests of residents.The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have now been completed and issues are now resolved. On a further 523 estates, plans are now in place and in many of these cases work has commenced and significant progress will be achieved over the coming months. I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he will consider establishing a strategic development zone for the north fringe of Dublin City and south fringe of Fingal County to oversee the full remediation and completion of the district as a first class new urban region for the counties concerned; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the non-statutory North Fringe Forum urgently needs SDZ management status to strengthen its coordinating and invigilation role carried out since 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Specific responsibility for the planning and delivery of the North and South Fringe development rests, respectively, with Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  Dublin City Council adopted its Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017 and Fingal County Council adopted its Fingal Development Plan 2011-2017 both of which set out statutory objectives for the development of the North and South Fringe, respectively.  </P>
        <P>A North Fringe Cross-Authority Forum established in 2004 continues to monitor progress in the implementation of the North Fringe Framework Development.  Meetings continue to be held on a cross-authority basis at which a wide range of issues relating to the planning and delivery of the North Fringe development are discussed and actions taken.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, Dublin City Council recently published a draft Local Area Plan (LAP) for Clongriffin-Belmayne (North Fringe) which is currently on public consultation until 1 August 2012.  I also understand that Fingal County Council intend to publish a draft LAP for Baldoyle-Stapolin and a draft LAP for Portmarnock South for public consultation later this year.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the ongoing cooperation within the statutory framework of the existing development plans, and the proposed local area plans, I do not believe that a strategic development zone is a necessary vehicle to deliver on areas such as the North and South Fringe.</P>

        <P>I have appointed two Special Advisers to my office.  Both were appointed in accordance with the Instructions on Ministerial Appointments for the 31st   D&aacute;il and sanctioned by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, where appropriate.  My colleague Minister of State O&rsquo;Sullivan, who, as a Minister of State who regularly attends Cabinet, may appoint a maximum of two Special Advisers, has appointed one special adviser and is currently arranging for the appointment of a second adviser.   Minister of State Mr. Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd has no special advisers appointed in my Department.  Former Minister of State Penrose appointed one special adviser during his tenure at my Department.  Former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, who served as Minister at the Department from June 2007 to January 2011 appointed four special advisers.  One of these advisers was Programme Manager for the Green Party and while his salary was paid from the Department&rsquo;s vote he was based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  During the same period no Minister of State assigned to the Department appointed any Special Advisers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 246 to 249, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Courts Service Act 1998, management and administration of the courts, which includes the provision of statistics, is a matter for the Courts Service while the allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of cases and management of lists are the responsibility of the judiciary and in particular the presidents of the courts. The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions it should be noted that judicial retirements and promotions to other courts in the latter half of 2011 and earlier this year gave rise to up to 15 vacancies on the Circuit Court and the District Court.  These vacancies, combined with absences due to illness and Tribunal work, added significantly to the already heavy workload of those courts and did give rise to added delays.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government has moved as quickly as possible to fill the vacancies and both courts now have a full complement of judges appointed.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Government, at its meeting on 17 July 2012, approved, in principle, proposals for a number of major reforms to our courts structures which will, in due course, require the holding of a Constitutional referendum. The proposed reforms would, if approved by the People in a referendum, facilitate the establishment of a new separate Family Courts structure.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised me that statistics are not maintained on the number of adjourned maintenance applications. The manner in which an application is dealt with by the court is obviously a matter for the presiding judge.  However I am assured that the Courts Service works closely with the judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service has also informed me that urgent applications are dealt with at the next court sitting.  In many Districts routine applications are dealt with at the next sitting in the area although this can vary considerably from one District to another.  I understand that the new President of the District Court, who took up her appointment on 17 July, intends to assess all backlogs and waiting times with a view to seeing how cases can be dealt with more quickly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has enquired in particular about the position in relation to maintenance applications in Dublin Circuit Family Court and the Service has informed me that such cases are dealt with as part of proceedings related to an application for divorce or judicial separation.  The normal waiting time in that court for motions related to maintenance is between two and five weeks.  The Service has also indicated that it is not aware of a high number of unheard maintenance applications.  If the Deputy wishes to contact my office with further details I will have enquiries made.  Finally, the Courts Service has provided a detailed breakdown of the waiting times for Family Law hearings at Circuit and District Court levels which is as set out in the following tables.</P>

These vacancies, combined with absences due to illness and Tribunal work, added significantly to the workload of those courts.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government moved as quickly as possible to fill the vacancies and both courts now have a full complement of judges.<b></b></P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
        <P>During the course of the examination by a working group of the UN Human Rights Council of Ireland&rsquo;s report to that Council, prepared under the Universal Periodic Review procedures of the Council, my colleague, Minister Shatter, was asked, among many other matters, about the position of Travellers in Irish society.</P>
        <P>One delegation specifically recommended that Ireland should recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority while other interventions were of a more general nature.</P>
        <P>Minister Shatter replied that serious consideration is being given to granting such recognition.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the long standing wish of some Travellers that such status be granted and that the previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority.</P>
        <P>I am aware that dialogue between staff of my Department and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place in the past on the issue, as during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.   In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisery Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of my Department, earlier this year established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.</P>
        <P>It is not for me as Minister for State to anticipate a decision of Government.  I can say that consideration remains ongoing and it is intended that the question will be before the Government for decision as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether Section 3(9) of the Firearms Act 1925, which permits the Garda authorities to take up to three months to make a decision on the renewal of a firearm certificate is unfair on the applicant who must lodge an application in renewal exactly three months before expiry of the existing certificate, which is the earliest time permitted under the Act, in order to be sure that they do not end up potentially being in possession of a firearm without a current certificate through no fault of their own, should the Garda&iacute; take the full three months as allowed by the legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35708/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the following subsections of Section 3 of the Firearms Act, 1925 as substituted by Section 43 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 provide that:</P>
        <P LI="1">(8) The holder of a firearm certificate may apply for renewal of the certificate within three months before it ceases to be in force.</P>
        <P LI="1">(9) A decision on an application for a firearm certificate or its renewal shall be given within 3 months from the date on which the applicant submitted a completed application form.</P>
        <P FLI="0">An application for renewal does not require the applicant to submit the renewal form exactly three months before expiry, but anytime within three months before it ceases to be in force. There is therefore an onus on each applicant for renewal to submit his/her renewal form in good time so that their firearm certificate renewal application is processed in good time. The legislation provides for an applicant to have his/her renewal application assessed up to three months before his/her existing certificate expires.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Garda Authorities that the first renewals of three year firearm certificates commence on 1st August 2012 and planning for this phase has been ongoing for many months. Each current holder of a firearm certificate will receive a Firearms Renewal Form (FCR) three months prior to the expiry of their current firearm certificate. The renewal form will include all relevant details and the form provides for the firearm owner to make any changes in their circumstances (for example referees, general practitioner etc) before submitting the signed form to their local Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I am informed that all of the shooting organisations and representative groups in the State have been fully briefed on the renewal processes by the Garda Firearms Policy Unit and information on the renewal requirements of each firearm owner is available on the Garda Website <i>www.garda.ie</i>.</P>

Accordingly, section 3(9) of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended, which provides that a decision on an application for a firearm certificate or its renewal shall be given within 3 months from the date on which the applicant submitted a completed application form, is the relevant provision.</P>

Given the extent of the advance notice provided to the person concerned that she was to be dispersed outside Dublin, the stated intention of RIA to transfer her to Sligo in August is a proportional action.  It has been open to this person, in conjunction with the Dun Laoghaire Refugee Project (DRP) which is sponsoring her place in a two year Social Care course in Inchicore College to begin in September, to explore the possibility of alternative similar education courses in the Sligo area in the new school year.</P>

        <P>I have formally requested the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to consider the content of the report, that it considers holding hearings on the issues raised in the report, that it obtains the views of all relevant interested parties and that it makes such report and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Government as it deems proportionate and appropriate in the public interest.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application from the person concerned for permission to remain in the State based on her relationship with an Irish person is currently being processed by them.  In this regard, on 24 May, 2012 and again on 4 July, 2012 INIS made a request to the person&rsquo;s legal representative for dated documentary evidence of this relationship.  No reply has been received to date, however, I understand that documentation was received on 16 July, 2012 from the Irish partner of the person in question and that INIS will be in touch with this person shortly about the application.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that since the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 came into effect there have been 244 investigations carried out into alleged human trafficking.  258 potential victims were identified and 15 prosecutions for human trafficking related offences were commenced. In addition, in 2009, as a result of interstate cooperation between the Romanian and Irish authorities, 3 persons were prosecuted in Romania for trafficking related offences committed in Ireland. 19 potential  victims of human trafficking who had no other permission to remain lawfully in the State were granted a period of recovery and reflection under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking.  </P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are pro-active in attempting to detect any breach of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and investigates all allegations of human trafficking with a view to identifying potential victims and perpetrators.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years strong legislative, administrative and operational measures have been put in place to combat and prevent trafficking in persons.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State&rsquo;s response to human trafficking is co-ordinated and comprehensive.  This led to the production of a National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons. In addition to the dedicated Unit in my Department there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue &mdash; the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau; the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive  and a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board. Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Director of Public Prosecutions  Office.  There are a wide range of training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-Governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.</P>
        <P>More detailed statistical information on the nature and extent of human trafficking in Ireland and information on prosecutions and convictions are available in the Annual Reports on Trafficking In Human Beings in Ireland for 2009, 2010 &amp; 2011 on the web site <i>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</i>  at the <i>What is Being Done? / Data Strategy</i> section.</P>

	<P>As I set out in my response to the Deputy on 17 July 2012 (Question No. 535), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is reviewing what happened at the concert in question.  An initial meeting was held with the concert organisers last week and it was agreed that both organisations will carry out a more in depth review regarding all aspects of the event. The fact is that the arrangements which were in place on the Saturday night did not prevent the type of behaviour which took place.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has undertaken to let me have a full report following that review and I can assure the Deputy that I am determined any lessons will be taken fully into account in future planning and risk management of such events.</P>
        <P>Insofar as arrests are concerned, I am informed that 148 incidents were reported in connection with the event in question and 33 persons were arrested.  The majority of the incidents remain under investigation.  One person has been charged with offences of assault, contrary to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 and several offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1996 and was remained in custody.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently set out my views with respect to the number of outstanding warrants at a national level and the position with respect to outstanding warrants in Meath must also be seen in this context.</P>
        <P>It is, of course, inevitable that at any given time there will be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution nationally. Unavoidably, even in the most straightforward cases there must be some lapse of time between the issue of a warrant by the court and its execution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Apart from the huge volume of warrants which are issued nationally, there can be a multiplicity of reasons why warrants can take time to execute and, in some cases, they can prove ultimately unenforceable. It is the case that many individuals can be subject to multiple warrants and a number of the subjects of the warrants are taking every step open to them to try to avoid arrest through moving from address to address and so on.</P>
        <P>While it is clearly important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take all possible action to ensure that warrants are executed as quickly as possible, it should be borne in mind that the vast majority of warrants do not relate to violent or the more serious categories of offence. In fact, most of the warrants which are recorded as unexecuted are penal warrants, which relate to the payment of fines with imprisonment arising as a consequence of failure to pay. 93% of penal warrants at a national level are associated with Road Traffic Acts, public order and theft offences.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>Subject to the caveats I mention below, and insofar as the Meath Garda Division is concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, on 13 July, 2012 PULSE recorded a total of 4,102 executable warrants, comprising of 653 bench warrants, 83 committal warrants, and 3,366 penal warrants outstanding in that Division.  I am also advised that It is not possible to provide information in relation to the number of warrants against the same defendant as this would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to compile.</P>
        <P>In relation to the figures provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I should say that I have been advised that they are operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>Of its nature, the figure for outstanding warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old warrants which has arisen over the years. Warrants will continue to show on PULSE until such time as they are recorded as being finally disposed of and, given that some of the warrants in question are outstanding for many years, I am concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of &lsquo;live&rsquo; warrants which are enforceable which are on hand.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to consider at a national level whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants that arises. I have also asked him to report to me again in six months time on the situation in relation to unexecuted warrants and indicated that if he has any recommendations in relation to legislative or administrative action open to me as Minister which would assist in this area I will, of course, consider them.</P>
        <P>While genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant, it is obviously important that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible. I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that at present there is an Inspector in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and each Division outside the DMR tasked with managing the execution of warrants, and other issues relating to them. In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually liaises with other agencies, including Government Departments, to locate individuals sought on warrant. This has resulted in the provision of addresses, other than those provided on the warrants, for many persons sought. In particular, Garda warrants personnel regularly liaise with the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service to ensure the timely exchange of relevant information regarding persons sought for the service of warrants.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process. The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has assured me that both he and his senior management team are closely monitoring the situation with a view to ensuring that warrants are executed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>There seems little doubt that the outstanding warrants figures for previous years reflected partly the situation which then obtained in relation to the use of imprisonment in cases of non-payment of fines, a practice which I think most people now regard as highly undesirable. Since the commencement of section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, a Court is now obliged to take into account the means of the person before imposing a fine. This measure combined with other provisions such as the use of community service, payment by instalment and use of attachment of earnings should, when fully operational, have very beneficial effects on the number of warrants which the Garda&iacute; are called on to enforce.</P>

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons. Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements. The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to 12 July, 2012, there were 1,204 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  I am also informed that there have been 33 prosecutions for offences contrary to Part 2 of the Act to date in 2012.  At an operational level, it is not Garda policy to provide such information on a Divisional basis or in a manner that might lead to the identification of individuals.</P>
        <P>All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.   I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</P>
        <P>The position is that section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2011 provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may prepare and publish a code of practice or approve a code of practice drawn up by any other body for the purpose of setting standards for the display, sale, supply, advertising, promotion or marketing of intoxicating liquor and such code may apply as respects a class or classes of intoxicating liquor, a class or classes of licensed premises, or a type of licence.</P>
        <P>A voluntary code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol products in mixed-trading premises was drawn up and agreed between the mixed trading sector and the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform as an alternative to section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The Code includes provisions in relation to advertising of alcohol products by mixed trading outlets.  A new body &mdash; Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland Ltd (RRAI) &mdash; was established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation of the Code. On receipt of the third Compliance Report on the RRAI Code in October last, I launched a public consultation process inviting views on the Report and, more generally, on the voluntary approach to implementing structural separation of alcohol products in such premises.</P>
        <P>Arising from the consultation process, I am not in favour of retaining the voluntary RRAI Code. The choice, therefore, lies between implementation of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 or implementation of a statutory code of practice under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011. I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for my proposals in relation to future arrangements for the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>With regard to codes of practice more generally the Report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which was published earlier this year, includes a recommendation in relation to the development of legislation and statutory codes of practice on the advertising of alcohol.  I understand that this recommendation is being considered by the Department of Health in the context of the development of an Action Plan to address the Steering Group&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The position regarding section 16 of the 2008 Act is that draft regulations to restrict certain alcohol promotions have been drawn up but have not been made to date pending agreement on a joint North/South approach to restricting such promotions. During discussions earlier this year with the Minister for Social Development in Northern Ireland, Nelson McCausland, MLA, we reached agreement on the need to develop a joint North/South approach to restricting such promotions and on the desirability of having the necessary arrangements in place by the end of this year.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce legislation to require mandatory identification for all purchases of alcohol products regardless of age or other measures he may think appropriate to address the serious problem of secondary purchasing of alcohol by adults for minors; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that section 32 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as substituted by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003)  prohibits any person from purchasing intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years, or delivering intoxicating liquor to such a person. It is not unlawful for such a person to purchase or deliver intoxicating liquor for consumption by  a person under the age of 18 years in a private residence with the explicit consent of that person&rsquo;s parent or guardian.  </P>
        <P>Furthermore, section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 provides that when granting a certificate in respect of a spirit, beer or wine off-licence, the District Court may impose a condition that a CCTV system be installed. This provision was included in the 2008 Act with a view to deterring people from loitering in the vicinity of off-licences and to combating  secondary purchasing.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that the introduction of mandatory identification would be feasible or effective in an effort to combat secondary purchasing. Framing legislation to deal with the supply of alcohol to under 18s presents a particular challenge. It must seek to accommodate cases where a parent permits supervised consumption of alcohol by a 17 year old within the family environment while, at the same time, combatting situations where alcohol is purchased by an older sibling, or some other third party, for unsupervised consumption by under-18s in public  parks or other outdoor locations.</P>
        <P>The Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which was published earlier this year, considered the issue of secondary purchasing of alcohol by adults for minors but did not make any recommendations for further legislation in this area. I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable proposal to tackle secondary purchasing.</P>

	<P>The position is that while a certain amount of server training is provided in both the on-trade and the off-trade sectors, there are no statutory training standards or training requirements for staff involved in the sale of alcohol at present. </P>
        <P>The  Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, which was published earlier this year, contains many recommendations and policy options in relation to regulating and controlling the supply of alcohol including a recommendation that the Department of Health establish standards for server training programmes in the on-trade and off-trade sectors. I understand that this recommendation will be considered as part of the development of an Action Plan for Alcohol by the Department of Health and proposals on alcohol-related issues will go to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>The Report also recommends that the participation by licensees and staff in such programmes should be a condition of the licensing process. I will consider this recommendation in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce legislation or enforce existing legislation to ensure that all alcoholic products can be traced to where they were sold following the successful trial of this procedure in areas like the Santry district of the Dublin Metropolitan Region North; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Government Alcohol Advisery Group considered the feasibility of regulations to require the labelling of alcohol containers in its 2008 Report. Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which would enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified. However, no such regulations have been made to-date for reasons outlined in the Group&rsquo;s Report.</P>
        <P>The Group noted that while the labelling of alcohol containers was an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arose under two headings.</P>
        <P>Firstly, practical difficulties would arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers were packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine. This raised the question of whether an appropriate label could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale. The Group noted that attaching such labels to containers at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors. Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such goods.</P>
        <P>Secondly, from an enforcement perspective, it was clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container would not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appeared on the container. The labelled container could have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the person in possession of it. Indeed a container might have changed hands several times before coming into possession of the underage person.</P>
        <P>The Group also noted that according to answers already given to parliamentary questions on the subject, issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container had been raised during discussions on implementation of the 2003 Act with the Office of the Attorney General. That Office had expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container and the overall effectiveness of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</P>
        <P>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the trial referred to by the Deputy. I will contact the Deputy again when the report is to hand.</P>
        <P>For the reasons set out above, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act.  I am however prepared to give serious consideration in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill to any reasonable and workable labelling proposal that would not give rise to the difficulties outlined in the 2008 Report and in that context I will examine the Garda report on the trial referred to by the Deputy when it is received.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice and Equality</askee>
        <Quest> if he will outline the law regarding the open consumption of alcohol in cities and towns and for example on public transport; his views on the level of open consumption of alcohol in streets across the country as well as on public transport and at public amenity open spaces including parks and beaches; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that local authorities have the power to make bye-laws in relation to the consumption of alcohol in public places. With regard to public transport, the Revenue Commissioners can issue a licence for the sale of alcohol in a railway restaurant car for consumption in that car. Other than that the consumption of alcohol on public transport is not permitted.</P>
        <P>Under section 37A of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as inserted by section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, where a Garda suspects that a person is under 18 years of age and that that person, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years in a place other than in a place used as a private dwelling, the Garda may seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, he or she may seize the alcohol. The Garda may also seek the name, address and age of the person suspected to be under 18 years of age. It is an offence for a person, when requested by a Garda, to refuse to give his or her name, address and age or to hand over the bottle or container, with a fine of &euro;500 on summary conviction.</P>
        <P>Moreover, section 8A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as inserted by section 19 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, provides that a member of the Garda Siochana may, in certain circumstances, seize and remove intoxicating liquor in a bottle or other container from any person regardless of age. The powers of the Gardai under this section also include power to request the person to give his or her name and to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. These powers may be exercised where the Garda believes that the person concerned is acting in a place other than a private dwelling in a manner that is causing, or is likely to cause, a nuisance or annoyance to others or is, or is likely to be a danger to persons or property or to cause a breach of the peace.  As with section 37A, failure by a person to cooperate with a request to hand over the alcohol or to give his or her name and address is an offence with a maximum fine of &euro;500. The maximum fine in the case of a failure to comply with a direction to desist from their activities or to move on is &euro;1,000.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the incidence of street violence and anti-social behaviour. There is little doubt that much of this is fuelled by excessive drinking, as well as the use of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is using the strong legal powers available under the Public Order Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to keep our streets as safe as possible, including prosecutions where appropriate. As set out above, the powers available include the seizure of alcohol to prevent under age drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Garda&iacute; may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. These are a more efficient use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.</P>
        <P>I am in regular contact with the Garda authorities about these matters and these contacts will continue.</P>
        <P>However, this problem is not simply a matter of law and order. Rather, it requires action by parents, educators and those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses, but right across the retail sector. I have indicated that, in the coming months, I intend to put in place additional regulations which will curb the level of excessive drinking.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 to 285, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>These questions relate to a recent tender competition in respect of the management of seven State owned asylum accommodation centres. The competition was carried out by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, which is charged with responsibility for accommodation of asylum seekers while their application for protection in the State is being processed. Currently, RIA accommodates over 5,000 asylum seekers in 37 centres throughout the State.  All of these centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA but in the case of seven of those centres, the subject of these questions, the land and buildings are owned by the State.</P>
        <P>Contracts were awarded in June 2012 following an EU wide tender process in respect of the seven centres. The Request for Tender (RFT) for the provision of management, catering and other services at these centres was published by RIA in late 2011.  The tender was split into 5 lots and the contracts were awarded as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">As specified in the RFT, the contracts were awarded for a period of 3 years. All contracts came into force on 15 June 2012 and are scheduled to conclude on 11 June 2015.  If all contracts run for the entire contracted period, the overall value will be approximately &euro;18 million, plus VAT.</P>
        <P>OFM Ltd falls into the category of a &lsquo;small or medium sized&rsquo; (SME) company.  In relation to the clarification sought in the &lsquo;details supplied&rsquo; with Question No. 35931/12, I am advised by RIA that Campbell Catering Limited is owned by ARAMARK Ireland Holdings Limited (AIHL). AIHL is the Irish holding company in the international ARAMARK group. ARAMARK Corporation is the holding company of the group and the ultimate holding company of Campbell Catering Limited. Campbell Catering Limited is the only company in the ARAMARK group which provides services directly to the RIA to operate State owned centres. ARAMARK Ireland is headquartered in Dublin, with regional offices in Belfast, Limerick and Cork. The company has had a presence in Ireland since 2005 when ARAMARK first invested in Campbell Catering  Limited, a well known Irish food service company which was founded in 1967.  ARAMARK reports that it has invested over &euro;60 million in its operations in Ireland since 2009 and employs over 4,000 people directly nationwide.</P>
        <P>Rules governing EU tender competitions are designed to create an integrated market across member states and the companies listed in the table above were legitimately entitled to participate in that tender competition.  Plainly, given that the services provided are in the nature of accommodation, food, heat, light etc. it is evident that much of the expenditure by the winning contractors is within the State.  How profits are to be used by any company arising from Government contracts, whether indigenous or not or whether or not they arise from services to asylum seekers or any other kind of service, is a matter for the company itself consistent with the financial laws of this State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that RIA is not an employer of any staff member working in any asylum seeker accommodation centre, even State-owned centres.  In relation to those companies who won the contracts, as shown in the table above, a condition of the RFT was that they complied with the TUPE provisions of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which deals with the safeguarding of employees&rsquo; rights in the event of transfers of undertakings etc.  This means that those employees covered by the TUPE regulations remain employed in the centres concerned although, plainly, in centres which have a new management company, management personnel will change.  To RIA&rsquo;s knowledge, no new net permanent jobs were created through the awarding of contracts following this competition.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance circular 10/10, &ldquo;Facilitating SME Participation in Public Procurement&rdquo;, which is available on <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>, sets out positive measures that contracting authorities are required to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  I am advised that RIA took steps to ensure that SMEs were not discouraged from competing in the competition.  Indeed, the majority of the tenderers responding to this RFT could be classed as SME&rsquo;s. RIA is satisfied that this competitive processes was carried out in a manner that facilitated increased participation by SME&rsquo;s and was legal, transparent, and secured optimal value for money for the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>This is an operational matter for Teagasc, the Agriculture Food and Development Authority.  Teagasc is the main education provider of further education courses for the agri-food sector and through its long-standing association with the Institutes of Technologies and the University sector it is also significantly involved in the delivery of degree-level programmes.  Teagasc&rsquo;s education courses are provided through its own network of colleges, regional education centres and in collaboration with three privately-owned colleges. In addition, Teagasc provides specialised training to the agri- food and service sectors as required and also enjoys an extensive involvement in adult education.</P>
        <P>I understand Teagasc is aiming to provide for an increased intake of 640 students at the 6 Agricultural colleges, which is an increase of 24 on last year&rsquo;s numbers.  The planned intake for 2012 represents the physical limit of the colleges. Although colleges are managing with a deficit of teachers, I understand that Teagasc has taken a number of measures; including the redeployment of advisory staff and subcontracting the delivery of specific education modules across a number of colleges and local centres to respond positively to the demand for places in the colleges.</P>
        <P>There has been a very large increase in recent years in the demand for places in Ag colleges, something which will reflect the increased positivity towards the Agri food and farming sectors generally and I welcome this. I have been in a position to provide the flexibility within the overall numbers ceilings to allow for 6 additional teachers this year.  While the question of additional resources into the future must have regard to the need to reduce public service numbers and this requires all public bodies to comply with annual ceilings on staff numbers and to reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly. The situation in Teagasc will be closely monitored.</P>

Given the significant pressures on milk quotas in the last Milk Quota year my Department is not in a position to make any further quota available for this Scheme.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Catherine Murphy</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</askee>
        <Quest> if the agri industry blueprint for developing Food Harvest 2020 will meet the requirements of the Habitats Directive, to ensure that the plan, individually or in combination with other plans or projects, will not have a significant effect on or adversely affect the integrity of any protected site under European Law; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35740/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Food Harvest 2020 is a strategy that was developed by an industry-led committee whose wide membership included representatives of the food and drink industry, state agencies, academia, farm bodies and other interested stakeholders. As a strategic policy document, it is not in the category of plan or project under the provisions of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC that would require &ldquo;appropriate assessment&rdquo; of impact on a particular site or sites.  Implementation of many of the key measures needed to achieve the growth figures set out in the report is a matter for private sector actors including industry and individual farmers, while co-ordination of the State contribution to Food Harvest 2020 is overseen by a High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), which I chair. This Committee consists of representatives from Bord Bia, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara. Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and this Department.</P>
        <P>The HLIC decided it would be appropriate that an analysis of environmental impacts should be undertaken to inform the implementation of measures by all relevant actors including those in the private sector. The committee recognised that the broad targets in the report might be achieved in a variety of ways and determined that the environmental analysis should be of various possible scenarios related to their realisation. It is felt that this type of analysis is appropriate to the high level strategic nature of the report.</P>
        <P>An independent team of consultants has been appointed to carry out the work and is due to present an interim report in the coming weeks with a final report due in October.  The analysis will substantially follow the process of strategic environmental assessment as set out in Directive 2001/42/EC. It will include the likely impacts of achieving the targets, through a number of scenarios, on:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />biodiversity,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />flora/fauna,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />water, including groundwater quality,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />soil,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />air quality,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />landscape and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />climatic factors including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The outcome of this analysis will be important in informing future more detailed plans, programmes and projects related to achievement of the broad targets in Food Harvest 2020, including whether appropriate assessment is required of any such proposals under the Habitats Directive.  The Department is facilitating public consultation for the process, and in this regard details of the consultation were posted on the Department&rsquo;s website on 11 May 2012 and advertised in the Irish Independent on 16 May 2012 with a closing date of 28 June 2012. On request, this closing date was subsequently extended to 6 July 2012. This represents a consultation period of some eight weeks.  The closing date for submissions was set originally for the end of June in order to allow sufficient time for the consultants to properly consider submissions before the finalisation of their interim report but, of course, any further submissions received will also be forwarded to the consultants.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2012 my Department announced details of the 2012 Scheme for the Allocation of Milk Quota to New Entrants to Dairying, with a closing date of 4th May 2012.  Approximately 270 applications were received in my Department before this deadline. These applications were subject to a preliminary examination to ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria as set out in the Detailed Rules of the Scheme. All valid applications, including that received from the person named, have been submitted to the Assessment Panel for examination and it is expected that the Panel will have completed its work by mid August, at which time I hope to announce the results of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Assessment Panel will base its decisions on the contents and quality of the applications submitted, taking account of educational qualifications, experience and the quality of the Business Plan and other factors.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First</i> has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Indeed, a number of submissions to the Joint Committee on Health and Children as part of its recent examination of the draft Heads of the Children First Bill emphasised the progress which has already been made in implementing Children First in a wide range of organisations. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of <i>Children First</i> and in the case of the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <i>Children First</i> has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of <i>Children First</i> throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.</P>
        <P>In the draft legislative proposals on Children First it is proposed that organisations working with children appoint a Designated Officer.  It is proposed that the Designated Officer, along with certain named professionals, will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE.  To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a &lsquo;Guidance for Reporting of Abuse&rsquo; is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse.  The Guidance will assist designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, in considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation.  This approach is intended to ensure that only those cases which require an assessment by the HSE are brought to its attention.</P>
        <P>As regards the allocation of resources, this will be a matter to be considered both in the context of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency and the Regulatory Impact Analysis which will accompany the preparation of relevant legislation.</P>

	<P>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community child care not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced child care rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Because of the current budgetary situation no new places are available to service providers seeking to enter this programme in 2012.  However, in exceptional circumstances where a participating service closes or opts out of the programme, a new applicant may be considered to take up the vacated place in the programme if they are in a position to meet the child care need arising.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 362 together.</P>
        <P>Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways: Health-funded day services; F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training; Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</P>
        <P>Over 660 places are required for school leavers in 2012 and around 390 places in respect of those who are completing their RT course this year.  To date, suitable placements have been identified for 514 school leavers and 321 RT graduates.  This year, disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers from within their existing budgets. In previous years demographic funding was provided to meet this need. 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to additional challenges in service provision.</P>
        <P>Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals who require day and rehabilitative training places can be responded to within available resources.  The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  There are already many excellent examples of collaborative working between service providers and the HSE in innovatively responding to the needs of individuals.</P>
        <P>The HSE and disability service providers have commenced the process of notifying families if a place is available or if the individual is to be placed on a waiting list.  Where a service has yet to be identified parents/guardians are being advised that: the young person would be placed on a waiting list;the family would be kept informed of progress; and the HSE and the disability agency understood that this was a challenging time for families and would continue to explore all available options.</P>
        <P>Every effort is being made to achieve an equitable and sustainable outcome to address the current difficulties in providing an appropriate service to each individual. However, the Health Service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it and given the current economic environment this has become a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.</P>

	<P>Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  Suicide is a tragedy that we are constantly working to prevent and also working to give more support to the families affected.  <i>Reach Out</i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention sets out a series of specific actions and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.  There are up to 20 voluntary organisations part-funded by the HSE who are providing excellent prevention, intervention and post-intervention support services including phone help-lines and web based support.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is implementing the <i>Reach Out</i> Actions in a four way strategy &mdash; delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide.  The annual budget for this work has been increased by this Government to over &euro;12 million.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 to 322, inclusive, and 327 to 339, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The report of the HSE National Audiology Review Group was published in April 2011.  The Group has developed a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the inconsistencies and inadequacies in audiology services.  Recommendations currently being pursued by the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme include the following; five clinical leads including a National Clinical Lead are being recruited; Universal Newborn Hearing Screening(UNHS) is now in place in the HSE South and will be rolled out in Dublin Mid Leinster and Dublin North East in September 2012; the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) Service is to be rolled out to six new sites commencing in October 2012; work has been initiated on reconfiguration of services to deliver better clinical governance and efficient care pathways; ten MSc in audiology students are being sponsored and it is hoped they will join the HSE workforce in September 2013; other training is also being supported for staff involved in UNHS follow up and the BAHA service; procurement processes for equipment for the BAHA service and the UNHS programme have been completed; workforce planning and career structure proposals are being developed.</P>
        <P>The National Audiology Review Group Report estimated the annual investment in HSE audiology services at &euro;11.3m.  An additional &euro;989k was invested in 2011 and an additional &euro;2.71m in 2012.  Business cases for additional posts and funding will be prepared as part of the HSE estimates process.</P>
        <P>The budget for hearing aids is &euro;2m per year.  The HSE is currently completing a national procurement process for hearing aids and equipment and considers it inappropriate to make information available on the average cost of hearing aids purchased due to commercial sensitivity.  The estimated salary costs for the audiology service is &euro;4.5m.  Information on administration costs is not readily available and is difficult to determine given that staff are shared across services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is not in a position to provide accurate data as requested by the Deputy on waiting lists or on persons fitted with hearing aids, persons who received an audiology assessment or persons who received follow up appointments during 2011/2012.  The business case for a new National Patient Management System is being progressed which will allow easy access to waiting times, facilitate the validation of waiting list activity and monitor productivity.</P>

	<P>The calculation of the amount of fluoride to be added to water to obtain the optimal fluoride concentration is a mathematical formula which takes into account the concentration of the fluoridating agent and the volume of the water to be treated.  The basic formula is then adjusted to allow for existing background fluoride levels in order to provide that the fluoride concentration of the water is in line with the statutory requirement.</P>

	<P>The Special Delivery Unit (SDU)  is working  to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF. During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a maximum wait time for children of 20 weeks for an elective inpatient or day case procedure.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</P>

	<P>Funding for community based drugs projects supported by Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces is channelled through a number of Government Departments and State agencies, including certain local authorities.  A full breakdown of the grants by local authority area relating to the 2011 financial year and the period January to June 2012 is set out in the table. </P>
        <P>The attention of the Deputy is drawn to the fact that Dublin City Council ceased to operate as a channel of funding for my Department this year.  An alternative funding agency has been identified for each of the nine projects concerned, seven of which have transferred to the HSE, while the remaining two projects have been assigned to the City of Dublin VEC and the Canal Communities Partnership respectively.  The project previously funded through D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has not been allocated funding in 2012.</P>

	<P>Since 1 January 2012 the charges for patients who chose to be treated on a private basis in public hospitals have increased by between 3% and 5% depending on the category of hospital.  The increase in charges is in keeping with the long-standing policy of moving towards recovering the full economic cost of providing treatment to private patients in public hospitals.  It is anticipated that the increased charges will yield additional revenue in the region of &euro;18 million in 2012.  The current 2012 charges and the 2011 charges are set out in the following table.  </P>

	<P>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 which was published on Friday, the 13th of July, will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.</P>
        <P>It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the Health Service Executive.  The process provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in Ireland on condition that the professional practice is the same in both countries.  In the case of radiography qualifications, the process is administered on behalf of my Department by the National Validation Office of the Health Service Executive (NVO) which is advised by the Irish Institute of Radiography and Radiation Therapy (IIRRT).</P>
        <P>In the case of the person to whom the Deputy refers, I am advised that the NVO and my Department are awaiting clarification on certain aspects of the application from the IIRRT.  When this clarification is received, my Department will be in touch with the applicant.</P>

	<P>The Pilot Training College Waterford (PTCW) is a privately owned and operated flight training college.  The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has responsibility for approving flight training organisations in Ireland. In this regard their primary functions are the oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered, the conduct of examinations and flight tests and I have referred the question to the Authority for direct reply in relation to their functions.  However, I would like to note that I have agreed with the IAA that the IAA will fund the flight costs of those self-financing students in Florida who have an existing contract with PTCW and who wish to leave the USA. I will also give consideration to a bonding /insurance scheme in future to provide financial protection for students of flight training organisations; however, such a scheme would most likely be on a voluntary basis.   </P>
        <P>The IAA is endeavouring to ensure that the students affected will be able to avail of alternative training arrangements.  It has also indicated that it will strive to facilitate the crediting of all flight and ground training carried out to date in Florida towards the students&rsquo; final qualifications.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 to 385, inclsuive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of the taxi industry and is also the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report. The Review Report makes no recommendations on limiting the ownership of a taxi licence as mentioned. Instead the Report focuses on a package of measures designed to enhance standards and encourage professional drivers to operate in the sector.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to introduce any financial incentives for individuals to exit the taxi market such as those measures suggested by the Deputy. The use of licence fee income is a matter, for the NTA in the first instance, subject to the requirements of section 50 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003. </P>
        <P>In the case of licence transferrability , a major anomoly was identified in that taxi licences issued prior to January can be sold or transferred on one occasion. It was considered that it was necessary to move away from a system whereby a licence will have value in itself &mdash; a licence should determine a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market. Action 14 of the Review Report proposes the introduction of a prohibition on the transferability of taxi vehicle licences such that all taxi vehicle licences will be unique to the person to whom the licence has been issued and cannot be transferred or sold to another individual. The legal aspects of the proposal are being examined as part of the implementation process.</P>
        <P>I would not be in favour of slogans or other displays on taxis that could be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as inviting the customer to discriminate on racial grounds.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 to 389, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>As part of the Taxi Regulation Review in 2011, the independent consultants, Indecon, were engaged to carry out an economic analysis of the taxi market. The Indecon analysis indicated that a problem of over-supply caused by fall in demand in the previous 3-4 years was not being matched by a corresponding level of market exit.</P>
        <P>The Taxi Review Group agreed that the future approach to taxi regulation was to improve standards and to strengthen enforcement of the taxi regulations and did not justify imposing quantitative restrictions on the sector. The programme of reform outlined in the Report is designed to raise standards and to curb non-compliance thereby leading to a level playing field for legitimate operators in the sector. It is intended that the effect of the Report reforms will be to assist in tackling contributory factors to oversupply in the sector and to create a more vigorously regulated market that will reward legitimate operators and give consumers more confidence in the taxi market.</P>
        <P>The Taxi Review Group was composed of representatives from the key stakeholder groups &mdash; representing consumers and the taxi industry, including dispatch operators, full-time taxi drivers and vehicle licence holders. </P>
        <P>As to the so-called &ldquo;nine year rule&rdquo;, last year the National Transport Authority (NTA) carried out a public consultation on vehicle standards, which included vehicle age.  The outcome of the consultation was made available for the consideration of the Taxi Regulation Review Group. Action 10 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report proposes that existing vehicles in the fleet prior to 1st January 2009, should be allowed to operate until they are a maximum of 14 years of age, subject to passing a roadworthiness test and an NTA licence renewal assessment at six monthly intervals for vehicles that are nine years or older. Action 10 is being implemented by the NTA.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few days my Department received a preliminary estimate of the cost of damage caused by the severe weather event of 28th June last. The communication stresses that the figures supplied are estimates and may not be complete. </P>
        <P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. </P>
        <P>The 2012 regional and local road grant allocations have now been allocated and there are no further funds available at this time from which an additional allocation could be made. In addition, my Department does not set aside funding in its budget to cover expenditure resulting from severe weather. Instead, local authorities are provided with flexibility, where possible, to amend their Regional and Local Road Grants to accommodate remedial works. I can confirm that I will facilitate any request by Cork County Council to amend its Programme for 2012 to accommodate rehabilitation works on the roads damaged by the recent floods and the deferral to 2013 of less critical works.</P>

	<P>Swim Ireland and the Olympic Council of Ireland are independent, autonomous bodies.  The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport, which includes responsibility for dealing with the recognised sporting organisations and the allocation of funding to same.  </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Irish Sports Council that the allocation of funding to National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) is based on a detailed application form and is for core funding and programmes such as Women in Sport and the High Performance Programme.  NGBs are accountable to the Irish Sports Council in respect of the grants allocated to them by the Council, which must be expended on an agreed programme only.</P>
        <P>I have no official function in relation to the remuneration of personnel within the organisations mentioned by the Deputy.  I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Irish Sports Council for a more detailed response in relation to the funding provided by them to Swim Ireland and the Olympic Council of Ireland.

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 working in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </P>
        <P>Similarly the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Act. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</P>
        <P>State grants for regional and local roads are intended to supplement authorities&rsquo; own funds. The allocation of funds from my Department, and previously from the Department of the Environment, has evolved over time to reflect changes in programmes and in the availability of funding. In recent times programmes have been changed or amalgamated to provide flexibility to the local authorities to meet their individual needs and to react to local issues and events.  All of the works on regional and local roads which are funded by my Department are in the first instance prioritised by individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by my Department to ensure that the allocation to individual county councils is equitable in terms of the length of road within each county and the usage of such roads.</P>
