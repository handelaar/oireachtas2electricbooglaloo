      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that during last month letters had been sent to several shopkeepers in Naas, Newbridge, and Kildare, by the Inspector of Taxes of the 7th District, demanding information as to how the amounts returned by them as profits seven years ago were arrived at, requiring copies of these traders' accounts for the three years preceding the 5th April, 1923, and copies of their bank deposit accounts, and bank pass books for the same period, which would involve a general examination of their trading accounts for the past ten years; whether the accounts of the parties to whom such letters were sent have <Col N="806" /> been investigated by at least four inspectors of taxes during the period referred to; and whether, in some of the cases the assessments during that period were on one or more occasions the subject of appeal to the Special Commissioners or the Judge of the Circuit Court; whether he is aware that in this district in the case of the estates of deceased persons leaving any liquid assets attempts have been made to investigate the deceased's affairs for a like period of ten years, with consequent expense and trouble to the executors and all concerned; whether these demands have been confined to County Kildare or apply to the country generally; whether threats of criminal proceedings for nondisclosure have been made in certain cases by the inspector with a view to compelling traders and others to submit to an investigation of their affairs from the year 1914 to the present time, and to obtain from them agreements or consent to pay tax or payment in lieu of tax for the years prior to 1923; and whether the Minister will take steps to insure that in the administration of the Income Tax Acts these traders (whose business is at present passing through a period of acute depression) are not unduly pressed with such repeated and searching investigations, and will he put some reasonable limit of time on the period of such inquiries.</P>

      <P>This question raises the same general matter that was dealt with fully in reply to questions by Deputy Wolfe on 10th July last and I would refer the Deputy to columns 602 to 608 of the Official Report of that date for the answers. If, having considered those answers, the Deputy considers that the action of the Inspector in any specific case is not in accordance with the principles enunciated therein, and if he will bring the matter to my notice, I shall be glad to look into it.</P>

      <P>The result of the enquiries made on the spot into the conditions of the six families which left Inistrahull last year for the mainland did not disclose any case for State assistance or intervention.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that as far as the people on this island are concerned their occupation has been seriously interfered with by the operations of foreign trawlers?

As far as the other two families are concerned, any application that came from them to my Department was not for things that could be supplied by the Department.  There were no applications for loans for boats or <Col N="810" /> gear, but there were applications for a money grant to tide them over the winter.

      <P>It has been decided that the total membership of the council shall be 35.  The question for decision on amendment 20 is whether there should be a commercial register and, since we have altered the membership of the council from 25 to 35, I take it that we may substitute the word &ldquo;thirty&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; in line 42.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now take amendment 20, and on that amendment will put the Question: That the words &ldquo;in this <Col N="813" /> Act referred to as ordinary members&rdquo; in lines 42-43 stand.  That Question will give a decision on the point as to whether or not there is to be a commercial register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 20, which reads:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 42 and 43, to delete the words &ldquo;of whom thirty (in this Act referred to as ordinary members)&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;who,&rdquo; and to delete all words after the word &ldquo;electors,&rdquo; line 45, to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>As you have stated, sir, the substance of that amendment, if carried, means the deletion of the special commercial franchise from the Bill. We object very strenuously to this revival of a system of franchise which most people thought was not alone dead but buried half a century ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal contained in the Bill is an effort to bring to light again the old system and the old principle of giving votes according to the amount of one's property or, as somebody said some weeks ago in a weekly publication which I read, according to the size of one's bank balance.  That is a principle that we object to.  We think that the most just principle in local government, as well as in national affairs, is one man one vote.  I cannot see how any possible injustice would be done to the commercial community by adhering to that principle. Anybody in Dublin, or outside of it, who has experience of <Col N="814" /> local government knows that in the past the franchise that is now in existence for local government afforded every possible opportunity to commercial men, as well as every other class in the community, to get representation.  My belief is that, in so far as they sought, business men and commercial men got full representation on local boards and councils. At least, that applies to those with whom I was acquainted.  To seek to set up for the commercial community a type of special franchise similar to that set up under certain laws for them in the case of the Port and Docks Board is, to my mind, indefensible.  I cannot see any reason on earth to justify it.  Those who have property have, no doubt, a great interest in the city.  Those who have business have a great interest in the city.  But even in proportion to their higher, valuations they have not a greater interest in the city than their own employees or the poorer classes of the community. Whether rich or poor, one pays in rates in the same proportion.  One does not always pay it on the valuation of one's property.  The poor pay it in their cost of living.  It is in the things they buy they pay their rates. I think it would be a grave injustice on the people to put this principle in the Bill.  There is no special demand for it that I know of on the part of the commercial community.  I believe the proposal in the Bill is entirely unjustifiable, and we will oppose it to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repudiate very clearly that this proposal is giving a vote to property or attaching a vote to persons because of the size of their bank balances.  I pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill that of the total valuation of the old city, about £1,200,000, as much as £600,000 represented property occupied, not for the purposes of enjoyment of occupation or personal use, but occupied by persons engaged in trade, commerce and manufacture.  It is now suggested that the present principle of giving a vote to a local government elector because of the fact that he is a rated <Col N="815" /> occupier is not just.  We are told that the local government franchise should be &ldquo;one man one vote,&rdquo; like the franchise for the Dáil.  Let that be discussed on its merits and in the right place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand, it is not proposed to discuss on this Bill whether the ordinary local government franchise or electorate should be changed or not in respect to the new system.  What is implied in this Bill is that if the basis of the local government vote is the occupation of rateable premises, then it is unsound and unjust that, if we simply regard the statistics of the old city, one-half of the rateable premises should be unvoiced in the matter of local government.  The Bill proposes that a voice shall be given to the persons who bear the burden of the rates; it is proposed to give it to them in a circumscribed and in a special way.  It is realised that the commercial and the business community in the city have a special function in the city's life to exercise, if they do exercise it, in giving voice to the public policy of the city's administration.  I made it clear on the Second Reading that we desire to see in the council of the city men who can speak for the business side of the city's life.  We desire to give them an opportunity of being present at that Council without having to run the gamut of the ordinary public election, which involves going on the hustings and engaging in expense.  We are not giving them a voice that will be in any way a turning point in the discussions of the Council.  We propose that in a Council of thirty-five they shall have five.  I am only quoting the figures for comparative purposes.  The total valuation will be £1,700,000 and I am assuming that the commercial valuation is half the valuation of the present city.  We are giving thirty seats on the Council to the ordinary electorate, who will cover something more than half the rateable valuation in the city.  We are giving five voices in the Council to persons <Col N="816" /> elected by the purely business community and representing a valuation that will go to nearly half the valuation of the new city.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we have heard from time to time criticism by the business organisations in the city of the general conduct of municipal affairs.  Only recently, from one of the other county boroughs in the country, I had representations from the Chamber of Commerce that the city was being mismanaged, that the system should be changed and that we should send down there a commissioner.  The occupations of business people who speak in that particular way are such that they cannot face the electorate.  We want to give them representation, to saddle them with the responsibility that attaches to it, and we want to give them no excuse for not being in the city councils and not speaking their minds there.</P>
    <P>It is usually easy for a group of business people to criticise people from outside and to say that everything is all wrong.  They will be much more effective if they are inside learning the difficulties and helping to overcome them.  We want them to shoulder their part in the general giving of advice, the sizing up of difficulties, and the framing of policy.  There are these very ample and sound reasons for introducing this system of representation for the commercial community.  I would like to say, at this stage, that amendment 36 makes it more clear than it is in the Bill that non-Saorstát bodies will not have a voice in the election of representatives in the city council.  I propose to accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks, has paid a very poor compliment indeed to the business people of this city when he has made it clear that his reasons for adopting this peculiar method, and enshrining it in the Bill, of giving special representation, are because he could not get the business people to take their due share of responsibility unless this particular <Col N="817" /> form of inducement was held out. They cannot be expected to undertake the expense of going before the electorate; they cannot be expected to be put to the trouble of going before the electorate; they cannot be expected to engage in the job of putting their particular view as to the interests of the city before the electorate. They must be put in a special, privileged position before they do what the ordinary citizens ought to do and what they, who are supposed to have a greater interest in the city than the ordinary elector, should be expected more readily to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the case the Minister makes for them.  It is a poor case, and a poor tribute to the businessmen of the city.  There are businessmen, I am glad to say, who do take an interest in the welfare of the city and in the welfare of the community generally who do not shirk their civic responsibilities, who undertake them to the fullest extent and do useful work.  I say that whether I agree with their particular point of view or not.  There is altogether too much, on the part of businessmen, superior contempt for those who do engage in the civic work or take part in civic or political activities&mdash;that kind of superior air that suggests that these people are doing this for their own or for selfish purposes. We have too much of that kind of thing from the business community of the country, and we have it not from the best element of the business community.  The Minister is pandering to that supposed superiority when he goes out of his way and introduces into this Bill this particular form of inducement to bring in this kind of elector.  I think I will be justified, although I may be anticipating to some extent, in referring to the register which the section sets up.  I do so in reference to what the Minister for Education said in defending the proposal.  He said on the Second Reading Stage (column 1001): &ldquo;It was not because people have property of a certain amount&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister repeated that to-day&mdash;&ldquo;that they were given <Col N="818" /> an extra vote, this special representation. It was because they represented business interests and presumably gave employment.&rdquo;  That is the ground on which it is supposed to be given.  But there is nothing in the Bill which says that.  There is no provision in the Bill for that.  A person may give no employment whatsoever and be entitled to this special representation or get on this special register.  A bookmaker may have a big house with a big valuation and set apart one room as an office.  He would be entitled to claim under Section 32 to be put on the special register. If the Minister is really serious that this is intended to apply to people who are giving employment in the city, then he will have no hesitation in accepting Deputy Davin's amendment, No. 42, which makes that point quite clear.  As it stands at present, there is no such safeguard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not said, either on the Second Reading or now, why he confines this to Dublin.  If it is good for Dublin, it ought to be good for Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the coastal borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>And the coastal borough.  There is no such provision for the coastal borough.  What is the reason that this special provision is made for Dublin?  If the principle is sound, is there any reason why it should be confined to Dublin?  I said in my Second Reading speech practically all that is necessary to say on the general principle. I do not want to repeat it. It certainly does not seem to me to be right that we should in this way give special inducements to people who, because their interests are affected, are not prepared to undertake the responsibilities that they ought to undertake.  If business interests are affected in the city they have their opportunity for getting on the Council if they wish to undertake these responsibilities.  I think it is reviving a reactionary principle to bring in this proposal for a commercial <Col N="819" /> register in the way in which it is being done in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that on the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister referred to the amount of rates paid on business premises as distinct from ordinary residential premises.  He quoted a figure of £600,000, which is half the amount of rates in question.  I pointed out that in that figure was included rates payable on premises which would not be included in this commercial register at all.  The Minister has not yet produced figures in that regard.  If we turn to Section 32 in item C of sub-section (2) we will find that in spite of all the talk about business and manufacturing concerns that are to benefit by this clause we also have included the professions. There are a great many houses occupied in the city by doctors, dentists, solicitors, maternity nurses, masseures, that would come under this particular heading in a commercial register.  I do not think that the Minister has given any reason why this step should be taken to give the business community or the so-called business community, any extra representation when we also have brought into line with them the professional community. The amendment in Deputy Doyle's name certainly goes a long way to do away with the danger that I pointed out on the Second Reading of those multiple shops, whose owners are not resident here, being included under this section of the Bill.  I would like to know if the Minister is prepared to delete item C to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to hear the Deputy argue that a consulting engineer who keeps a staff working, an architect who keeps a staff working, or a dentist who keeps a staff working at mechanical work, assuming that they are occupying premises for the purpose of carrying on their business, should not be regarded as on the same plane, say, as a shopkeeper.  The difficulty about the professions is that one particular <Col N="820" /> class of profession employs a certain number of people and that a member of another profession employs a couple of assistants or somebody to mind the door or keep his letters for him.  There is a difficulty in finding a line in the professions.  You have those who do give employment and those who do not.  I would like to hear the Deputy argue that the architect, the consulting engineer, or the dentist who give employment should be left out.</P>

Surely to goodness, there is no man now sitting in this House who had any associations with the Sinn Féin movement who would be capable of coming forward at that particular period to try and justify a proposal of this kind?  I suppose the President is too innocent to admit even now what he would have said about such a proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is to put a premium on those with the money as against those with brains.  The Chairman or Managing Director of a firm like Todd Burns, Arnotts, or other business houses of that kind, who occupies that position because of his money or the shareholding interest which he has in the concern, is going to be put six times over the head of the manager, who is the man who is supposed to know how to conduct the business.  The manager of Todd Burns, for instance, who is, I suppose, receiving a fairly good salary and who lives in a moderately valued house in a place like Drumcondra, will get only one vote whereas the chairman or managing director, because he controls the purse, will get six.  That is the democratic outlook which the Minister holds to-day.  I would ask him whether he is prepared to allow the House to say by a free vote what it thinks of this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, for his valuable time.  Would the Minister, from his experience of the working of the new Act in the City of Cork, say that that experience justifies him in coming before this House with a proposal of this kind?  I am informed that there are twenty-one members in the Cork City Council and that five or six of them are some of the best business men in Cork.  They went on the hustings on their merits and as a result of their brains and intellect, not because they had money behind them, they got their proportionate representation in the council.  Can the President deny that?  If these people in Cork were elected on their merits as business men why give these people in Dublin a privileged position?  Nothing has been said by the Minister, either inside or outside this House, which would justify that proposal except that he wants to give a privileged position to people with money but people with money have not always the best brains.  He will allow these people to sit in secret in Commercial Buildings and select four or five persons from among themselves for membership of the Corporation.  We know how voting goes in the Commercial Buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that one of the biggest slum-owners in the city&mdash;I <Col N="823" /> think the President knows him but I will not mention names&mdash;will be eligible for membership of the council as a commercial candidate.  He has big business premises in Dublin and he is also one of the biggest slum owners.  He probably will be put up by the people who control the Commercial Buildings and such high-class institutions in the city, people who are supposed to have brains though I do not admit it.  The man to whom I refer will be regarded as a super-citizen, capable of advising the council on housing schemes.  This big slum owner who will probably get into the council by being a commercial candidate will be put in that privileged position.  Does the Minister admit that a man of that kind would be a proper person to advise the city council in regard to housing schemes?</P>

      <P>Or, as Deputy O'Connell says, the extraordinary man.  He is an ordinary man because he has not the money, and he is ordinary from the point of view of the Minister because Deputy Good does not speak for him.  I am sure that Deputy Good has had a good deal to do with the introduction of this particular clause in the Bill.  I suggest to Deputy Good that if the business men for whom he speaks would give serious consideration to the proposal in the Bill they would, if they were intelligent men, regard it as an insult. The Minister says that the moneved classes in the city represent £600,000 of rateable valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I <Col N="824" /> said that persons occupying premises for the purpose of carrying on business there, as distinct from being resident there, represent a valuation of that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the strength of the Minister's statement they would be entitled to have representation on the city council, and the offer of five out of thirty-five seats is nothing short of an insult to intelligent business men.  I cannot, of course, forget the fact that I am one of the hard-hatted members of the House, but I could use language which would damn the Bill in a very few words, but the Chair would probably not allow me to use it.  At any rate, I think that the majority of the members of this House have a sufficiently democratic outlook and that they will, by the free vote which we have now been promised, condemn this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour gentleman, the hard-hatted Deputy, who has just sat down, asked a question. He wanted to know whether the rates were passed on to the cost of articles sold by business men.  He assumed that that is the case.  We know that he speaks without the slightest knowledge of what he is talking about.  He has never been engaged in business and knows nothing about it.  I have been engaged in business since I was fifteen years of age and I know what I am talking about.  I can tell the Deputy who makes these high-sounding assertions that there is not a scintilla of evidence for that statement.  There is £125,000 in rates borne by the business community, but no part of it will be passed on to the public.  I doubt if a penny of it will go on to goods sold across the counter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easily explained. The volume of trade in the city is so limited, and the competition to obtain it so keen, no man dare increase the price of the goods he sells, as otherwise they would be left on the shelf.  That is the position in Dublin.  When these statements are <Col N="825" /> made from the Labour Benches I can assure the members who make them that there is not the slightest justification for them.  The Minister asked Labour Deputies a plain, honest question.  He asked them how they proposed to give representation in the City Council to that section of the community who are assessed on something like £628,000. There was no answer forthcoming, and if they are not able to answer that question they should not raise their voices.  Such statements are simply all sound and fury, but there is no logic in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that without this provision in regard to a special register the business people would be unvoiced in the administration of the city.  In Cork, however, the business people have secured about one-third of the representation without this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork is a very intellectual city, you know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well. The presumption is that if these people were, as Deputy O'Connell suggests, the ordinary business people in the city, they would also get one-third of the representation. If I had my way they might get less. At any rate, they would get one-third out of the thirty, and now you propose to give them one-third plus five other members.  That would be practically half&mdash;fifteen out of thirty-five.  I think that this provision is not capable of any amendment at all.  It does not matter whether people are employed or not by these big ratepayers.  The experience of the city administration is that when these big persons had control of the city in the old days it was neglected.  It was not until there was a more democratic council put into power that improvements took place in the city in every department. I believe that if you are going to give these people what really amounts to control of the council, the interests of the city&mdash; that is, the interests of the ordinary person who must live in the city, and who cannot go off fifty or sixty miles <Col N="826" /> after business in a fast car&mdash;will suffer.  You are going to have a state of affairs in the city such as existed thirty or forty years ago, if they have their way.  I would like to ask any business man here, or anyone speaking on their behalf, is it for the love of the people whom they employ that they employ them?  I am sure they get full value out of their employees.  They exploit the people who work for them, and they exploit the public, and they are not entitled to any special representation on that account.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made no case whatever for this provision.  Whatever valuation their premises possess has been given to them by the people who work for them, the people who patronise them, the people who buy from them or give them orders.  They have attained their present position because of these two facts.  Speaking from experience of the past&mdash;it was before my time, but I know the tradition&mdash; I say we are going to have a repetition of the state of affairs which prevailed when these people had power before.  You will have these people clearing off, caring not one button for what becomes of the city.  There is no case whatever for giving more than one vote to these people.  It is a nice state of affairs that when practically every country in the world is extending the franchise we are going back.  I have my own ideas about the franchise.  People who rule the world do not sit in Parliaments.  I think it is simply a plan to humbug the people, but it is the people with the money who rule. It is simply a device to give people the impression that they really control the city when there are people behind the scenes who pull the strings all the time.  We cannot, however, fool the people all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>A reference was made by Deputy Davin a moment or two ago as to what might have happened ten or fifteen years ago if this proposal were brought forward by the British Government and as to what my views were on the subject. <Col N="827" /> I might remind Deputy Davin that I offered to resign my seat to secure the election of, I think, the late Lord Tveagh.  Another member &mdash;speaking from recollection, though I may be at fault, I think it was Deputy O'Kelly&mdash;offered to withdraw in order that, I think, Mr. William Martin Murphy might be elected to the city council.  Perhaps it was the late.  Dr. McWalter who offered to resign with me.  What was the idea? The idea was to try and associate more closely with the business management of the city those who for one reason or another kept aloof. Some business men concern themselves almost exclusively with their own business.  They think their business will not afford the loss of time which attention to public administration might involve.  The business community, generally speaking, have been to a considerable extent divorced from association with the management of the municipality for a very considerable period.  Some of them have been associated with it, but we do not get any further by simply pouring abuse on any order in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation is made up of all parties and one party is just as essential as another.  Business depends to a very considerable extent on top management as well as the efficient discharge of their duties by the lowest paid persons in the establishment.  It is the harmony of the whole staff which results in success.  There are many cases in the city of well-managed businesses which have grown out of very small beginnings, and which are an ornament not alone to the city, but to the whole nation.  Is it not possible in connection with the future management of the city of Dublin to have some association such as that, not exactly perhaps in the same form, to harness as far as possible business and all the other interests of the municipality together?  A few years ago it would have been much easier to secure what we would call nonpolitical election to a public body than it is now.  The bigger parties <Col N="828" /> in the State usually divide what there is of representation between them and leave a small representation to the brainy parties, such as that to which Deputy Davin belongs. I think that Deputy Boland does not weigh what he says sometimes in certain matters before he speaks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the year 1898 there was a special register in respect of representation in the city. That was what Deputy Davin would call a privileged franchise on which certain persons were elected.  Somewhere about the same year as the Public Health (Ireland) Act was passed&mdash;I think it was 1878&mdash;a company was formed here in Dublin, principally by large business men, manufacturers and others.  They subscribed very largely to the shares of the company.  One of the most successful and up-to-date housing schemes was embarked upon by this company.  They built something like 5,000 houses in and around the city, and it was mainly business men who supported that.  They made a remarkable contribution towards the solution of a problem which was not so widely spoken of at that time as it is now.  They made a remarkable success of it, and they paid something like 5 per cent.  They gave practically as good value as the Corporation gave afterwards when they had an opportunity of making up any deficit in rates.  The circumstances were slightly different.  They did not go in for clearing slum areas or incur any costs such as that.  In one case they got a site, on which the Corporation had spent £1,500 to clear, for £150.  When Deputy Boland is made aware of these facts perhaps he will not be so ready to make an attack on men who made <Col N="829" /> that remarkable contribution to the city.</P>
      <P>Similarly it was during that period that the Vartry waterworks were started.  They had also under consideration proposals for the main drainage of the city.  That, however, is not exactly the point in regard to this matter.  This is not a watering down of the franchise as such; this is an addition to the franchise. If there were such a thing in our universities as a faculty of public administration and if there were graduates or people who took a post-graduate course there, I would have no objection to adding some of these person to the personnel of the Council of the municipality for the advantage of whatever light and leading they can give to a body of that sort.  The real proposal underlying this clause, which the Minister has introduced without being requested by any business body, or any body of business men, or any individuals amongst the business community &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some persons from Cork were late in asking that the franchise, in so far as the qualifications of persons to be elected are concerned, should extend to managing directors of public companies in connection with the Cork Bill.  The proposal came too late for embodiment in the Bill.  Other than that, no other request, no other suggestion, no other recommendation, came from any source, and the Minister stands over the proposal such <Col N="830" /> as it is, and I stand immediately behind him, and possibly on the same line.</P>

      <P>As I have said, it is an addition; it is a help; it is an endeavour to associate business with the management of the city.  It is, as the Minister said, an opportunity to let them see each proposal in its ordinary, normal course, before it comes on the estimates, before the rates are struck, and not what we have been accustomed to, that when the rate was about to be struck, or when the estimates were about to be <Col N="831" /> considered, somebody suggested very large reductions.  We want them to be in possession of all the facts.  If they do not know that there is such a matter as housing, and such questions as public health and so on, it is time that they should.  This affords facility for them.  Furthermore, it gives a further inducement to manufacturers and industrialists to come into and have confidence in the City of Dublin.  They will be able to appreciate much more markedly the difficulties and perplexities of modern municipal government.  It will, as I have said, give them confidence. It will bring other persons in contact with them and lessen a good deal the acrimony that is unfortunately in public life, and of which we have had a very small example here to-day.</P>

      <P>The President said that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce did not ask for the privileges the Government propose to give in this Bill.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce would never dare to come to the President and ask that the new Dublin Council should be impeded by the addition of the antique furniture which the Government now suggest should be added to it.  Both the President and the Minister seemed to be anxious to give the Dáil the impression that if Deputy O'Kelly's amendment is carried the business men, as such, will have no voice in the election of members of the municipal council.  That is not correct. If the amendment is carried, the business men will have just as much say in the election of members to the council as any other individuals in the city.  What the President and the Minister and the Government are proposing to do is to ensure that a certain section of the community will have a minimum of two votes each and a maximum of seven; to ensure that they will be able to exercise an undue influence in the election of members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President also appeared to be anxious to create the impression that if this commercial register is not approved of business men will not <Col N="832" /> secure election to the municipal council.  Surely we should be guided in matters of this kind by experience. The proposal to establish a commercial register was not contained in the Cork Bill; it is in this Bill.  Presumably, therefore, the Government have had their outlook changed by their experience of the working of the Cork Bill.  Is it a fact that in Cork business men had no voice in the election of the council or failed to secure adequate representation at the election?  The fact is that the business candidates in the City of Cork secured a greater representation than was secured by the two political parties put together, although the President has assured us that they would get the bulk of the representation in normal circumstances.  Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil between them got a smaller number of candidates elected than those who stood as business candidates with the nomination of the Chamber of Commerce. In the City of Cork, the business element got an undue share of the representation.  If there is one fault in the Cork City Act, it is that on the council there is a preponderance of business men and a deficiency of labour representatives. Therefore if this Bill was being framed in the light of the Dáil's experience of the working of the Cork Act, we would have here a proposal to institute a special register to provide that the representation of labour would be adequate and not the representation of business.  Has it been our experience that business men are reluctant to seek election to the Dáil and Seanad?  Is it not a fact that at every election for the Dáil, at any rate, the ballot papers are littered with the names of so-called business candidates anxious to save the country from bankruptcy? Is there anyone here that honestly believes that business men will not seek election unless they are given special privileges denied to other sections of the community? Our experience has been quite the contrary.  Not merely in Dáil elections, but in local government elections, <Col N="833" /> persons describing themselves as business men, or ratepayers, or something of that kind are always evident in greater numbers than the candidates of political parties as such or candidates representing labour interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, how many business men are in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell the Deputy in a minute why they were defeated.  One reason is that business men have such extraordinary ideas about economic matters as those expressed by the Deputy to-day when he told us that business men did not pay rates out of profits.  What do they pay them out of, if they do not pay them out of the profits of the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the Deputy was quite emphatic that the rates of business men are not recovered from their customers in the price of the ordinary articles they sell.  Where do they get them?  Are they paid out of dividends on shares or are they paid out of their private incomes or are they paid by robbing banks?  We all know that business men get them out of the cost that they charge in prices to their customers in the ordinary articles they sell.  If the Deputy would go to the technical school and take an elementary lesson in economics he would understand why it is the people of Dublin do not elect those whom he describes as business men but who do not know anything about business economics.  If this principle is valid in relation to the Municipal Council of Dublin why should it not be valid in relation to every other local government body and is it not valid in relation to this Dáil?  Is it not as desirable that we should have business men members of the Dáil as well as members of the Municipal Council? If they have any special ability to bring to the consideration of financial problems or special experience which it is desirable should be <Col N="834" /> utilised there is just as strong a case for giving them special privilege to insure their election to the Dáil as to the Municipal Council.  Are we to take it that this proposal of the Minister foreshadows another proposal to establish a commercial register in connection with the election of people to this House?  What case can the Minister make for having a commercial register for the Dublin Municipal Council and not for the Dáil? The amount of money dealt with here is larger than that dealt with by the Dublin Municipal Council. The issues that arise here for decision are just as important and in many cases more important to the business men of the city than the interests that arise in the Municipal Council.  If the presence of these business men at the Council is essential for the proper determination of these questions then their presence here is equally essential. The whole principle behind this section of the Bill is that administrative ability in individuals increases or decreases with the individual's wealth.  There is a theory evident in the mind of the Executive Council that only those who have substantial bank balances or the control of business establishments in the city will be properly able to decide what is the best municipal policy in relation to housing, or sewerage or drainage for the Dublin Council to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also evidently a belief that the business men will not come forward for election unless they are induced to do so, or will not be elected if they come forward unless the road is made particularly easy for them.  Our experience is contrary to the Minister's belief in both these matters.  In fact, business men were not hesitant about coming forward to seek election, and, in fact, in municipal affairs at any rate, they never failed to get their due share of representation.  In Cork they got more than their due share. Deputy Byrne asked why there were not more business men represented in this House.  The reason is because business men are a failure in politics. That is our experience here, that those who claim to speak for business <Col N="835" /> men, and whose only claim for election is that they are business men, have not been a success as politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible. I am a business man.  But that is our experience.  I say it has not been merely our experience, but the experience also of other countries. It has been the experience of England. This theory that a business government was necessary held great sway in England, particularly approaching the end of the War, and immediately afterwards, and a number of business men were brought into the Cabinet, every one of whom was a failure.  Their inefficiency brought the Coalition Government into disrepute.  The same occurred in the United States of America.  It was business men's administration that gave rise to the great seandal figuring in the Press lately in the United States.  Business men as a class are proved to be more corrupt than any other section of the community.  Their corruption is not signalised by the taking of small bribes.  They are corrupt on a bigger scale, and the fact is that business men, as a rule, although there are honourable exceptions, only seek election to public positions in order to serve some special class of business interests.  There are, of course, individuals in this House now, and individuals who occasionally seek election to this House under the name of business men, but who should not be described as such at all, for they are really politicians, and their main purpose in seeking to come here is to serve a particular political viewpoint always associated <Col N="836" /> with the Chamber of Commerce in the City of Dublin&mdash;business men whose only claim to election is not that they are business men, but that they have been a success as politicians. The reason is obvious.  The business man is there to consider profits.  His one concern is to produce a balance sheet, to show a profit at the end of the year.  Politicians are concerned, not with profits, but with principles.  The business man does not know what principles are, or he ceases to be a business man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The business man who would consider principles and not profits would soon be in the Bankruptcy Court.  We must also consider the fact that the classes of the community represented by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce are in the main associated with one political idea, and the main effect of this proposal is to ensure that persons supporting that political idea will be given that privilege of representation in the Dublin Council.  I do not say that that was the main consideration that influenced the Government or one of the considerations, but it is one of the effects of the proposal they have brought forward and which they might at this stage give consideration to.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kelly mentioned the desirability of standing for the principle of one man, one vote.  That is not merely a slogan; it crystallises the experience of mankind in this matter of municipal and national government.  The existing idea concerning the methods of government represents the experience of mankind for over 1,000 years and that experience is crystallised in the slogan, &ldquo;One man, one vote.&rdquo;  This proposal to give certain individuals, in some cases, two, three, four, five, six, and even seven, votes is a decidedly retrograde step and is contrary to the experience of all mankind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to create the impression that the business men whose names will figure on the commercial register would not have votes if that register were not there.  Everyone of them will have votes except the foreign companies which the Minister now proposes to exclude.  The only case for this commercial register was that by it votes would be given to foreign companies who pay rates in the city, but the Minister is going to exclude foreign companies; every member of a partnership, every member of a company which will figure on the commercial register will have his vote as an individual.  If he is interested in municipal politics he will be able to influence the course of municipal politics.  If he wants to be elected as a member of the municipal council he will be eligible to become elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, the condition used to exist that before a person would be eligible to seek election, he had to be a registered local government voter for the area concerned.  The Minister's proposal is to abolish that qualification in relation to the City of Dublin for persons whose names are on the commercial register. Voters on the commercial register can vote for individuals who need not necessarily be ratepayers in the city.  The Minister is going, in this particular matter, back beyond the point which was gained by the forces of democracy in 1898.  It is a decidedly retrograde and undemocratic step.  There are arguments in favour of democracy, despite what Deputies on the other side appear to think.  Deputy Tierney and others, on the Second Reading, objected to Fianna Fáil standing for democracy. We do not mind their objections, provided they are prepared to stand for it and so long as there is somebody ready to urge that democracy has not been a failure.  We at least are quite satisfied that democracy has not been a failure.  We believe it is worth trying still as a method of government until some better system <Col N="838" /> has been suggested.  No better system has yet been suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister's idea of giving special privileges to the moneyed classes is not an improvement.  Before we break the working rule of government which the experience of mankind has hammered out over a few thousand years, we want a better case than that put forward by the Minister.  The Minister's case was based on two misinterpretations of fact.  He based his argument first on the idea that business men would not have votes at all unless the commercial register was instituted; and, secondly, that business men would not be elected at all unless special privileges were granted them.  Our experience is contrary to that belief in both these matters.  Business men will have their due share of influence in the next election to the city council under the present local government rules, and they will not be in the least bit hesitant about coming forward to seek election if they think their own personal or sectional interest can be benefited by being there.  There is no case for the commercial register.  I believe members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party who give this matter any consideration will be prepared to support the amendment.  It has been pointed out that in this matter there will be a free vote and that the Government Whips are not going to be applied.  We are told that each individual will be free to vote in accordance with his conscience.  We ask Deputies on the opposite side to realise that democracy as a working rule has not been superseded, and until it has they should stand for democracy in the municipal council of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down is usually well informed. He told us that if you do away with the special franchise the ordinary director or business man can get elected in the ordinary way.  I do not think on this occasion the Deputy is well informed.  Being a business man, he knows that there are in the city a very large number of businesses&mdash;in fact the major <Col N="839" /> portion of businesses&mdash;which are limited liability companies.  Will he show me how any one of these limited liability companies gets a vote or any return whatever for the taxes it pays?</P>

      <P>Will he show me how the individual members of any company have got a return for the taxation paid by the company, except that an individual director holds a property qualification in the city, irrespective of the taxes paid by the company, and pays rates to the city? In those circumstances that director gets the privilege of franchise as an individual ratepayer, but not as the director of a company.  I challenge Deputy Lemass to give me any instance of a limited liability company that gets any representation in return for the taxation which it pays.  Guinness's, the largest ratepayers in Dublin to-day, do not get a single vote in return for the immense volume of taxation they pay.</P>

      <P>The firm of Jacob, another large ratepayer, does not get a single vote for the large volume of taxes it pays.  Is it fair that those who pay the large volume of rates in our city should, by reason of the fact that they are limited liability companies, be disfranchised?  That is what the whole thing amounts to. It is a difficulty which the Minister has met in this particular way.  In other countries it has been met in different ways.  In the North of Ireland it has been met.  Every country feels that this taxation should get representation in some form.  This is the particular form in which the Minister hopes to give it representation. In other places representation is given.  Does the Deputy argue, and do those with him argue, that these companies are to be taxed, <Col N="840" /> they are to pay the larger portion of the taxation in the city, but that they must get no representation whatsoever?  That would seem to be his line of thought.</P>
      <P>Let us be fair in this matter. Every country has endeavoured to give representation, and why should this country, in which we are trying to deal equitably between the different classes, disfranchise its large ratepayers?  Why should it say to them: &ldquo;If you will move your works across the Border you will get representation there, but if you remain in the Free State we will give you no representation&rdquo;?  That is a poor policy, and it is poor encouragement to business men.  The whole thing is a poor, miserable, wretched idea, and I hope the House will be no party to taking a large volume of taxation from business people and giving them no representation whatsoever in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass remarked that there would be a free vote of the House on this matter, and he would appeal to the rank and file to exercise their judgment on this amendment.  I stand for business representation.  I think it is right and wise.  I have been associated with a public body for some years. I was chairman of it for four years. I am aware of the help given by business men to local councils, and I know their ability.  I think it would be a great loss to public councils if business men, men of responsibility and men with a stake in the country, were denied representation.  I would like to see business men on local boards, because of my knowledge of their ability in managing the affairs of a council.  They have been most helpful; they understand the business throughly.  They give very valuable time, and they give the benefit of their years of experience and training in managing the affairs of the councils.  In listening to Deputy Davin and to his remarks on slum owners and the owners of slum property, the conviction was forced on me that Deputy Davin really does not know what he is talking about. I cannot understand how the Deputy <Col N="841" /> can attack the owners of property in which the working classes live, the very classes who send Deputy Davin into this House to plead their cause. What really constitutes a slum area? It is just this&mdash;that the houses have become old and in the course of years have fallen into dilapidation. Their value in the market is very little.  What is wrong suppose a man like myself becomes the owner of this property, keeps it in repair and collects the rent from the ordinary humble workers?  I do not know anything very mean or bad in that any more than it is for me to collect rent from villas or other property which I have.  I do not call this property slum property, I call it tenement property.</P>
      <P>There is this other aspect in this case&mdash;Deputy Davin seems to think that there is something degrading in owning such property.  He seems to forget that these houses were built for habitation, and he also forgets that we in the Corporation here have a body set up to see that these houses are kept in proper repair, that they have proper sanitation and that everything about them is in accordance with the bye-laws of the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why Deputy Davin should say that the owner of this property is not a fit person to be included in this register passes my judgment.  I do not understand why there is a set made on people who own this property.  The property is not valuable.  On the market its value is very little.  I have known such property being put up for sale and the highest bid that could be got for it was a price of three years' purchase.  I am also satisfied that if any man owning this property goes to a bank and tries to raise money on mortgage on it he will be refused.  Now, according to Deputy Davin if these slum owners are making such a huge profit, and if they are such tyrants towards the working classes in extorting such rents from them, surely <Col N="842" /> then this property should be a gold mine to the owners.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As in my opening remarks, I would say that it would be very bad for local government administration if business men are to be turned down and not get their proper representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we are all entitled to vote on this matter how we choose, and probably what is more important to express our own reasons for so doing.  Quite frankly I am not concerned with the democratic principle which is supposed to be involved in whether or not certain people should get votes due to property qualifications.  The fact that there is a property qualification at all is in practically all cases to some extent a denial of that principle as a pure principle of politics. I can quite see that a good case could be put up even on democratic grounds for saying that in the case of people who are large employers of labour and who have large interests in the city and pay a very considerable portion of the rates, if the machinery which did exist did not in practice provide them with an opportunity to be represented, that such machinery should be provided.  I see no difficulty on democratic grounds in defending an expedient such as might be necessary to enable that to be done, if thereby it will be shown that the people who are for any reason in the world entitled to representation are not given that representation. <Col N="843" /> If people are, owing to any formalism in relation to democracy, prevented from enjoying democratic rights, I personally would regard myself as a better democrat in interfering with those forms than in upholding them.  Therefore it is not for that reason that I am personally opposed to this section.  I am opposed to it on the ground that it is not necessary.</P>
      <P>I think it was Huxley who said that Spenser's definition of a tragedy would be deduction killed by fact. Now, deduction in this particular instance is killed by fact.  We have not these facilities in the city of Cork.  We have not this special register not these special provisions for these people.  We have all the evils which the present system is supposed to possess, and yet in fact these very people for whom representation is proposed to be provided now are not excluded from representation at present.  The House knows that they are not.  We have 21 members in the Cork Borough Council.  There are three organised parties in Cork who have machinery for getting in contact in the ordinary way with the voters.  There is the Labour Party, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The whole of those three organised parties if the theory worked out instead of fact &mdash;parties who had access to the voters&mdash;should have swept that election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these three bodies, a body which calls itself a Business Party put up candidates.  The Independents, who had no organisation of that kind, but who depended upon whatever individual knowledge the individual electors had of them as individuals to get elected, put up candidates.  What was the result? Out of 21 seats Fianna Fáil got three, the Labour Party got two, and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party got three.  All these organisations, as far as I know, got seven or eight seats on the council.  The whole of the rest of the seats were left open to business men and Independents. Each of the Independents and the <Col N="844" /> business men depended on his own individuality.  Having nothing but his own individuality, as many of them were elected as were elected by Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil, and the Labour Party altogether.</P>
    <P>It does not look as if on that basis any man who had personality, and who had individuality, that any man who was without the advantages of an organisation behind him was subject to any hardship.  The Business Party carried seven seats.  These are the very people who have not got this vote which it is now sought specially to give them under this section.  As far as I know, three of these business men are directors of limited liability companies who, Deputy Good says, have no chance whatever of being represented in a council.</P>

      <P>I can give you the names of the three managing directors, three very prominent directors anyway, of three limited companies, three men who are associated in the minds of the people of Cork with those companies.  Deputy Good can have any little shade of difference he likes in suggesting that they were elected under their own names and not as directors.  They were elected due to the fact that they were known to be what they were functioning as, or that they were in contact with the people with whom they were in contact or because they occupied the position which they did occupy.  In exactly the same way, I believe, in the City of Dublin responsible business men will be able to make that contact with the electorate, and will, if they deserve it, have that amount of confidence of the electorate which will enable them, without any of those privileges, to be elected to that council.  Remember this Bill and the evils which are going to remain in it, I mean to the extent to which it is not amended, is a Dublin version of the Cork Act.  Our actual experience under the Cork Act was that the provision of this special franchise is absolutely unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> Now the suggestion is that we should provide a franchise which, in addition to those who would be elected of the particular calibre under the ordinary representation, will give them a special representation. The suggestion is that there is some special virtue, some special decency in relation to the administration of public affairs by people of this kind.  There is not.  It is all nonsense.  I am a member of the Cork Harbour Board, which at one time did consist entirely of these very nice people.  It has now been corrupted by democracy.  Some very ordinary people, even more ordinary than myself, are now members of that body, but there are officials in that body who have had experience of the administration of that body when it was constituted of the two different qualities of human beings. I went to one of these very experienced officials and I asked him what difference he had noticed in the administration of the Board since it had been corrupted by these democratic elements.  He said that the difference was that now if it were a job it was a 30/- job, and before, if it were a job, it was a job well worth while.</P>
    <P>There is not any special virtue, there is not any special patriotism, there is not any special honesty in any particular class of the community over another, and the suggestion that there is is certainly not based upon any experience which anyone can have in relation to the old Dublin Corporation, and the House knows it.  The House knows of land reclaimed in the City of Dublin when very much nicer people had charge of it than the recent Dublin Corporation, and they know the definition of the difference of the administration which was given by that responsible official of the Cork Harbour Board was true, that while under a board corrupted by democracy you may have occasionally little jobs, under the old grand jury system, under the old really first-class, hand-picked people the jobs might not be so many, but they were a lot better worth while.</P>
    <P>If it is shown as the result of the <Col N="846" /> experience of an Act out of which this special provision is cut that elements in this State which are entitled to representation, even though they be moneyed elements, do not get representation, due to the cutting out of this provision, then I for one will unhesitatingly say that that is a defect.  I will unhesitatingly be in favour of providing machinery which will enable due representation to be given to every element of the population, but on the face of our actual experience of the administration of this Act in Cork without the provision for special facilities, I say there is no necessity whatever on any democratic principle or any principle of fairness to provide special representation for those whom our experience has shown can already get a great deal more representation than they are entitled to, a great deal more representation than our experience has shown they are capable of efficiently and honestly using.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flinn speaks of deductions being killed by facts and things like that.  I would like to refer to an expression of the native mind: &ldquo;Ná creid gach ní a chloiseann tú mar is minic go dtógtar brí na bréige as&rdquo; (&ldquo;Do not understand everything you hear because it is many a lie a deduction makes&rdquo;).  I think we might go further in this case and say: &ldquo;Do not understand everything you see because it is many a lie a deduction makes, and if you see business men on the Cork Municipal Council do not understand that the people who are responsible for paying rates in Cork are getting the just representation they are entitled to.&rdquo;  Deputy Flinn knows that it is a fact that Senator Dowdall, a member of the Oireachtas who is a very prominent Cork citizen and who helps to keep the life blood of Cork flowing by keeping a business going there, was not eligible either to be a voter or a member of the Cork Council under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to look at Cork and see that there are business men on the Council.  We say we can discuss Cork and we can discuss the position <Col N="847" /> of Cork at some other time, but we are asking Deputies to say whether the basis of the local government franchise being the occupation of rateable property, that is, the responsibility for paying rates, that those who occupy premises for business purposes are to be denied a voice in respect of the rates that they pay.</P>

      <P>I was asked by Deputy Lemass why one system for the Dáil and why another for local government.  I may ask him that question, too.  All human experience apparently would dictate that it ought to be the same, but the human experience that has been responsible for the growth of our institutions has made things very definitely different.  You have an adult suffrage for representation in Parliament. Representation on local government bodies is based on the fact that you pay rates.  There is one blot on the situation as we see it at present and we are rectifying that blot in the matter of the city. We are giving representation to persons who occupy premises for business purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say &mdash;he has not yet given any explanation&mdash;why there is one system for the city and another for the coastal borough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on to that.  I pointed out, taking the old city for which we have the particulars, that the premises occupied for business purposes bore half the total valuation approximately of the city.  You have also the fact very much in mind that people have been recently discussing the area over which Dublin City should extend, and that people carry on business in the city and live outside it.  In the case of the City of Dublin, as well as having their ratepaying capacity unrepresented in the Council, you have to a very large extent persons carrying on business in the city and living <Col N="848" /> outside it.  They have not even the ordinary local government franchise. The institution of this in the city is a beginning.  In the case of the coastal borough I have no information that would show me that the amount of unrepresented rated property is anything like the proportion of the total rated property in the city.  I am fairly clear that the extent to which persons occupying premises for business purposes in the borough live outside the borough is probably very different from the extent to which persons occupying business premises in the city live outside the city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I am talking in general terms.  I would probably suggest that there is a bigger chance that a publican in the coastal borough is living over his publichouse than that a publican in the city is living over his publichouse. I think Deputies will understand from the nature of the coastal borough that the percentage of premises that are occupied for business purposes is not at all the same proportion of the total rated premises that it is in the city.  The extent to which people who are rated in that particular way live outside the area is not so great either.  I have in mind the fact that the system has not been extended to other county boroughs yet, such as Cork or Limerick.  Dublin City in this particular matter is in a special position.  I would apply the system forthwith to Cork.  I was very glad to hear from a prominent representative of Cork City that the non-application of this to Cork City at the present moment is not, in his opinion, doing any very great injustice to the city.  The kind of suggestion that is running through many of the speeches here is that the business community are a class of people who want to cut the throats <Col N="849" /> of the people generally, or, at any rate, to rob anything they can get from them.</P>

      <P>May I correct one misapprehension? The Minister thinks that because people do not happen to have property in the city they cannot be elected as representatives. In at least two cases in Cork, at the last election, business candidates were put up who would not have had the qualification if property had not been transferred to them ad hoe for the purpose of enabling them to stand.  That property was transferred. They did stand, and they were elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty. The fact that business people have property gives them an opportunity to do things of that kind which people who have not property are not able to do.  I do suggest in all fairness to the House if it was proved that business men could not get representation there might be a case for this thing, but in face of the actual facts and actual experience you are simply using a steam-hammer to crack a nut.  You are trying to work some artificial machinery for something which experience has shown that machinery is absolutely unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal experience is that there is absolutely no necessity for a qualification register. If Dublin has not been represented by business men within the definition that suits the Minister, it is because the business men, to my mind, confine their activities to their own <Col N="851" /> interests and have no sense of community service.  There is not a borough in Ireland where business men have nominated candidates that they have not got reasonable representation for the numbers of their class.  Deputy O'Connell's speech, to my mind, has been the greatest speech for the rejection of this clause that has been delivered in the House.  He admitted that he had personal experience of the capabilities of business men on public boards of which he was Chairman, that they have got their representation at the present moment on a privileged local government register.  They actually get greater representation than they are entitled to.  It is not a democratic register.  In Cork borough at the present moment more than half the council are business men.  You have a total vote of 13 at least nominally outside political parties.</P>
      <P>Again I would like to ask the Minister from what direction came the demand for this commercial register.  Has there ever been a public demand for it?  Has the demand been private?</P>

      <P>Accepting that it is inspiration from himself or his Department, <Col N="852" /> he is placing all his faith in the ability of business men to administer. He must know that the local government register at present will give them in any borough one-third representation.  To give them now a qualified register is quite inconsistent with the fact that while bringing in their brains he will deny them power to administer.  The two facts are inconsistent.  The brains are simply to be an ornament. Where is authority vested in the public representatives of the future Dublin Corporation that will necessitate any intelligence?  The principal reason underlying it is&mdash;no matter what the business man may say in private&mdash;that he will be there only to retain full dictatorship and authority for somebody nominated as Manager under this Bill.  That is the only reason that has prompted the Minister to bring in this commercial register.  It will bring in this class of people who are definitely against public elections in Dublin for the city governors and who want to get that government through the Local Government Department. They are prepared to participate in the farce for the purpose of carrying out the ideas of the Minister.  There has been no case stated where business men showed any anxiety to get representation and where it was denied to them in any borough.  I defy a man who has experience in public administration to point to one borough where business men have not alone been represented, but have always controlled a majority on the council.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the eloquent and moving appeal of Deputy Good, and in view of the statement made by the President earlier and the very emphatic statement of the Minister that this is an inspiration and that it was not asked for by anybody, I would put it to Deputy Good that the deputation <Col N="853" /> which went from the Chamber of Commerce did not ask for it.  I take the Minister's word for that. If Deputy Good feels so strongly now on this matter why did he not put it up to the Minister through that deputation?  There is more involved in it than giving votes to limited liability companies.  There is the question of special representatives on the council.  It is not a question solely, as was the burden of Deputy Good's speech, that a limited company as a company wanted representation.  Personally, I am not so strongly opposed to giving a company the right to vote as I am to this special class of people whom you are putting on the council. Evidently Deputy Good and those for whom he speaks did not see the necessity for special commercial members on the council.  This is a new provision which is an inspiration of the Government, according to the Minister.  It was never suggested by anybody, but it comes now at the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour.</P>

      <P>Even Deputy Good, who might be expected to have some inspiration in that direction, did not think of it when making representations to the Minister. In regard to the special register, I think we ought to have more information as to its practicability.  We have not, however, had anything in that line up to the present.  How is it going to be framed?  What is the machinery for framing it?  Has the Minister made any estimate of the number of people who will come on the register?  It seems to me that it will be very large.  The Minister has not answered Deputy Davin's question as to why a man living over a publichouse in the city will get at least two, and may get half a dozen, votes whereas a man living over his publichouse in the borough will only get one vote.  How is this register going to be framed.  I do not see anything in the Bill about making regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to have something, even an estimate, showing the possible number on the commercial register.  It seems to me that the number will be very large, especially if it is based on the principle laid down here to the effect that any business man with a valuation of £20 can claim to be put on that register.  We ought to hear something from the Minister, not alone as to why limited companies should get a special power to vote but as to why there should be these five special members of the council. We have had very little argument directed to that question so far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>It seems to me that the Minister's argument in support of the commercial register is narrowed down to this, that unless such register is instituted, business men will not be eligible for election to the council unless they are also residing within the council area.  What the Minister is anxious to provide is that a director of a company with premises in Dublin should be eligible for election, even though he resides in the county of Dublin or, in fact, in any other part of Ireland.  That particular purpose of the Minister could be served by introducing a section to the effect that sub-section (5) of Section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1898, shall not apply to the election of the Dublin borough council.  He has already provided that that sub-section will not apply to elections held on the commercial register.  If the only purpose the Minister wants to serve is to ensure that a company director, no matter where residing, will be eligible, he can fulfil it without forcing this provision into the Bill, a provision which on his own admission nobody wants and nobody asked for.</P>

It would not give you in the council, business men such as you have in Cork where they formed themselves into a Businessmen's Party.  Deputies have stated that any business men they met in politics were a failure.  We hope that under this system we will be able to get men with business training who will not be failures, the type of man who will not take on the work of joining political parties, of facing the electors or of doing political work of that kind, but who will be prepared to come in on the kind of franchise which we are giving to the commercial community.  We hope to get a type of man who will be prepared to come in on that kind of franchise without reference to politics and without keeping his eye on the electors, while giving the benefit of his business experience to the discharge of the work of the city.</P>

      <P>If this Bill were not one setting up a managerial system, if it were a Bill restoring the old Corporation under somewhat different conditions, I could quite understand the Minister getting a brain-wave or an inspiration about a commercial register, but the primary object of the Bill as it stands is to set up the managerial system in Dublin, to reproduce the Cork situation in Dublin, while the manager would have supreme control to decorate him with a few electoral representatives.  That is the effect of the Bill as it stands.  It may go through in a different form as the Minister has seen the folly of his ways in different sections.  If it was for any other purpose but to set up a managerial system, I would think there might be some reason to introduce the super-business men whom the Minister has in mind to lend a hand in the control of the affairs of the city, but as matters stand we have a separate Local Government Register, the qualification for a vote being a property qualification.  That qualification is now going to be increased by setting apart a certain number of representatives on another qualification&mdash;on <Col N="856" /> a valuation basis, giving up to six votes to one voter.  All this, to my mind, is a perfectly futile performance. The Minister has not stated what numbers are likely to be on the new Register.  He has not stated what the Register is likely to cost to compile.  He has given us no idea as to whether it is even worth while, having regard to the cost of compiling the new Register whether it is not taking a sledge-hammer to kill a fly.  He has not proved that if business men go up for election in the City of Dublin they would not be returned.  In fact, what this section says is that the Minister himself is convinced that proportional representation, as at present carried out, is a failure.  If proportional representation is in operation in this country at the moment, if it has been the success which all exponents of the present system of proportional representation say it has, and if it is so perfect that it gives every section of the community perfect representation according to their numerical strength, what is the necessity for superimposing upon that system of proportional representation, this dual voting capacity?</P>
      <P>I cannot see for the life of me what use it is, and I think the inspiration the Minister got in introducing this commercial register was for the purpose of keeping the minds of people off the fact that when they were elected, whether on the Local Government Register or on the new commercial register, and when you got all the Labour representatives, business men and professional men together, that practically they had no business on the council and that the Manager would do everything.  That is the condition of affairs as the Bill stands.  I do not think any case has been made for the new register, and I think the House would be well advised not to try to experiment in that way until such time as there will be a guarantee that people, after they are elected, will have control of affairs, without being ordered by a Manager who will be the servant of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connor, who is a representative of County Dublin, has given his blessing to this section of the Bill.  He has done so after the Minister has given as his main reason for the introduction of the clause, the fact that the business man who has a monied interest in the city and who does not reside in the city, should be given a share of responsibility for the good government of the city.  It is a fact that many large business men, who are directors or chairmen of business concerns in the city, do not live in the city.  It is a fact&mdash;and I challenge Deputy O'Connor to dispute it&mdash;that many men who own publichouses, drapery houses and other business houses in Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey live in places like Foxrock, Bray or Greystones.  For the same reason why should not the Minister say that the same principle of voting should be adopted for the coastal borough?  Ten or fifteen years ago when I knew General Mulcahy, who is now the Minister, I looked upon him as a good nationalist with a democratic outlook.  Unless the Minister has turned his coat inside out several times and to such an extent that he does not now recognise the lining of it from the cloth he will withdraw this abnoxious section from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the Bill inasmuch as it provides for a special register for what are called business men.  I think the Bill is very wise in that.  Dublin is largely a non-industrial city, and I think it should be our aim in all legislation to encourage industry to come to this country.  I believe you will encourage industry or induce people to set up industries in Dublin by giving them a reasonable voice in controlling the affairs of the city and in the matter of controlling the taxation of the city.  There is expressed here a great anxiety for democracy.  I would like to know what is the average Deputy's idea of democracy, especially on the Labour and Fianna Fáil benches. Somehow at the back of my head I think their fondness for democracy <Col N="858" /> is for that section of the community that is the more easily gulled and the more easily deceived.  In Cork, where there is a lot of native shrewdness, there is a reaction against politicians of every kind.  I am rather glad to see that, and I think that explains the failure of the politicians to control the Council in Cork.  I hope, though I am not so sanguine that the same may happen here, and that the few additional members that this special register provides for, if they cannot exactly control the council they will have some salutary influence on it, if only for the reasons I have stated, of encouraging the establishment of industries. What industries in England and everywhere else are groaning under at present is high taxation. De-rating was introduced in England. What was the justification for de-rating?  Simply that industries might get a chance of continuing or of being established, and for that reason, as I say, underlying the provision in this Bill, I think that provision is very well worthy of support, and that Labour members especially ought to support it, because it is only by co-operation between capital and labour that we are going to get on in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hennessy said that we are going to encourage industry and that somebody is going to come in here and start an industry with £40,000 or £50,000 because he is going to get a place on the decorated benches alluded to by Deputy O'Hanlon.  If the Deputy thinks business men are going to be so easily gulled as that, I can see any amount of business coming into the City of Dublin.  I do not see what business men want in this decorative establishment at all.  They are going to get no business to do there.  If they go there they will quickly realise what the Cork business men have realised.  The Cork business men have condemned the working of this system in Cork.  It has been <Col N="859" /> condemned by the Cork business men who have been returned to figure as a decoration or as a camouflage for the dictatorship exercised by Commissioner Monahan.  I do not know that any business man will consider it worth his while or allow himself to be used as a smoke screen for the dictatorship that is going to be exercised here.  I think the Cork Corporation, for instance, were very ill-advised to allow themselves to be used as a smoke screen for the dictatorship that exists there and to touch the thing at all.  If the Minister and his Department wish to establish a dictatorship, such as exists in Cork, in every city here, I think the proper thing to do would be to prevent by every means in our power these corporations from being formed and from functioning.  If there is to be a dictatorship, let it be a clear and open one and not working under the smoke screen of an ornamental corporation. That is what exists at present in Cork and what the Minister is introducing not alone into the corporation under this new system that he is establishing, but into every public body in the country.  I do not know whether he claims responsibility for the idea himself, but I am prepared to give him the responsibility for it.  I do not think his Department is responsible; I think it is the Minister himself.  I think it is that peculiar kink in his disposition that has been working all the time&mdash; at one period for the good of Ireland, but since 1922 to the detriment of Ireland&mdash;trying to undo what good he ever did.</P>

      <P>I always listen with great attention to any contribution made in this House by Deputy Dr. Hennessy, but I fail to see what encouragement there is in this Bill to induce business men to enter the proposed Dublin Corporation.  The reasons why the business men should not enter the Corporation, if this Bill is passed, have been stressed by Deputy French and others, and I am not going to waste time in repeating them.  I certainly believe that if this Bill had no other effect&mdash;it may be <Col N="860" /> intended to have this effect&mdash;it will bring at least one medical doctor into it, which I think would be most appropriate, because it would certainly need a medical man to administer the pill so well compounded by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing an inspiration which reminds me, at any rate, that it was once said there are flashes struck at midnight.  In the Cimmerian darkness of the Minister's mind this bright thought flashed, and, inspiration with the Minister is so rare a thing, that he became embarrassed and did not know what he should do with it, so he stuck it into this Bill.  Ill-considered and ill-digested as it is, we are discussing the Minister's inspiration. What is the purpose that his inspiration is to serve?  To give, I understand, representation to the business element in the city.  So far as I can gather from Deputy Good's speech, he wished to imply that the business elements which he desired should be represented were mainly the manufacturing interests.  The effect of this proviso will be to give some representation admittedly to the manufacturing interests, a representation which, I think, is unnecessary, but which, if such representation were necessary, would be inadequate in the manner in which the Minister proposes to provide it.  It will give, at any rate, a much greater representation to those who are not manufacturers in the city, to those who are merely distributors of goods manufactured abroad.  Deputy Good painted to us a pathetic picture of Guinness's and Jacobs', who, he said, though they give a considerable amount of employment, are not represented in the city's government. If they are not represented as entities, or as corporate bodies we have to remember that every one of their employees who lives here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>May I point out to Deputy Good that this franchise is not going to be based upon the amount of employment that these manufacturers give, but upon the valuation of the premises which they occupy, and that there is a very definite limit placed on the number of votes which they are to be given even on the commercial register.  Let us take Messrs.  Guinness.  I am told they employ at least 3,000 persons. They will have six votes.  But Montague Burton, who employs, certainly not 3,000&mdash;I doubt if he employs six persons in Grafton Street&mdash;is to have the same number of votes as Messrs. Guinness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Minister's justification and Deputy Good's justification for this is that they are going to give this privileged franchise to those who give employment. Montague Burton will get six votes.  There are other concerns in the city that employ many more people than Montague Burton, but they will not even get three votes under the special register.  Apart from that, as experience has shown in the case of Cork, the provision of this special register in order to secure that the manufacturing and business interests will be adequately represented on the council is wholly unnecessary.  I have been a member of one public body, and I have a very intimate knowledge of the position of another important council in this county.  Deputy Batt O'Connor has been a member of a public body and so is Deputy Good, and in every case I can say the business community was adequately represented.  They had not a majority, but they were adequately represented, and, as Deputy Good said in the case of Pembroke, the council's administration was efficient and economic, though the business community had not a majority on that body, at least for some years past, but they had adequate representation. It is only necessary that they should have adequate representation, and it is not right that they <Col N="862" /> should have anything more than adequate representation.  It is certainly not right that there should be a device inserted in this Bill, and inserted in the constitution of the municipality to ensure that certain privileged people are to be railroaded into the Corporation, for that is what is at the back of this.  I do not know that the Minister is so concerned about this commercial register, but the fact is that certain special groups are to be elected on the basis of that register and thrust into the council over the heads of the people.  That particular group and that interest have already, as I said, adequate representation.  Every election in this country has proved that.  The records of the public bodies themselves prove it.  The Dublin Corporation was for a long time controlled by what is known as the business interest in the city.</P>

      <P>By, I suppose, the biggest business in the city.  I am perfectly certain the President would not get up and assert that the business element in the old Dublin Corporation were the only elements that approached civic problems with a sense of civic duty and responsibility. When Deputy Flinn was speaking Deputy Good interjected the remark which, I think, indicated rather a confused idea as to what this commercial register and special representation was going to achieve. Deputy Flinn pointed out that at least three members on the existing Cork Corporation were directors of limited liability companies, and Deputy Good said that they did not sit there as representatives of limited liability companies.  If that meant anything it meant this, that each member of a limited liability company should be entitled to have its own particular representative on the Corporation.</P>

      <P>It has that in virtue of the fact that most of the members of the staff, responsible officials, have the interests of the company at heart as well as the interests of the city, and when they come to cast their votes will bear in mind their responsibility to those who employ them, and to the company which they direct.  They are represented, therefore, in that indirect way, just as the members of a householder's family that have a sort of an indirect representation on the Corporation in virtue of the fact that the person who cast the vote has his own particular responsibility to his business and his family.  When a member of a staff of a company, say a responsible person in a managerial position, casts his vote, I am perfectly certain he does not exclude from his mind the effect of that vote upon the fortunes of the company with which he is associated.</P>

Should it have any more representation in the City Council or in the government of the community than those who are actual living entities in the community.  I think the Minister has put the case in a nutshell. Should a corporation, a soulless thing, have any special representation that a living child with a human soul has not?  That goes to the basis of the whole matter.</P>

We say they are represented through the votes of the householder, and that the companies are represented through the votes of their employees, directors and shareholders, and, therefore, are not entitled to any further representation in the affairs of the city.  That is the argument, and I think it is a perfectly logical argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Rational, perhaps, is the better phrase.  Logical is often unreasonable, so shall we say rational, which the Minister very seldom is.  What sort of representation are Guinness and Jacob's to get.  There are to be about 13,000 on the commercial register, so that the kind of representation which Guinness and Jacob's will have will be six votes out of 13,000.  They are to have a voting right in one-five-hundredth part of one of the commercial members of the Corporation.  And that, according to Deputy Good, is going to remove all the disability that Guinness's and Jacob's at present suffer under, and to give them an adequate voice in the affairs of the city.  I think that if the interests of Guinness's are such that a vested interest in one-500th part of a commercial elector is going to give them an adequate voice in the affairs of the city, then I think we must find some other way of giving them representation rather than that proposed in the Bill.  That is the inspiration of the Minister, which Deputy Good has so chivalrously defended, but it does not meet the purpose, and I <Col N="865" /> repeat again I do not think there is anything to be served by this clause. To my mind the only thing it will do will be to railroad four or five individuals who fear to be contaminated by contact with ordinary electors into the council.  So far as the companies are concerned, they are already adequately represented through the votes of shareholders and their employees, and, therefore, I do not think that this section should be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>While having a great deal of sympathy with the point of view put forward, still in view of the fact that a great change has taken place in the country in the last few years, I think it would be unwise to set up two different registers. The suggestion seems to be put forward here that the ordinary workman has not sufficient intelligence in his own interest to vote for the right type of person.  I think that is a wrong impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience, as far as public bodies in the constituency which I represent are concerned, is that the majority of the members of these bodies are business men, and that to a great extent these men are elected by the votes of the ordinary working classes.  I myself in season and out of season have always advocated the policy of having business men on public boards.  I believe in business men for the simple reason that they have experience in the handling of their own affairs, experience which would be useful when handling public affairs, especially in regard to finances.  My chief objection to this section is that this special register would keep business men away from intercourse with the ordinary type of man.  I am keen on seeing that <Col N="866" /> that should not be so.  I am anxious that business men should mix with the ordinary people and exchange views with them in order to secure that co-operation between employers and employees which will be to their own mutual advantage.  It is for that reason that I believe it would be unwise to set up this separate register.</P>
    <P>Again, I am of opinion that the best way to secure defeat in getting elected to a public board is to stand as a Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil or Labour Party candidate.  My experience in the recent local elections in the County Louth is that Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil candidates were sure to be defeated.  It was the men who stood as Independent candidates were sure of being elected.  Therefore, I submit there is no necessity for this provision.  The ordinary people of this country have got common sense and they have cut away from the old shibboleths and from the old policy and custom of electing men on political tickets.  The people know that the economic position of the country requires that men elected on public boards should know how to transact the business. As far as my experience goes&mdash;and it is a fairly typical experience throughout the country&mdash;the ordinary type of elector will not vote for anybody now unless he is convinced that that candidate is going to carry out his public duties in an efficient manner.  I sympathise with the views put forward by those who have spoken in favour of the section, but I think it would be a very unwise course to adopt this principle at this juncture.</P>
    <P>I believe that even without this special register the citizens of Dublin, if given an opportunity, will elect men to the Corporation who will be an honour to themselves and be worthy of the confidence reposed in them.  Besides that, there is the fact that the managerial system is to be brought into operation.  Under the managerial system it does not matter so much what the personnel of the Corporation will be.  The <Col N="867" /> chief duties will be entrusted to the care of the Manager and, if the Minister is fortunate enough to secure an efficient Manager, then the work of the Corporation will be very light. I cannot see why this special register should be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter brought forward by Deputy Good and it was in connection with Guinness's. He states that Guinness's, notwithstanding the fact that it gives great employment, would be entitled to, at most under a special franchise, six votes.  It has been said that Guinness's employ 3,000 men. If those employees have any interest in the firm in which they work it means that that firm has in reality 3,000 votes.  The chairman of any company will naturally cast his vote in accordance with his conscience and with due deference to the material well-being of the firm which he controls.  They say what is typical of the chairman or manager of a company is also typical of the men who work for the concern.  The 3,000 men who work for Guinness's will naturally, when casting their votes, have before their minds what they are to do and they will not vote for any candidate who will do anything inimical to the interests they are concerned with.  For that reason the fears expressed here are groundless.</P>
    <P>My chief objection to this is that there has been a great tendency in the country lately for Chambers of Commerce and commercial organisations to put themselves upon a sort of pedestal, so to speak, and to whine behind closed doors that this thing or that thing is wrong.  Why <Col N="868" /> do not these men come out into the open and trust the workingmen and women in this country?  My experience of any business men who did that is that they were always sure of election.  In the principal town of Louth they have always elected men of business capacity.  There is no such thing as politics in local elections, as far as my experience goes, during the last five or six years.  I am glad that condition of affairs exists.  I can assure Deputy Good that the people of the Free State will not elect any man on a political ticket in future unless he has good characteristics to advance his claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very hard on the three big Parties here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that without any hesitation.  What is true of local elections would be also true if there were a general election held in the morning.  If good independent men would but present themselves for election I am sure a large number of them would be returned to the Dáil. I am willing to submit that opinion to the people of the country in the morning, if necessary.  While I sympathise with the views put forward by those who support the register, I must say that I do not think there is any necessity for it.  There has been a great change all over the country during the last four or five years, and the ordinary people have intelligence enough to vote for the right man.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 19, lines 24 and 25, to delete the words &ldquo;Town Clerk&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;City Manager.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on Amendment 54.  When it appeared that the position of one city manager in the city was more or less acceptable, it appeared more satisfactory to combine the position of Town Clerk with the position of City Manager in order to make more clear and secure that the City Manager would be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and the chief executive officer for the Council in so far as he dealt with the reserved functions of the Council. In the case of the city we were in the happy position that we had as Town Clerk a gentleman with very considerable experience in the city borough, a man who was qualified and fitted for the position, and whose services and capacity during the last few years under the Commissioners have been very favourably commented on, and who may, with safety, be entrusted with the position of City Manager.  So that on the personal side we are in the position that we can safely recommend to the House that the present Town Clerk of the City of Dublin be City Manager under the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain statutory responsibilities assigned to the person of the Town Clerk himself, and it is desirable that there would not be a position in which you would have a City Manager responsible for the whole work of the Corporation and for the discipline and supervision of <Col N="877" /> the staff, and that there would be individual members of the staff who would have statutory responsibility that in no way related to his responsibility. By making the Town Clerk the chief executive officer of the Council we avoid the possibility of any clash of responsibility as between the Town Clerk and the City Manager.  Under the old system the Town Clerk was a very highly-paid official, and was, in fact, the chief executive officer of the Council, while not having the particular type of responsibility that the City Manager will now have.  Under the new circumstances with the city managed by a Manager there will not be the same necessity for the same highly-paid official that the Town Clerk, of necessity, had to be, so that we will secure better efficiency, better control and less danger of friction or confusion in the matter of carrying out the responsibilities of the City Manager and the staff generally by merging the two offices. There will not be the same necessity to have such a highly-paid official in the position of Town Clerk, in the position, say, of head of the secretariat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the other amendments that are on the Paper dealing with this particular matter, we are prepared to accept this amendment as it stands.  When the other amendments dealing with other aspects of this matter come up we will have something to say.  We agree that it would be an unwise and bad procedure to have two officials of the kind, a City Manager and a Town Clerk, having in view the fact, as the Minister has just stated, that there are certain statutory duties imposed upon the Town Clerk which would, if he were continued as such, in view of the proposition to have a City Manager, give him a certain position of authority in certain acts for which he would not be subject to the chief executive officer who would be in future.  I take it, the City Manager.  That would be an anomaly and would not make for harmony, good work and efficiency. Therefore, from this point of view, <Col N="878" /> subject to the other amendments expressing our views, we accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>At any rate, if the person who occupies that position is an official of the Corporation, then the City Manager will be responsible for seeing that the work is properly carried out, in so far as it is a subordinate of his who is responsible for carrying out the work.

    <P>(1)  Whenever a vacancy (in this Act referred to as a casual vacancy) shall occur in the membership of the Council by reason of the death, resignation, disqualification, or non-acceptance of office of a member thereof, such vacancy shall be filled by the <Col N="884" /> Council as soon as conveniently may be after the occurrence thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who is elected by the Council to fill a casual vacancy shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns, or becomes disqualified or he refuses to accept office, hold office as a member of the Council for the residue then unexpired of the term for which the member whose death, resignation, disqualification, or non-acceptance of office occasioned the vacancy would have held office if he had not died, resigned, become disqualified, or refused to accept office.</P>

      <P>This amendment is proposed owing to the indefinite nature of the provision which provides that a casual vacancy caused by the death, resignation, disqualification or non-acceptance of office of a member may be filled immediately.  I realise that it might not always be possible to fill it at the next quarterly meeting. It seems to me that there should not be any long delay in filling a casual vacancy of that kind. If the Minister would put in &ldquo;at the next, or next following quarterly meeting&rdquo; it would mean that there would be some definite limit of time in which the vacancy should be filled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1), page 24, a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The disposition (otherwise than by demise for a term not exceeding one year) under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Acts, 1840 to 1888, of lands, tenements and hereditaments belonging to the Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes that one of the reserved functions of the Council shall be the disposition otherwise than by demise for a term not exceeding one year of certain property of the Corporation.  The effect will be to make the letting of the city estate a reserved function of the Corporation.  I think that it will meet to a large extent the point made about the necessity of putting <Col N="889" /> the Council into the position in certain cases of having control of the leases of city property.  On the general position in regard to the Manager, these amendments are intended to make it more explicit that the Council has complete control over policy, and they are also intended to fit in with the arrangement by which under the reserved functions they are given complete control for the making of rates and the borrowing of money.  Under the subsections in Section 49 they are given power to pass a resolution asking for additional reserved functions, and the Minister, with or without inquiry, can issue an order setting out the additional reserved functions and duties of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, under amendment 89, that the Council may &ldquo;if and whenever it thinks fit, make regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in regard to the reception and examination of all or any particular class or classes of tenders for the supply of goods and for the execution of work, or any other thing for which the Corporation may lawfully have invited the submission of tenders,&rdquo; the regulations made under this section to be subject to the approval of the Minister.  That deals with tenders when received, but it does not interfere with the Manager's powers of entering into a contract.  Amendment 103 links in with the idea that Deputies put forward when they said that the Council had not power to carry out certain works which they wanted. Amendment 103 enables the Council to call upon the Manager to provide the necessary plans, specifications and general information that will enable them to make up their minds when they require certain classes of work carried out.  It enables them to go into such matters beforehand and it will put them in the position, having required the Manager to provide for that particular work in the estimates, to have everything arranged by the time the estimates require to be considered.  In the case of borrowing, they will have the necessary information upon <Col N="890" /> which they can arrange to borrow for work which they, taking the initiative themselves in the matter, consider should be carried out.</P>
    <P>Linked in with that provision are amendments 129 and 130.  Deputies will remember that it was complained that the Council could not amend the estimates in any way they wanted.  This amendment makes it clear that they can put things into the estimates or take things out of the estimates and generally make the estimates, as finally accepted, the basis of striking the rates and make them what the Council require they should be.  It will be seen, too, that the estimates are required to be in the hands of the Council for fourteen days.  I had in mind that I should change that fourteen days to not less than 21 days so as to give more time to the Council to consider the estimates when in their hands, and I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Amendment 101 is intended to give power to the Council in connection with any specific matter which they have considered in a certain way, to order the Manager to carry out something which they require to be carried out.  Deputies will see that it is hedged around with provisions requiring certain notices, requiring that it should be passed by a certain majority, and that after discussions with the Manager the Council can require the Manager to carry out a certain thing which they require to be done.  It provides that an order like that cannot refer to a class generally, but simply refer to one particular act.  I think these amendments go a certain way towards improving the explicit position of the Council in respect to the Manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I would like to suggest to the Minister.  That is in reference to the question of transferring the powers of control to the Council.  That requires the authority of two-thirds of the members of the Council voting for the motion.  I would like the <Col N="891" /> Minister to examine that, because my experience of it is that it is an impossibility.  If the future Corporation of Dublin has a membership of 35, that provision means that you must have 24 members of the Council present and voting for your motion.  Taking it that a reasonably good attendance would be 28 or 29, that provision means that you must carry the motion by 24 votes out of the 28 or 29 present.  I would like the Minister to examine the matter from that point of view.  If it meant that you should have two-thirds of the members of the Council who were present at the meeting there could be no real objection, but the proposal that you must get two-thirds of all the members of the Council voting for a particular motion is a practical impossibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and indicate, first of all, our satisfaction that the Minister is moving thus far from his original position and improving the Bill, in our opinion, by so doing. Secondly, to indicate various points in which I think it is still possible for the Minister to improve the Bill, even within the limits of the scheme which he is prepared to sanction. There are certain additional reserved powers which are proposed to be given to the Council.  We can discuss these on the Report Stage.  I should like to press on the Minister the point of view mentioned by Deputy Flinn in relation to the extension of the powers of the Council. It is undesirable that the machinery should be so rigid as to be practically incapable of being worked.  The provision that you must get two-thirds of the members of the Council before a resolution asking for the extension of the powers can be passed makes the machinery unworkable. It is probable that in a council of thirty-five there will always be a few members sick, and they are ruled out.  Their absence increases the difficulty of getting the resolution passed.  If the Minister would be prepared to amend the Bill and to make it two-thirds of those present and voting at the meeting, it would ease the situation.  The procedure to be adopted in extending the powers of the Council is a very formal one.  Notice has to be given to the Manager, and a formal copy of the resolution has to be sent to each member of the Council.  Every member of the Council who is anxious to vote for or against it is given adequate notice and opportunity of doing so.  If, when all these formalities have been complied with, certain members of the Council abstain from attendance, their abstention will be either due to physical inability to be there or else to the fact that that is the only manner in which they can express their <Col N="893" /> attitude in relation to the resolution &mdash;an attitude of indifference.</P>
      <P>The actual passing of the resolution does not secure the increased powers to the Council.  It only secures that the resolution will be forwarded to the Minister.  He can grant these powers or he can set up an inquiry.  If there is no real case in the view of the Minister, for giving the increased powers the Council will not get them.  But, if there is a real case, then it is desirable that the wishes of the vast majority of the Council should be capable of being brought easily to the Minister's notice.  The same applies to the proposed new section before Section 54. That is amendment 111, which deals with a requisition by the Council that a particular thing should be done by the Minister.  The proposal there is that one half of the members of the Council must vote for the resolution asking that a particular thing be done.  It may often happen that the particular thing that the Council wants done will be a matter of urgency. If the meeting of the Council was held during the holiday period or during a period when influenza was prevalent it might be very difficult to get one-half of the members present at the meeting, much less one-half of the members prepared to vote for the resolution. Again, there is a certain formality which must be followed. Notice must be sent to the members and everybody concerned must know that the particular resolution will be under discussion at the meeting.  In view of that fact, one-half of those present and voting should be adequate to ensure that the Manager would be required to do the particular thing which the Council wants to have done.  In view of the restrictions with which the Minister has hedged round this particular power of the Council, it is undesirable that accidental causes might make it impossible for the Council to carry out the function which has been given to it in that proposed new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposal concerning the reception and examination of tenders, the Minister has undoubtedly improved upon the original Bill, but he has not, in our <Col N="894" /> opinion, gone sufficiently far because there is a very strong case to be made in support of the contention that the Council should have control of contracts.  In considering the matter, Deputies should not merely think of contracts of a small nature. The contracts that the Manager may be dealing with may involve several thousands of pounds and, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of pounds, and as a prominent man in the city put it to me, no matter how honest the City Manager may be the fact that he has the awarding of contracts of great magnitude in his own hands will create a general suspicion that undesirable influences are at work in determining his decision.</P>
    <P>I agree that if the Council makes regulations necessitating the reception and examination of the tenders in public it will work out so that the Manager will be practically compelled to accept the tender which the Council consider should be accepted.  But I should like to see the Council provided with the formal power of deciding that in all contracts involving, say, more than £250, which has been suggested by Deputy Byrne, the Council should have the final determining voice.  In that proposed new Section 54 there is another matter to which the Minister should give consideration.  It is provided in the last sentence that any resolution purporting to be passed by the Council under this scheme which contravenes this sub-section shall be void and have no effect.  That is the sub-section which deals with the passing of a resolution relating to the general powers of the Manager or to the control of staff.  The Council is definitely prohibited from passing such a resolution. There may be border-line cases.  It is possible to imagine a resolution which the Council would urge related to a specific thing, but which the Manager would contend dealt with the general exercise of his powers.  If such a dispute arose between the Manager and the Council, who is to determine the issue? Is there a possibility there that the Council and the Manager would be involved in a legal dispute?  That <Col N="895" /> paragraph visualises the Council passing a resolution directing the Manager to do a thing which the Manager will refuse to do, on the ground that the resolution is in contravention of the sub-section.  Would it be possible for the Council to take legal proceedings against the Manager to compel him to do the particular thing which the Council wants him to do, or should not there be some machinery set up to decide in a disputed case who is right, even if the machinery which the Minister thought of was the usual refuge of the administrator, that the matter should be referred to the Minister? No doubt, that is the solution the Minister would think of, but it is better than having no machinery at all for solving the issue.</P>
    <P>The other points which arise in this connection can be dealt with on the Report Stage, when we see the sections in relation to the Bill as a whole.  I think, however, that we can congratulate the Minister on having gone so far, and express the hope that we can persuade him to go a bit further.  My own view, as expressed in the amendment which stands in my name, is that the procedure which the Minister should have adopted was to have decided that certain specified powers, functions and duties will be exercised by the Manager and that all other powers, functions and duties will be exercised by the Council.  If that had been done, I believe that the objections to this Bill would be much less formidable than they are.</P>
    <P>This particular method which the Minister adopted of giving reserved powers to the Council, and all other powers to the Manager, caused most of the misunderstandings and most of the opposition to this Bill.  The procedure should be to give reserved powers to the Manager, particularly the powers of controlling staff and controlling and executing contracts, and the other functions that gave rise either to corruption or a suspicion of corruption in the past.  If those were reserved to the Manager, and all the other powers given to the <Col N="896" /> Council, unless the Council themselves chose to delegate them to the Manager, the Bill would be much better in principle than it is.</P>
    <P>It is probably impossible effectively to amend the Bill to ensure that that could be done, although we can have a discussion on the principle when the Bill again comes before us, and these amendments are moved.  Before that I would like the Minister to consider the advisability of extending the reserved powers of the Council to include the various items in the different amendments. The Minister expressed his intention that the Council should exercise complete control over the legislative functions of the Corporation, and that the Manager's duty should be confined to administrative functions.  But the Minister cannot possibly argue that administration covers such decisions as those mentioned in amendment 68&mdash;the making, maintaining, and revoking of decisions concerning the nature, extent and cost of capital undertakings. He cannot argue that administration covers other matters mentioned therein, as the letting of houses and the decision as to whether they should be let at a weekly or other tenancy, or sold on the hire-purchase system; the question of whether entrance to the service of the Corporation should be by appointment or by competitive examination; the question as to whether preference should be given to Irish goods in the making of contracts; the question as to whether legal proceedings should be initiated or defended; the question whether trade union disputes should be fought ought or settled; and the other matters mentioned in the various amendments in the name of Deputy Byrne and myself and other Deputies.  All these are questions of policy and not of administration, and if the Minister is anxious that legislative powers should be reserved to the Council, then I think he will be forced to extend the reserved powers of the Council so that they can exercise jurisdiction in these matters.</P>
    <P>We approve of the managerial <Col N="897" /> system.  Probably if it was clearer in the Bill that the Manager was definitely subordinate to the Council appointed, paid by, and liable to be dismissed by the Council, we would be prepared to give the Manager a much wider sphere of operation than we would be prepared to give him while his position is as dubious as it is under the Bill.  But on the general principle that there should be a clear division between legislative and administrative functions of the Corporation there appears to be agreement between us.  The only question at issue is whether particular functions are legislative or administrative, and I think there can be no doubt that we are right as to the matter mentioned in the amendment. I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of accepting our views in relation to these matters before the Bill comes forward again on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I press the Minister to accept the spirit of what Deputy Lemass urged.  He referred again to the two-third majority.  I think there is in the same class the question of one month's notice.  That, to my mind, is altogether unnecessary.  A notice served on a member of the Council is quite easily forgotten in one month.  A month's notice does not serve any useful purpose.  I think a fortnight's notice or twelve days' notice should be sufficient to any member to make up his mind on a particular motion.  Again, it would be a good thing if it were possible at this stage to have even the powers of the elected representatives more clearly defined in the Bill.  I have some experience of a smaller measure and, like Deputy Lemass, I agree that the second venture of the Minister has been far more liberal than his first.  I think he deserves to be congratulated on that.  I think the Minister could, at this stage, define the powers more clearly.  The Minister is aware that in regard to a similar Bill that passed through this House amendments have been put forward.  The amendments asked for by the Cork Corporation would only alter the Bill in a very slight way, but they are not the last word.  The difficulty in attempting to alter that Bill was almost insurmountable.  To put down in words the exact intention <Col N="899" /> becomes almost impossible, even for a lawyer.  It should not be assumed that the amendments sought in the Cork Bill are anything like the last word in the opinion of those who voted for them.  I again suggest that the relations between the Manager and the Council should be more clearly defined.  It would be far easier for those who will have the worry and trouble of administering this Act if we had a clearer definition. It would be almost impossible, after the rates meeting, for a member of the Borough Council of Cork to stand up and to be strictly in order.  After the rates meeting he has absolutely no function, and anything he might say would be more or less a friendly advice to the Manager or would be simply expressing his opinion that the Manager may adopt or reject at his pleasure. Strictly speaking, after the rates meeting he has no authority to open his mouth.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could have five minutes really to finish this and to reply to some of the points made.  On the general appeal made to further consider these matters with a view to seeing whether I could not completely accept them I say to Deputies to give further consideration to the general position and to look into it again as it is in the Bill and in the amendment.  A judge in Chicago was given a job to decide, and he did decide, that a wife had the right to slide down the bannisters. Some of the powers that the Cork Council are looking for seem to be in the same kind of category. They are looking for things that they have already.  I appreciate the remarks of Deputy French when he says that it is terribly hard to put into words what the Cork Council feel they want.  You cannot lay down a certain framework of words and say that that completely suits a City Manager, human, with his temperament and his capacity and all that, and a city council, and one cannot dovetail them into one another in the way in which a mechanic will <Col N="900" /> take two wheels and fit them completely into one another.  You have to give them the framework over which they are to work and the rest is co-operation and administration. I am prepared to go further into these matters and we will see what we have to say to each other on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the attitude of Deputies with regard to the number of the majority under amendment 111.  I think we might be prepared to make it 50 per cent. of the council or two-thirds of the members present at the meeting.  With regard to the point about two-thirds of the members and the month's notice under Section 49, I am prepared to look into that matter and see whether a change may not be made.  That deals with a resolution calling the Council together to consider a very fundamental matter; that is, the passing over to them of reserved functions. Really it ought to be a thing that would require a certain amount of formality and not the kind of thing that ought to arise in a hurry, simply because a particular thing was being dealt with and something must be done at once.  It is a matter that ought to arise out of the general experience of the Council.</P>

      <P>After the Second Reading of this Bill it was sent to a Special Committee.  There it underwent considerable amendment. It was then sent to the draftsman and the draftsman found the Bill was badly drafted and the amendments were not in legal phraseology.  Accordingly he was faced with a difficult situation and it was thought advisable that the easiest way out of the difficult position was to redraft the Bill in the form of amendments to be moved in place of the existing sections of the Bill.  It will therefore be necessary, if the amendments are carried, to delete each section.  There must be a motion to delete the section because the amendments that are proposed here are to take the place of the existing sections with the exception of Sections 7 and 8, which, I <Col N="902" /> think, it will be necessary in the end to move the retention of.  Sections 7 and 8 are the only sections that will not disappear if the amendments, as they appear on the paper, are carried.  Amendment 1 is in the nature of an explanatory or definitive section.  It defines the various phrases in the Bill.  I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before Section 1, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Justice; the word &ldquo;sweepstake&rdquo; means a drawing or distribution of prizes by lot or chance whether with or without reference to the result of a future uncertain event; the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; means and includes any hospital, sanatorium, or other institution which affords medical or surgical treatment; the expression &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; means the council, board, committee or other body having the control and management of the hospital in relation to which the expression is used.</P>
      <P>(2)  This Act applies to every hospital which complies with all the following conditions and to no other hospitals, that is to say, that such hospital&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) is situate in Saorstát Eireann; and</P>
      <P>(b) is in receipt of voluntary subscriptions from the public; and</P>
      <P>(c) affords treatment to members of the public without discrimination, and in particular without discrimination on the ground of religion; and</P>
      <P>(d) reserves, on a monthly average, twenty-five per cent. of its accommodation for indoor patients for the use of patients who do not pay for treatment in such hospital or who pay or on whose behalf is paid not more than ten shillings per week for such treatment; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) is not subject to any provision, whether contained in a <Col N="903" /> statute, charter, regulation or otherwise, debarring persons from election or appointment to positions or any particular position (other than chaplain) on its staff on account of religious belief.</P>

I am not at all sure as to what would be the practical effect of this amendment.  I am rather slow to adopt the principle and I suggest the Dáil ought to be slow to adopt the principle that a hospital founded on a purely religious basis and run on purely religious lines should be deprived of any help under this Bill. I think that principle is wrong no matter what are the practical effects this amendment means to achieve. I suggest that that particular portion be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a practical matter I would like to know how paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 1 could be worked out.  That reserves a certain number of beds for patients who do not pay for treatment in a hospital or on whose behalf is paid not more than 10s. a week for such treatment.  That is the precis of it.  How could that actually be worked out?  What sort of evidence could be produced that that is the rule of the hospital?  How long must that have been in force? How long shall it continue in force? Could a hospital pass a rule that 25 per cent. of its beds are to be reserved for non-paying patients as defined here and that rule be brought into force on the eve of a lottery and cease the moment that lottery is over?  I am asking these questions from the practical working point of view.  How could this be really proved?  Suppose a hospital has got a considerable number of persons who are willing to pay more than that, and that they have not the full quota of persons who are unable to pay more than 10s. a week, are they to keep their beds empty or are they to reserve as a sort of scheme these beds or say &ldquo;We will cut you down for a few weeks&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like before this is put into <Col N="905" /> operation to know how it can be worked or what evidence can be given to the person judging this scheme that the hospital comes within this definition.  I venture to suggest to the Deputy responsible that unless there is a restriction that can be completely worked out it is a mistake to have any restriction.  It seems to me that this is the nature of a restriction that it would be impossible in actual working to carry out.  But if it were possible for Deputies who know how hospitals are carried on and how their books are kept to explain the matter to me, I would be glad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the case presents any difficulty whatever, so far as the hospitals in which I am interested are concerned. They keep details of the number of beds occupied from day to day; they also keep details of the number of beds paid for by the occupants and the amount paid for each bed. Those items are added up at the end of the year and they are able to tell how many beds are occupied entirely free, how many beds for which there was a charge of 7/-, 10/-, a guinea or two guineas, and so on.  If a hospital is not able to show at the end of the year that they are giving free treatment to at least 25 per cent. of their patients or patients who do not pay more than 10/- a week, I do not think that the Minister would be asked to adopt a scheme.</P>

I would like to be clear on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Thrift ought to know that every fortnight <Col N="906" /> there is laid before the Board of a hospital a detailed account of the number of beds occupied.  You cannot set apart certain beds in any hospital and say &ldquo;These are going to be kept for twenty-five per cent. of the cases.&rdquo;  That is not possible.  That may be the wording of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the wording I would like to know how it could be practically worked out unless you knew the period of time.  You would have to lay down that during three or four or five years preceding the passing of this Act one quarter of the cases were patients who were paying under 10/- a week, if that could be done.  Also there is the labour of going through that and it will be very hard to check.  I am not opposed to it.  I know what the Deputy and what the House want is this: that there should be some provision in the Act&mdash;the spirit of the Act should show&mdash;that the hospital is, to a very considerable extent, a charitable hospital. I think that is the view of the House generally and I think it is right that that view should be expressed in the Bill.  But when you come-down to set a definite figure you will, I think, find that it is very hard to prove.  Before a scheme is sanctioned clear proof will have to be given to the Minister for Justice for the time being that the hospital is a charitable hospital really.  He must check these things.  I would suggest to the House that a vague expression would be very much better and much casier to carry out&mdash; that is if you require an expression at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should not be beyond the powers of the House to devise some basis by which we could decide whether a hospital is really doing charitable work or not.  The Minister for Justice has criticised this Bill but he has not put up an alternative.  I think that the alternative of leaving the whole question in the Minister's hands would be really preposterous.  The Minister in the opening stages of this Bill was not at all in favour of it and I do not <Col N="907" /> think that a change of attitude which he has now displayed is sufficiently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;constructive to merit the placing of the whole power in his hands.  Personally I think that Deputy Sir Jas. Craig's section preserves a working basis.  Some such basis will have to be found and if that basis is not quite satisfactory the Minister should now be able to suggest to the House, before he asks for power to interpret the Bill himself, some better average.  This average that has been suggested is the outcome of the work of the Committee which apparently has gone into this whole question.  I feel that there ought to be a definite period in the Bill to preserve the benefits to hospitals that can show that they are definitely doing work for the poorer classes of patients.</P>

If you take a year the inequalities even themselves out and certainly a hospital which does not within the year appropriate one way or the other twenty-five per cent. of its accommodation to non-paying patients could hardly be described as the type of hospital I wish to assist through this Bill.  If it does not keep at least twenty-five per cent. for the very poor who can pay nothing or for those who can pay a little, then it is a profit-making concern and exists for the purpose of presenting a sound balance sheet at the end of the year.</P>

That has been threshed out by the Committee.  The Committee felt they were not prepared to give this help to any hospital that was not giving a very large proportion of its beds to the free treatment of patients.</P>

I would like to point out if this is a limited Bill the more difficult you make it the less effect it will have.  If you put up a scheme that you are going to run sweepstakes on the Derby and if you have the preliminaries so hedged around with difficulties and necessities of proof it is manifest that before the scheme can be ratified you will rather defeat the objects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The delay and the difficulties.  For instance, the books will have to be produced and gone through and all that before there is any proof.  Suppose you start sweepstakes, suppose a scheme is put in to-day and it becomes my duty to see that since Christmas at least twenty-five per cent. of the beds had been occupied by non-paying patients as defined here.  That would be a very long and tedious <Col N="911" /> business and it would be awkward for the hospitals not to have these books while they were being investigated in my Department.  I am looking at this in a practical manner. When a scheme is presented you look at it and see does it come under that definition, because if it does not you are not entitled to pass the scheme.</P>

      <P>I saw difficulties of this kind arising when the Committee was in existence.  I realised that the Committee, having worked fairly hard on the Bill, would like to have another opportunity of going over it before it was presented to the <Col N="913" /> House.  I was told that the Standing Orders of the Committee did not permit of it.  We were told by the Chairman of the Committee, Deputy Doyle, that to make sure that everything would be water-tight he had arranged that the Bill would be submitted to the Minister for Justice, who had kindly promised that he would, so far as the phraseology was concerned, make it water-tight, with the assistance of the Government draughtsman.  If that be so the blame is on the Minister for Justice. Certainly, questions of phraseology and difficulties have arisen that could best be settled in Committee, and unless the matter is very urgent I think the best course to adopt is to re-commit it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any difficulty about the phraseology.  I think the phraseology here is perfect.  After all, the draughtsman simply puts the idea into words.  He does not supply ideas.  If practical difficulties arise, that is not for the draughtsman.  The draughtsman's work is only to translate into appropriate language the ideas that have been supplied to him. This could not be better worded. The practical difficulty it gives rise to is the thing which causes me trouble.  Deputies are much more keen on this Bill than I am, and I think it is rather a pity to put impediments on the working of the Bill.  That is all I got up to point out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that steps should be taken by the Executive Council to frame a scheme of national control which will provide adequate safeguards for the Saorstát milling industry and for the consuming public.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, by way of preface, that this motion was not put down in any insular or Party spirit and I hope that it will be discussed free from Party affiliations or antagonisms and in a manner befitting the seriousness and importance of the economic issues at stake.  I also wish to dissociate myself from anything in the nature of stunt propaganda, and I want to say, in addition, that since the original meeting <Col N="915" /> held in Cork when we discussed the milling position in the Saorstát created by recent developments, I have not attended any public meeting held in the country, because I believe whilst it is necessary on occasion to help to form opinion and to do one's best in the national interests I consider that this motion and everything appertaining to the industry should first of all be discussed and decided here.  I want to make that perfectly clear to everybody in this House, no matter to what Party he owes his affiliations. I am not going to take up the attitude of some publicists and others who ask for subvention or State intervention in a great many industries. Neither am I going to approach the subject by suggesting that the Government were either indifferent or apathetic.  I have indicated my attitude towards that class of propaganda.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government are actuated by none but the highest and best motives in their attitude towards this industry.  I also believe that they are just as much concerned as I am, as this Party is, and as any Deputy is, about the welfare of the community.  Having said that, I hope that no Deputy will charge me, or those associated with me, with any kind of attempt to make any Party propaganda out of the misfortunes of our country.  At the same time we must admit that Governments, like all human institutions, are only fallible.  I believe and hope that as a result of this debate there will be a better understanding and appreciation of the flour-milling position in the Saorstát than apparently exists at present.  I want also to say that I am not opposed to the financing of Irish enterprise by foreign capital when Irish capitalists have neither the enterprise nor the pluck to finance Irish concerns.  I prefer foreign capital to no capital at all.  I prefer to see employment created by good and careful business management, no matter where the capital comes from, than to see bad trade and consequent unemployment brought about by bad business <Col N="916" /> methods and bad trade organisation.</P>
    <P>It must be known to every Deputy who takes an interest in the economic position of our country, having particular reference to the matter with which I am now dealing in my motion, that an association, known as the Millers' Mutual Association, has been recently formed in Britain. The big millers there gave twenty-four hours' notice to the small millers, and now 95 per cent. of English millers are in this mutual association and their industry is rationalised.  Under rationalisation output is fixed.  There is a quota mentioned to which every individual mill or miller subscribes and the output is named and fairly well defined. There is no question whatever that price is not regulated.  Under the scheme of rationalisation that obtains to-day in Britain price is not regulated.  It must also be known to most Deputies that the position of the milling industry in Britain is that it can in four and a half days manufacture all the flour necessary for consumption in Britain and that the output for the remaining one and a half days is used for dumping into this country.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to describe the process known as dumping, and to say what it spells for the economic conditions in this country. I am aware also that in order to tackle this process of dumping it is necessary to tackle a very serious problem, and one that would require very careful handling.  I do not think that I would serve any useful purpose at the moment by dilating at any great length on the process of dumping, though I have given it some thought.  The Free State has been kept open for many years as a dumping ground for the over-production of flour in Britain.  There is still, as I pointed out, over-production of flour in Britain, and that over-production is dumped here for the consumption of Irish people to the detriment of our home milling industry.  Recent happenings in the Irish milling industry have resulted in the taking over by an outside or foreign combine of one of the most important flour-milling institutions <Col N="917" /> in this country, namely, that of Messrs.  Bannatyne, representing about thirty per cent. of the flour trade of the Saorstát.  Thirty per cent. of a basic industry of this State has suddenly passed into the hands of a foreign combine, and there are well-founded rumours at the moment that another very important British firm is throwing longing eyes at this part of the world with a view to annexing or appropriating another Irish milling interest.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any statute to prevent any owner, once he has acquired property in this country, to get rid or dispose of it as he so desires.  He may, for instance, proceed to dismantle property he has purchased.  There is a variety of ways in which he can dispose of that property to his own advantage and to the disadvantage of the people of the country.  No control, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in a recent statement, such, he said, as would be necessary in time of war, would be of any use, because then, of course, the mills would have disappeared and, if they had not disappeared, the raw material would be in the hands of foreigners.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated quite recently that it should be clearly understood that no agreement arrived at privately within the industry could in any way diminish either the rights or duties of the Government to take such measures for safeguarding the public interest as future developments might warrant. I want to suggest that these developments have arrived and are undoubtedly present.  I hope that as a result of the discussion that will ensue on this motion the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and any other Minister who has any responsibility in the matter, will be stirred into some kind of activity that will result at least in a stop being put to further ramifications of this basic industry on the part of outside capitalists or financiers.  Attempts have been made by many people outside, and by some Deputies, to confuse the whole issue and to draw a red herring across the track of this very <Col N="918" /> important matter.  For instance, it has been suggested that it is a question of tariffs.  Tariffs have no relation whatever to the present crisis that has arisen.</P>
    <P>It is my own opinion, an opinion, perhaps, that is shared by very many members of all Parties in the House, that if we had a tariff on flour it would have been still more attractive for this combine or these combines to come in here and extend their activities in this country.  It is my own conviction, at any rate, and I think that conviction is shared by very many, that the proposition would be still more attractive.  I have certain doubts which I am not going to express here, as to the bona fides and the genuineness of some&mdash; and I say some advisedly&mdash;Irish millers in looking for a tariff at the time they did.  Attempts have also been made to obscure this issue by the opponents of State control, State control in any form or of any kind. That is a position or an attitude of mind that I could very well understand in a reactionary Government, in something that would correspond to the old Tory Party in England, but which is an attitude I cannot reconcile with the present Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <P>I want to be allowed to develop my argument without interference from anybody.  I want to say that it seems rather out of place, to say the least of it, for any member of the Government Party to suggest, that whilst there is contained in this motion a suggestion of State control, that because of that inherent fault in their view, this motion should not be passed.  Let us see what was the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture dealing with a subject that is most akin to the one we are now discussing. The Minister for Agriculture, speaking on the Creamery Act in the Dáil on 10th July, 1928, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There are some foreign concerns which are very much concerned with the competition they have to meet from the creameries we have <Col N="919" /> purchased.  They would be delighted to come in and start factories here for the production of milk products.  They have very big amounts of money behind them and they would be glad to come in here in the hope of wiping out the co-operative system and taking over part of the industry from the farmers again.  We are determined to stop that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are determined to stop that!&rdquo; These are the words of the Minister, not the words of an ordinary Labour Deputy in this Dáil. Continuing, he said: &ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, those foreign concerns which were so much concerned with the competition which they had to meet from the creameries which the Government had purchased&mdash;&ldquo;are nibbling at it at the moment, but under Section 13 no factory dealing with milk products can be set up without the consent of the Department.&rdquo; Here we have a form of State control.  Here we have it clearly indicated by the Government that under Section 13 no factory dealing with milk products can be set up without the consent of the Department.  Let me suggest for one moment that instead of milk products you insert the word &ldquo;flour.&rdquo; It would then read: &ldquo;Under section so and so, no factory dealing with flour or flour products can be set up without the consent of the Department.&rdquo; You would then subscribe to more than three-fourths of what is contained in my motion.</P>
    <P>I think I have indicated fairly clearly my attitude in relation to what would have occurred if the flour tariff had been put on.  At least, I do not think it would have made a very great difference.  It might have hastened the process and the evolution of the finances in relation to milling which we are now considering.  I have shown, I think, that if the process is to go on that these financiers could buy up and having bought up, could dismantle every mill in the Free State and compel us to pay the highest possible price or any price they wish <Col N="920" /> to fix for their imported flour.  Let us consider for a moment what are the operations of these combines across Channel.  This problem is not our problem solely or only.  There is even at the present moment a good deal of conflict of economic opinion and thought in Great Britain as to the operations of these trusts and combines.  I think it is hardly necessary to mention the name of the firm concerned in this case; it is well known, and, for the sake of Parliamentary practice and procedure, I do not intend to mention the name, as far as I possibly can, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I have here a cutting from the &ldquo;Yorkshire Post&rdquo; which dealt with the operations of one of these big combines across Channel and the very damaging effect which they had on the city of York.  Let us call the firm Messrs. X.  The cutting is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The decision of Messrs. X. to close their Hungate mills would be a serious blow to York, where for many years flour-milling has been the second most important industry in the city, employing about 1,000 men.  It will not only mean a considerable addition to the ranks of the unemployed, but will deprive the city of a considerable revenue in rates, as the mills are among the most extensive business premises in the city.  They include a large grain silo erected some years ago which at the time was reported to have a capacity of six months' food supply for York.  It will also mean a big loss in revenue to the Ouse navigation authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is one of the effects of the acquisition by this big combine of an improved flour mill in the city of York.  When one takes into consideration&mdash;although some people will not agree with me&mdash;that there must be some little patriotism left in Englishmen, though a group of financiers will make their patriotism subservient to their greed for still more money and still more exploitation of the people, can we as Irishmen expect that this group will treat <Col N="921" /> us in anything but the same manner? Can we even hope that if they once get a hold of something beyond the 30 per cent., possibly 60 per cent., and more than likely 100 per cent. of our milling industry, they are going to have any qualms of conscience about closing down the whole of them?  I have no delusions on the matter&mdash;none whatever.  I mentioned the Creameries Act.  In that case we know that the Government ousted foreign capital.  They took over the business of Lovell and Christmas and Cleeves&mdash;Cleeves were of course cut out.  Here we had no question of discouraging foreign capital.  I may not possibly express the view of 40 per cent. of this Dáil, but in my view the flour industry is of more concern to this country than the butter industry&mdash; far more important as a national asset.  The people could live without butter, but they could not live without bread.  The Minister for Finance speaking in the Dáil, on 7th March last, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be quite possible to devise a system of taxation which would make it unprofitable for any foreign corporation to acquire or establish industries here. It would be possible, after a transition interval, to oblige companies, if they were to continue to have the privilege of incorporation in this country, to have 51 per cent. of their shareholders resident and domiciled here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have a half promise, if you like, that something can be done, that it is possible within our Constitution. We will not come into conflict with any constitutional law or right.  But we have that right to demand of any foreign corporation, company, or combine operating here, that 51 per cent. of their shareholders shall be resident or domiciled in this country.  I want to know from the Minister is he prepared to avail of the rights which this House has conferred upon him and which, I believe, the Irish people expect that he will exercise.</P>
    <P>There was an analogy which the Minister for Finance made that was <Col N="922" /> rather an unhappy one.  In the course of his statement on the same day, I think, he said that if they were to take stringent steps to discourage the employment of foreign capital they would shut the door on any possibility of another such concern as Ford's being established here.  He did not think we ought to do that. I really feel that I am one of the very few who have a little regard for the Minister for Finance and his ability.  But I am really surprised that the Minister should attempt to draw any such analogy between a firm such as Ford's and little industries. I do not want to belittle these little industries, but small industries, such as cigarette factories, sweet factories, and tobacco factories, give employment to a number of young people for a certain period, but when they reach 18 or 20 years of age they are thrown on the unemployed market.  The idea of comparing firms such as these with an enterprise like Fords, which gives employment to between 5,000 and 7,000 persons at good wages, and which circulated at least one million of money in this country during the last year or so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of the Minister for Finance making such a comparison is certainly beyond me. I have suggested that a basic industry like the flour industry should be treated in the same way as the creamery industry was treated, and I also want to suggest very seriously to Deputies in every Party that we should carefully distinguish between the entrance of a foreign firm to set up an entirely new industry and an invasion to smash an existing industry. It is certainly, I think, conceded on all hands that this is an age of trusts and combines, and that the day of the small miller is gone. But I think it is up, primarily to the Government, but also to us, as <Col N="923" /> the representatives of the people, to choose between allowing the flour milling industry to be controlled by and from Liverpool, or by the Government of the Free State.  That is the issue before us at present, and, notwithstanding the fact that there has been a lot of wild talk in the country, and that possibly some of the Government Party may think an attempt was being made to stampede them, or certain of their members, into doing things, because of a certain agitation, the Government should be big enough and great enough to seize this opportunity and do the right thing towards this basic industry of ours.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the position in so far as it relates to the number of mills working in this country.  There are in the Free State to-day, as far as my information goes, 43 milling plants, of which 14 are silent; two were burned.  These are the figures which I got and I believe they are nearly correct&mdash;I do not want any small point to be made, for instance, that there are only 13 silent when I said 14.  I am giving the figures which I got from authoritative sources, and they leave 27 plants working, some at half time, some at quarter time and so on.  But I do know that a great number&mdash;what the exact number is I cannot at the moment say&mdash;are not working to their full capacity and have not worked to their full capacity for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mills working to-day produce roughly one million sacks of flour. I understand that to meet the requirements of the Irish people we would have to produce two million sacks of flour.  In other words, the position to-day is: we are producing 50 per cent. of our consumption and we have to rely upon Britain for the other 50 per cent.  If our mills were enabled to work at full capacity, I am not going to suggest at this moment that they could produce all the flour that would be consumed in this country, but they are capable of being developed and, even under existing circumstances, if they get a chance, they are prepared to produce <Col N="924" /> 75 per cent. of the requirements of the people of this country, leaving 25 per cent. of the flour to be imported.</P>
    <P>In asking that the Executive Council should frame a scheme of national control which would provide adequate safeguards for the Irish milling industry and for the consuming public, I want to say that this is not an original idea.  It is not new by any means, for a scheme of this character, perhaps with some variation, is in operation in Spain, Portugal and Switzerland.  Some system approximating to what I have indicated may be also in existence in other countries but I have not heard of it.  I have given this matter some little thought and I have gone to some trouble, by way of research, during the last week or so, but that is the only information that I can glean in relation to precedent anywhere as regards the class or kind of control exercised in other countries.</P>
    <P>I have here some proposals which I understand have been handed to the Department of Industry and Commerce recently.  It is my opinion &mdash;an opinion which I know is shared by very many members of all parties in the Dáil&mdash;that these suggestions would form the basis of a scheme of national control which should engage the attention of the Executive Council. I want also to say that these proposals are not cast iron; they require revision.  They have been submitted in the very best interests of the State and the industry, and they form the genesis or basis of a good, sound and progressive economic policy, peculiarly adapted and suited to the requirements of our country.  The proposals are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A permanent Flour Commission would be established whose members would have an independence something akin to the Currency Commission.  Inasmuch as the members of the Commission will have very drastic powers and highly technical work, it is thought its personnel requires careful consideration. Its objects are so specialised and its task, especially at the commencement, so difficult <Col N="925" /> that we think it must have pretty extensive judicial powers.  The difficulty is to combine expert technical knowledge with the functions of the judiciary.  We (that is, the different merchants and flour millers) are of opinion that the best method is to have a Chairman of the type of Judge O'Brien, Chairman of the Railway Tribunal, who will have the exclusive and final decision on such matters as fixing of prices, the determination of import licences, and the admission to the Register of Importers.  The Chairman's tenure of office should be secure and his salary fixed by legislation.  As to the other nonsalaried members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this should appeal to people with the economy axe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>of the Commission we suggest a representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and three representatives of the Irish flour millers who would represent the three milling districts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every effective flour mill now existing in the Irish Free State, even though silent at present, will be registered and licensed by the Commission, with full particulars of its equipment, power, capacity and ownership.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is amplified somewhat&mdash;I know this will make a very great appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who makes a regular fetish of effectiveness and efficiency&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By effective mill we mean a mill capable of economically producing flour by a certain date.  Its owner will have to provide the capital necessary for re-starting or re-equipping the mill if such is required; he will have to pay the necessary entrance fee and deposit; he will have to accept a quota and carry out his producing obligation before the first revision of quotas, and he will have to sell his flour at an economic price.  In these circumstances, there can be no question whatever of galvanising <Col N="926" /> a moribund mill into life or of subsidising the owner of a really uneconomic mill.  On the contrary, any such mill will by this means be given a final quietus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for efficiency.  The next paragraph states&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Except under the licence of the Commission, the capacity of a flour mill may not be increased nor may any new mill be established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a safeguard for those who want to see more efficiency in the mills.  It will conserve, at least as far as possible, a fair or equitable arrangement by which each area will get a share of the flour production.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission will assign a production quota to each mill, and may periodically revise such quotas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that is done in other countries.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Infringement of the quota by excess or deficit may be controlled by suitable sanctions and forfeits. We think that the periods for reconsidering and revising quotas will, at the beginning, be short, say monthly.  This will provide more secure data; it will also quickly secure the elimination of any mill which is not really effective or economic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that ought to satisfy anybody who worships that fetish, efficiency.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No legally valid transfer of ownership, or shares or quota-right in a flour mill may be effected without the approval of and registration by the Commission. This approval may not be withheld when the effective control and the majority of the shares are in the hands of Irish citizens, resident in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister must have raised some objection some time ago to the terms of that condition, but so far as Irish millers are concerned, I understand they are prepared to substitute something in the following terms&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No transfer of ownership, shares or quota-right in a flour <Col N="927" /> mill will be legally valid until such transfer is registered by the Commission.  In the case of a proposed transfer to non-nationals, or to a corporation whose effective control and the majority of whose shares are not in the hands of Irish resident citizens, it will be the duty of the Commission to make a valuation and to afford Irish nationals a preferential right of purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dealing with imports and prices, the statement says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission will determine and license the importation of flour into the Irish Free State. If the Commission is of opinion that the price of home-milled flour in the Irish Free State is appreciably higher than the economic price of flour of a similar quality in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it may, after due notice to the home millers, license an increase in the amount of imported flour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is proposed to amend that somewhat and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission will prepare and keep a register of flour importers; in doing so it will, as far as possible, recognise the existing importers and will give special facilities to firms or individuals who import flour as raw material for manufacturing products for re-export.  No one except a registered importer may import wheat flour and a registered importer may do so only under licence and under specified conditions as to quantity, category of flour, place of entry, and period of time.  Importation of flour would be licensed in so far as the supplies of home milled flour are inadequate to the country's needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to stress this suggestion to Deputies who may have any lingering doubts in their minds as to what is meant by it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Importation of flour would be licensed in so far as the supplies of home milled flour are inadequate <Col N="928" /> to the country's needs. In all matters relating to registration of importers and licences to import the duly attested decision of the Chairman will be exclusive and final.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think, having regard to the suggested Tribunal or Commission, that that particular suggestion should have a good deal of weight with the Government Party, and indeed with members of every Party in the House.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission may fix a maximum price for any category or categories of flour in any area or areas.  In case any millers in the opinion of the Commission are charging for any category of flour a price exceeding this maximum price, or exceeding the economic price of flour of a similar quality in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, having regard to the national economic gain of having the flour manufactured in the Free State, the Commission may reduce these millers' quotas or may license, generally or locally, an increase in the imports of flour.  In the matters dealt with in this article the decision of the Chairman is to be authoritative and final.  The Commission may regulate the imports of wheat by designating merchants or brokers in specified ports to act as importers for the millers.  Very important powers are assigned to the Chairman in his judicial capacity, to be exercised only after discussion in the Commission, and, if necessary, the hearing of the interested parties. We do this in order to allay any suspicion that the millers themselves are anxious to secure a free hand or to exercise such rights independently of the community. Moreover, the decisions are of such a nature that they could not possibly be fixed by legislative enactment. They can be reached only by executive decision after technical and expert consideration. It would make the scheme quite unworkable if we were to give to a large and ill-defined class of persons the legal right to be <Col N="929" /> registered as importers and to have an assigned percentage quota. One of the objects of the scheme is to encourage the Irish millers to increase their capacity and thus lessen the required imports without, however, interfering in any way with a firm such as that of Messrs, Jacob.  It would not be easy, at least at present, to arrive at a legal definition of what in any area is the fair economic price of flour of a given specification, but we think, especially after a short period of working of the plan and when the mills have secured full output and when the weekly returns have accumulated, the Commission could arrive at a fair working decision on this point.  If the mills are given the home market and their full output, there is no reason why any miller's price should exceed the corresponding price in Great Britain.  And if any miller should attempt to charge more, we desire that the Commission should have power, by price-fixing, quota-restriction or allowance of increased imports to deal with him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are other suggestions:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission may make obligatory on millers the utilisation of home-grown wheat in proportion to the quota of their mills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I appreciate that that opens up a very wide field and would possibly give rise to very long discussion.  It might eventually mean the bringing in of matter which I, personally, do not want to introduce at this juncture. I believe the time will come when we shall have to face up to this whole question of wheat production, but I do not want to bring it in at the moment.  We cannot afford, just at the present time, to be in the position of the man and his wife who started to dispute when the house was burning.  The first duty of that man or woman was to run for the fire brigade.  That is the reason I do not want, at the moment, to stress this question of home-grown wheat.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If flour milling is carried on in conjunction with other activities, <Col N="930" /> such as maize milling or baking as a single company or firm, the regulations concerning ownership and transfer will apply to the conjoint enterprise, but the flour milling business may be formed into a separate company which will then be registered and licensed apart from other enterprises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection, it is stated that the cost is not likely to cause any appreciable increase in the price of flour.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission may make with the millers arrangements for securing an adequate reserve of wheat and flour in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a suggestion which will meet with the acceptance of every member of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission will have such powers of investigation, inspection and control as are necessary for the carrying out of its functions.  The expenses of the Commission will be borne, partly or wholly, by the millers in proportion to their quota.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In opening my statement, I stressed the seriousness of the position. I indicated, I think, in very clear, lucid and understandable language that, as far as I was and as far as I am concerned, I approached this question with a sincere desire to do something practical and constructive for the industry.  I regard the whole situation very seriously.  I regard the question as one of urgent national importance.  I would ask Ministers and Deputies of all sides to treat this matter as a big national issue and not to drag it down to the level of partisan politics.  I deprecate very much any attempt on the part of any Deputy or any party to drag a matter of this kind into the polluted channels of party politics. I think the matter is too serious for that, fraught, as it is, with such consequences for our country.  The flour-milling industry, so far as we in Cork are concerned, is not a great industry.  From the point of view of the employment it gives, it is not a great industry.  In the whole City <Col N="931" /> of Cork, there are not more than a couple of hundred persons engaged in the industry.  I want everybody here to understand that there are other districts in which milling is a far more important industry, from the point of view of capital invested and persons employed, than it is in Cork City.  I mention that fact for two reasons.  I mention it primarily in order to clear the air with regard to insinuations inside and outside this House&mdash;that some persons intend to make a party question of this problem and to reap party advantage. Is there anybody so bereft of common sense, not to talk about patríotism at all&mdash;let us leave that out of the picture at the moment, because I see very little of it at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think I could better emphasise the non-party character&mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;of <Col N="932" /> this question than by supporting the motion of Deputy Anthony.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, as the definition of non-party, the suggestion that party matters can be described adequately and correctly by all parties in this House as &ldquo;the polluted channels of party politics.&rdquo;  If I found myself belonging to a Party and acting with a party that was &ldquo;polluted,&rdquo; I should not belong to such a Party.  As I understand the position, we do differ upon things which we regard as fundamental.  I think the position ought to be that while we differ upon things we must, in the things in which we can, co-operate, and we shall.  That is the meaning, and the only meaning, which I attach to the word &ldquo;non-party&rdquo; in relation to this measure.</P>
      <P>This is a big and a serious question. It is a State question, a consumers' question, and a millers' question.  The State, in my opinion, is bound to regard the position in that order; first, from the point of view of the State, then from the point of view of the consumer, and then only of the miller.  What we have to do is to find some means of reorganising our industry in the face of attack, so that it will be built up into the position of being able completely to mill all the wheat which is used in this country, by an industry internally owned and controlled, and whose efficiency will be expressed in the economic price at which it provides bread and flour to the whole population of the Irish Free State.  What is very hopeful in this matter is that the Irish millers have come frankly to recognise that, in applying to the State to come into control of them to this extent, they are asking the State for a benefit, and they are frankly recognising that the first duty of the State, in conferring upon them that benefit, is to see that benefit shall inure first to the State itself, next to the consumers, and then only to the millers as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very big advance, in the sense that the milling industry has frankly and openly recognised both its responsibilities and its duty to <Col N="933" /> the State, to the consumer, and, above all, to itself in that matter.</P>
    <P>Now, they recognise that, by saying to the Flour Commission which is set up that it shall have as its first duty the safeguarding of the State, and then the safeguarding of the interests of the ordinary consumer in the State.  The chairman, whose tenure of office should be made secure, and who should be immune from outside influence as far as possible, shall be charged directly with the duty of safeguarding the interests of the consumer and the State, and shall be given such necessary overriding power as will enable him effectively to discharge that function.  The representative of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will similarly be in the position of a man representing the interests of the consumer and of the State, while no doubt he will also take a broad view in relation to the interests of the millers.  The miller members on that commission will be there for the purpose of enabling the chairman and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his representative to have that accurate, immediate, and continuous knowledge of the conditions of the industry and of its necessities as will enable them to deal with problems as and when they arise.  The powers which are given to the chairman&mdash;the quota alteration in case a mill does not play the game, does not do its work, and in other ways in the licensing of imports, either as a whole or segregated imports through particular ports into particular areas, and to deal with wrongful differences of price&mdash;do seem to give the necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>We think that it would be possible to set as a standard price in Ireland something approximating to the British price.  The desire is to set it at the British economic price, if possible. That would be the port price. On that would be based the price in other places in Ireland.  It would normally be based upon the port price, plus the cost of transport to a particular place, as the maximum. It is hoped, if and as the port prices will be regulated by the average of the variations of the prices of wheat, <Col N="934" /> that so, too, the internal price in the country will be based upon the average variation of the prices of wheat, plus the cost of getting the wheat in the manufactured form into the hands of the consumer.  The quota has to be based upon the actual capacity of the mills to produce an economic flour.  In other words, if you have a particular mill at the present moment which has been allowed, through slackness of trade and so on, to go out of condition, or which has not modern equipment in the way of conveyers and all the rest of it, or the most modern machinery in the way of milling, it would be up to a mill which demands a certain quota and gets it to say that it would put its mill into such a position that it will mill that quota of flour at an economic rate defined upon some such terms as I have previously mentioned.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that there should be internal ownership of the industry, that is to say, that nationals of this country shall control the whole Irish milling industry.  So long as that principle is conceded, the machinery by which it can be put into operation is a matter which is open for discussion.  A difficulty has been suggested, that some particular man who had a mill in Ireland under some national scheme of this kind, in case he wanted to fall out, might find no Irish buyer.  We think that will not be likely.  We think that perfectly adequate safeguards for him and for the community can be got together in the valuation of his mill, and the offering of that possibly to the reorganised industry as a unit.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there are not many of what you might call considerable importers of flour in Ireland.  You could practically count all of them on the fingers of one hand.  The number is not entirely confined to the importers of British flour, which is very fortunate in this particular case, because it may be necessary that the Commission, if it was faced by the fact that in the case of the mills here the flour which is coming from England itself was being controlled in price <Col N="935" /> for one reason or another, should have an alternative source, such as American flour, and so on, to bring in to break up that combination.  We are satisfied from what we know of the actual people&mdash;I could name them, and they are very few&mdash;that by operating through the existing importers to the extent to which we have to import flour perfectly simple administrative machinery can be put up both to deal with imports and to deal with any variation, limitation or extension of that import for particular purposes at particular times.</P>
    <P>The amount of Irish wheat produced at the present moment is quite negligible.  I do not suppose there is 1½ per cent. available for milling purposes.  There is no actual problem there either technical or financial at the moment.  There is no technical problem at all in relation to the using of Irish flour.  It is a question of putting in the right machinery, and it could be dealt with. The amount available is so small that it does not represent a material problem.  When the amount of Irish wheat is so increased as to represent a problem the machinery for dealing with it is easily constructed.  The whole cost of dealing with this machinery, the whole cost of this Commission, is to be paid entirely out of the Irish milling industry itself and none of it will fall upon the State. Turning now to the fact that we have foreign millers in here, and leaving aside the question of whether or not they should be allowed to remain here, there is at least this point on which I think there could be universal agreement.  Of the total amount of flour used in Ireland 50 per cent. is imported.  We suggest that as a minimum any foreign miller coming in and taking possession of or building an Irish mill shall mill flour out of the imported and not out of the home produced quota.  In other words, the one tolerable condition in which they shall be allowed to operate mills in this country is that by so doing they shall decrease the amount of imported flour and increase the amount of home-produced <Col N="936" /> flour by the amount of plant which they do in fact operate.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have at present in Ireland is due to the fact that Irish milling as a whole is not great, and in the second place it is not so united and organised that it is possible to buy wheat economically. People have been buying wheat for the past couple of years on a falling market.  I want to envisage what has been happening in Ireland throughout the whole of that falling curve when people were buying cargoes which may have to last six weeks.  You will see that whatever point upon the curve they take, 12,000 tons or whatever it is, for distribution in a particular area the price must be held over the whole period of the gap between cargoes. That price must be held above the price which people with shorter period facilities for cargoes would have to pay.  Since Messrs.  Rank have come in&mdash;and I want to say bluntly and brutally, that I do not blame Messrs. Rank or anybody else taking advantage of any facility or law we allow to exist in the country for their benefit&mdash;that position has been aggravated.  They have already begun to buy on port charters in Cork and Limerick.  They will buy wheat upon two port charters for Cork and Limerick, unless, in fact, they decide to shut down the Cork mills, Messrs. Furlong's, which they have bought.  The effect of that will be to increase the periodic time between the buying of cargoes, and to a further extent to tend to increase the price of Irish wheat as delivered to the mill.  The effect of Messrs. Rank coming in is to raise the price of the wheat which is used in all other mills, due to the fact that his quota of consumption is taken out of the cargo.  We are anxious under this scheme of national control that there shall be as wide as possible co-operation in the buying of wheat.</P>
    <P>At the present moment it is impossible practically to buy wheat in cargoes for a good deal of the bakers' bread.  We are using four or five different classes of wheat, perhaps, in making flour.  Where the total consumption and production <Col N="937" /> is so small, and where it is broken up into different sources of supply&mdash;I mean different points of import and so on&mdash;it has been necessary to buy simply and solely parcels of wheat, as they are called, which come into Liverpool and other places at different times.  These parcels come into those countries practically as ballast in ships.  They can be sold very cheaply over there, and they have to be bought here at an extra price, plus the cost of discharge and re-carriage.  That is one of the fundamental difficulties&mdash;to buy wheat for Irish mills as cheaply as for the very big mills with big consumption in England.  That is a difficulty which would be mitigated in the degree in which we get co-operation under national control in the buying of all our wheat supplies through one source.  At present to a certain extent that is done.  The southern mills, for instance, practically buy their wheat co-operatively, that is, brokers buy for the lot and distribute the stuff to the different mills. Our intention is that under this scheme we shall extend that.  If under a scheme of this kind in which different mills had their quota we could get out of a certain amount of bad competition which exists between millers, and even though there were a very great increase in the price of wheat, and there ought not to be any, we should at the same time be able to get as palatable bread and of as good a quality at a lower price than we get at present.</P>
    <P>What is not generally realised is that the best patent flours which we are so proud of consuming here are really offals.  They are really things which at the price which is demanded for them could not be sold in the country of origin.  London, Birkenhead, and its neighbourhood cannot consume at the price at which they are offered their patent flours.  We are the fools who will insist upon eating a particular quality and appearance of flour which the very much richer countries will not eat.  When the mills are under a system of national control in which <Col N="938" /> they can deal with the bakers as a unit, then it will be possible to provide for the people of this country a flour made probably of a lesser number of wheats which will be altogether better for them, quite as palatable and, on an average, very much better than is consumed in London or Paris.  In addition to that, as we reduce the number of wheats which we include in our particular flours, we reduce the problem of importing flour economically.  That is to say, we get ourselves into an area in which we can import larger cargoes more frequently and at more economic prices.</P>
    <P>I come back now to what, in my opinion, would be the driving force of this movement.  It is, in my opinion, of the highest degree of importance that this particular industry should be internally owned and internally controlled.  As long as that industry to any degree is in the possession of the foreigner the position is that of an enemy inside your walls.  Whatever tariff arrangement you make, or whatever other arrangement you make, as long as he is inside your walls you will find it very difficult indeed to maintain your position or to maintain the national point of view.  If the foreigner controls your mills here, it does not matter twopence halfpenny what tariffs you put on.  He can still get over them.  He can still control completely the price at which you are dealing.  And he can subtly and slyly buy and come into control invisibly of an industry which is apparently in your possession.</P>
    <P>There are firms in the City of Dublin at present who have been bought out under tariffs, whose Irish directors do not own one single share of the large number of shares which are in their names.  If we will face the fact that the attack upon this industry has only commenced, and that that attack can be met now without any great difficulty, but will have to be met at a later period over a much larger area in which it is much more strongly entrenched, then I think we might come to an agreement to go ahead now.  I am in a position to say to this House without <Col N="939" /> any hesitation whatever that Bannatyne's, Russell's and Furlong's can be bought out by Irish nationals with Irish capital and for the purpose of forming part of a nationally controlled Irish industry to-morrow, if the Government are prepared to put their support behind that movement, if they are prepared to call together the Irish millers and to say that &ldquo;subject to your entering into a system of national control, in which there shall be absolutely cast-iron and water-tight safeguards for the benefit of the consumer, we will stand behind you in whatever is necessary to get that industry reconstituted as an internally-owned and internally-controlled Irish industry,&rdquo; I believe that can be done to-morrow.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the Irish millers are between the devil and the deep sea.  They have their hands in the lion's mouth, and as in Limerick the other day, as you saw, they do not dare talk out before that lion.  They are afraid of falling between two stools.  It is true that it was the Irish millers who first approached the English mutual millers and asked them to be allowed to come in.  But that was because they saw their position of weakness in the face of an organisation which was prepared, as they believed it was prepared, to use its power to crush them.  To my knowledge within the last few weeks efforts have been made to see whether or not the position could be saved.  But they cannot hang on too long, and unless it is intimated to them with some clearness that the alternative of internal national control by an internally-owned Irish industry is at their disposal, then, as far as I can see for a considerable proportion of them at once, the only alternative is to submit to control from outside.  I personally have no doubt that if the significant portion which will immediately fall into that group is allowed now to fall into that group, in process of time, as and when the opportunity arises, the rest will fall also.  For a time it will be necessary for Messrs. Rank to run Limerick.  It may be necessary for Messrs. Rank <Col N="940" /> to run Limerick intensively.  It may be necessary for them to use it as the spearhead of the lance which they will send wide through the industry in Ireland.  That is what it is for, and what it is being paid for, but when its work is done, when the overheads have been charged up to England, when the price of that flour has been sufficient to widen the area of demand from Rank's and Russell's and Furlong's mills, as they will still be called, or Bannatyne's, as they will still be called, they will have broken down gradually the opposition and strength of the competing Irish millers, and it will be simply at their discretion whether or not they manufacture.  I know and I believe the Government is quite sincere in saying that they think they can force, over a period of years, these mills to keep on producing on any basis they choose. Personally, I do not think they can. If the control and ownership go out of the hands of those over whom the Government themselves have control, then I think they will find the actual machinery in this matter will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have spoken any word to-night, and certainly I have not tried in any portion of this agitation to say one word in any way which would reflect any personal political bias or belief in this matter. I regard this as one of the questions in which to the extent to which we can co-operate, we shall.  I am anxious to see how far we can go forward in this matter together; how long we can keep together, and how effectively we can keep together now in order to see that all the flour in this country is milled by Irish mills internally owned and internally controlled.  It is in the spirit of co-operation, in the spirit of those anxious to work together for the common good that these proposals have been put forward in the first case, and it is in that spirit they have been advocated here to-night.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this motion for several reasons.  I believe it is an unnecessary motion and if the danger which is put up here were an actual danger I believe it could <Col N="941" /> be dealt with in a very much more effective fashion.  The motion is one which is taking up time that this House can ill afford to spare.  The motion is unnecessary because I think it must be clear to the meanest intelligence that were this danger an absolute fact it would be seen and guarded against by the Government. The Government would have the information, and would certainly have the intelligence and the patriotism to grapple with such a danger.  I am not satisfied with the pious aspirations expressed towards making this a non-party motion.  I was not satisfied in Cork, after I had spoken, when a member of the Opposition Party here, in a rather clumsy fashion, unsheathed his claws and tried to drive some of us into a false position.  Not even the indignant remonstrances of his more intelligent associates, when they brought him to heel, could convince me of any sincerity behind this motion.  I am satisfied that the Government will take the necessary steps, when and if such a danger arises, as will guard the national existence of this country effectively. I will vote against the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the most important thing in connection with the future of the milling industry is that the mills should operate here and that employment should be given here.  If the mills actually continue to operate here, to make flour here and to give employment here, the question of who owns the mills, while not by any means negligible, is very definitely of secondary importance.  I said on a previous occasion here that wholesale control of our manufacturing industries by people not citizens of our country and living outside the country, would be a bad thing, but that on the other hand, control of some of our industries by such people is no serious matter, is probably no harm at all.  It is really a question of balance.  If all our industries are to be controlled from outside it means that the industrial initiative in the country will be lost, certain prospects of growth will disappear and a variety of economic ill-results will follow.  On the other hand, the coming in of certain foreign firms here may be a stimulus and it will, at any rate, in many cases lead to speedier development, more immediate development, and perhaps development that would not come at all without the coming in of foreign firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general principle, I think that we should not take drastic action simply because some of our industries may be owned by outside firms.  I think if there were prospects of all industries coming under foreign control, some policy to prevent that taking place would be necessary. I do not see that it is any more necessary or any more important, in the case of the flour-milling industry, that every factory or every mill should be owned by a Saorstát citizen than it is in the case of any other industry.  There are industries which it would be very much more important to take steps to ensure that they were owned by Saorstát citizens than the flour-milling industry. I think that there is no prospect now, and there is never going to be any likelihood, that flour-milling in this country will grow in such <Col N="943" /> a way as to provide a large export trade.  Consequently, we are not in any danger, if mills here are branch mills of a foreign firm, of losing prospects of industrial development that we would have if there were independent mills which might develop a large export market.  In fact, I cannot see, I do not want to see, and I would not like to see, all our flour mills owned from outside.</P>
    <P>Just to get down to the fundamentals of this case, I do not see that even if all our flour mills were owned by outside firms that that would necessarily be in the nature of a national calamity.  I do not see that it would really affect the ordinary citizen.  I do not see that it would have any other effect than the damping down of initiative that does come from having no native at the head of an industry of a particular type, I do not see that the passing of the mills into foreign control involves any danger that would not exist or could not arise with the mills owned by Saorstát citizens.  At present, with Irish mills not up to providing the flour for the whole country, with the necessity for importing flour in existence, it must be clear that the prices charged to the consumer will depend really on English prices if we are to consider only imports from England.</P>
    <P>So long as there is some margin of the citizen's requirements that has to be made up by importation, then the price of all the flour sold in the country is going to be regulated by the price of the imported flour.  If the Irish mills are only able to produce 70 per cent., 80 per cent., or even 90 per cent. of the flour required by the country, and if 10, 20 or 50 per cent. has to be imported, then if the people outside by agreement or of necessity put up their prices, we may take it that the prices charged by the Irish mills will be put up in a corresponding way. Certainly, so long as the Irish mills do not produce or cannot produce all the flour required by the country, if there is a monopoly or a ring or a cartel outside the country, that cartel, monopoly or ring is in fact <Col N="944" /> going to fix the prices charged by the Irish millers, because the Irish mills will simply and naturally and quite properly charge the price they can get.  I think that is an economic fact.  Some people sometimes are reluctant to recognise the other side of it.  When we realise that the price of agricultural produce here depends on the price that can be obtained for the exportable surplus that has to be got rid of, there is no reason for thinking that the attitude of the Saorstát monopoly towards the consumer is going to be different from the attitude of an external monopoly.  I think it is perfectly certain that if the scheme that is recommended here were adopted and implemented by law the price to the consumer here would go up.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of arrangements suggested for keeping the price down, but anybody knows that any of those checks that are suggested will operate slowly and with difficulty, that the atmosphere will be obscured, that it will be difficult for the judge or any person who may have charge of price-fixing or may have responsibility for admitting imports or altering quotas to prevent over-charging, to ascertain what is the price that is actually being charged in Great Britain for a particular grade of flour, and if he has to decide not only what the price charged in Great Britain for a particular grade of flour, but whether or not that is the economic price&mdash;and the phrase the economic price is used&mdash;he will be very slow in coming to his decision.  It will be quite possible for the Irish millers, even if the other authority takes steps, to overcharge for a considerable period before these safeguards can come into operation.  I feel perfectly certain when we have a monopoly, when we have the principle established behind the whole scheme of having all the Irish mills working and the flour all produced at home, that we are going to have, taking it over a period of years, a very definite increase in the price that will be charged to the consumer, and we are going to have this price thrust <Col N="945" /> on the consumer to guard against a danger which we do not know exists, and which, if the danger is real, is a very much less danger than is represented, and which even if it should materialise, in fact and action, is not necessarily going to be of any great consequence to the country.</P>
    <P>I think that before the Irish millers put it up to the Government that the industry should be regulated they ought to make a very big attempt to co-operate to rationalise the industry.  That is, so far as they can do it, they ought to develop a scheme for producing their wheat, which is being talked about, carry it as far as they can possibly do it and try to organise their industry in such a way that wasteful competition will be eliminated, that in fact, instead of rationalisation being carried out by a State Board, rationalisation should be carried out on a voluntary basis by the mills, and that no State action should be taken because simply a clamour is raised; that State action ought to follow the undoubted and indisputable appearance of danger and that it ought to be directed towards avoiding that danger, turning that danger aside at the least possible cost to the consumer. I believe that any proposal such as this is not justified by anything that we can see in the situation at the moment.  I do believe that the situation could be dealt with in other and more effective ways. I believe, if we were driven to it, it would be better to have a low system of tariffs accompanied by some system of discriminatory taxation based on location or form of ownership. I believe that would be far better than this attempt to regulate everything right through and create a monopoly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently we can take from the speech of the Minister that the proposal for the national control of the flour-milling industry which has been under discussion between the Government and representatives of the flour-milling industry has been definitely rejected by the Government.  The Minister, in fact, indicated that in his opinion <Col N="946" /> foreign control of the flour-milling industry is not to be regarded as a calamity at all.  In fact, he seems to have definitely adopted the view previously enunciated in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is not here at present, that foreign control of the flour-milling industry is, in fact, desirable because of the fact that English millers are so much more efficient than any Irish miller could possibly be.  The Minister told us that the most important thing is that the mills should operate here and that the question of who owns the mills is of only secondary importance.</P>
      <P>That argument is undoubtedly very plausible&mdash;in fact, it cannot be contradicted&mdash;but it does indicate that the Minister is looking at this whole question from the wrong end of the telescope.  He believes that the only important question is that mills should exist in this country at the moment.  We can leave, he tells us, the future to look after itself, believing we have in our possession power to deal with any contingency that may arise.  I want to submit to the House that the question of who owns the mills, although of only secondary importance to the question of having mills in existence at all, is of sufficient importance to justify serious attention being given to it by Deputies on the Government Benches, much more serious attention than appears to have been given to it heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that the Irish millers, if they want rationalisation, should rationalise themselves.  I am not at all sure that rationalisation is such a good thing as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and certain other people who have been speaking on this matter believe.  We know that the effect of rationalisation in other countries has been to increase unemployment and not to decrease prices.  This craze for rationalisation appears to be unjustified by results, but there is a case to be made for improving the conditions under which Irish mills operate.  I do not think that the Minister could have been serious when he urged that Irish <Col N="947" /> millers should rationalise themselves. It is not possible for Irish millers, in view of the deficiency in milling capacity, and in view of the competition that they are faced with from a highly organised combine in England, to frame any scheme of rationalisation that would justify itself by results.  The case for national control rests on the fact that it is not possible for Irish mills under existing conditions to rationalise themselves.  It is because Irish millers could not do that that they went to the British Millers' Mutual Organisation and asked them to be let into their rationalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>It is most undesirable that the flour-milling industry of this country should pass out of the hands of Irish citizens.  It would, I think, be a calamity, despite what the Minister says, that the flour-milling industry should pass entirely into foreign control. I think it will be generally recognised that the existence of an international cartel controlling, not merely production of flour in the country, but the importation of flour, could defeat any proposal advanced in this Dáil for the regulation of this industry.  If we are going to permit that position to be created it means that we are definitely surrendering the power of the Dáil to interfere in this industry, the very existence of which is vital for the lives of our people.  The existence of that international cartel controlling our flour-milling industries will mean that the price of bread to the people here will not be dictated by any laws of supply and demand, but by the greed for profit which animates the directors of the cartel, at any particular moment, and nothing that the Minister can do or that can possibly be devised, other than the confiscation of the mills in the country, will suffice to interfere with that programme of internationalisation that has been permitted to develop.  I cannot see that the Minister has, in fact, any power to deal with this situation if it develops along the lines in which it appears to be developing at the moment other than the <Col N="948" /> method of confiscation.  It is very undesirable that the Government should allow a position to be created in which it would have to take such drastic action, for we should recognise that this industry is a key industry. We should recognise that its existence in the country is something which the Government should be anxious to promote, and at this stage, at any rate, indicate our dissatisfaction with any proposal to permit it to pass out of the control of our own citizens.  It may not be necessary that every mill in the Free State should be owned by a Free State citizen, but it is desirable that effective control over the milling policy should be determined by Irishmen and not by outsiders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony made a long speech, but he pointedly refused to deal with one matter that I consider of vital importance in this whole controversy, and that is the relationship that must exist between the flour-milling industry and wheat growing in the country.  I am convinced, no matter what the Minister for Agriculture may say or may believe, that it will ultimately be forced on the Government in power, whether that Government is formed from the Cumann na nGaedheal, the Fianna Fáil, or any other party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the reason I did not want to link up wheat production with this present motion is because I believe that we could go on for hours discussing that.  We had a very long discussion on the findings of the Economic Committee in that connection, and I did not want to drag that in, though I do recognise, and I think I stated that I did recognise, the importance of wheat production in relation to flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Anthony's position, but I maintain that the Government, no matter who composes it, will ultimately be forced into line with the other countries in Europe in relation to this question of the promotion of wheat growing.  When they do devise some means of encouraging wheat <Col N="949" /> manufacture within the country they will find it very desirable to have the flour-milling industry controlled by persons with some interests in the country other than the profits they can make out of it.  This whole question of the establishment and maintenance of an efficient flour-milling industry here is linked up with the question of the development of wheat-growing.  I have been reading in the Press recently of proposals of that sort in England &mdash;the introduction of legislation to compel English millers to mix a certain percentage of English-grown wheat with the foreign wheat milled by them.  We know that there is a peculiar attitude in the minds of the present Executive in relation to this matter.  The Minister for Agriculture went over to Canada and saw the methods adopted for the growing of wheat in that country.  He came back and told us it was impossible to compete with Canada.  In fact there is more wheat grown in Europe, outside Russia, than in Canada, the Argentine and the United States put together.  The Government of the Free State will be forced ultimately into line with the other Governments in Europe in relation to this matter of wheat growing, and then I think they will bitterly regret that the present Government permitted a position to be created in which a good part of the flour-milling industry will have gone into the hands of people who will not be prepared to facilitate them in anything which will not mean additional profits to themselves. The Minister said that so long as the milling capacity here is deficient the price of flour will be fixed by the combine in Britain. That may be partially true.  I believe it is only partially true.  I believe it is possible for the Government to take action which would prevent any undue rise of price here, no matter what the conditions existing in England were.  It has been said this evening by Deputy Anthony, and it was said here on an earlier occasion by the Minister for Finance, that the present position of the flour-milling industry has no relation to the question <Col N="950" /> as to whether a tariff on flour should or should not be imposed. That also is only partially true.  Undoubtedly, if a tariff had been imposed when we asked for it, we would have had a position somewhat similar to the present created earlier.  It would be different from the present in one important particular. The existing flour-milling industry would be sufficiently well equipped and managed to maintain their position against any English controlled mills that might be established. They would be able to maintain their position in consequence of the increased market trade available for them.</P>
      <P>We have the Irish millers going into the Millers' Mutual Association and asking to be let into their rationalisation scheme because they are unable to continue in the situation created for them by the refusal of a tariff.  The best method of protecting the flour-milling industry is not by the imposition of a tariff but by the adoption of some such system of national control as outlined by Professor O'Rahilly or as submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the representatives of the milling industry.  If such a scheme were adopted&mdash;and I have no particular views concerning its details&mdash;it would provide not merely that we would keep the industry here under the control of Irish nationals but also that we would provide a market for Irish mills producing flour efficiently to the full extent of their capacity.  That is what we desire to do, and if that is done there cannot possibly be any undue rise in price, such as the Minister appears to foreshadow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present conditions are allowed to continue, or if the other position I mentioned arises, the complete internationalisation of the industry, a rise in the price will come inevitably and there will be no power other than the drastic action I have indicated in the hands of the Minister to prevent it.  We should nip that development in the bud.  It would be a mistake for the Dáil to allow this position to develop merely because of the assurance of the Minister <Col N="951" /> that in his opinion he can deal with it when it becomes more serious.  I do not believe it.  I believe that he is acting on a false assumption. He is over-estimating the power of a National Government to deal with a highly financed combine if it sets itself out to defeat the wishes of that Government.  It has been proved in European countries that international cartels can defeat the intentions of Governments when they impose tariffs by price-fixing on both sides of a national border.  It will also be proved to be true in relation to the flour industry here, and the only effective way in which the situation can be dealt with is by national control.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, I think, that it is futile to turn to the millers and say, &ldquo;rationalise yourselves.&rdquo;  He knows that they cannot do it, as they are not strong enough.  The deficiency in milling capacity makes it almost impossible, unless the State comes in and gives them assistance and a status which only the State can give.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has, I know, much more pronounced views on this matter than the Minister for Finance. He appears to foreshadow a situation in which, the English millers having come in and the Irish mills having been sold, it will be possible to impose a tariff.  He appears to think that the only reason why a tariff should not be imposed was because there was not a sufficient number of efficient mills in the country and that only efficient millers would exist here after the process of selling out had developed to an extent greater than it has developed.  He appears to think that it would be a good thing if more Irish millers sold out than those that have done so.  In fact he said, if the Irish millers go out of business at the instance of the Millers' Mutual Association, &ldquo;Good luck to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a wrong attitude for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take towards an industry which all the Governments in Europe are trying to promote.  The existence of an efficient flour-milling <Col N="952" /> industry means the existence of wheat and other supplies, ensuring the people's food for a considerable period in the event of a national calamity, such as a general strike in the country of supply, or a blockade or war.  I know that when somebody talks about the necessity of having an efficient flour-milling industry to deal with a war emergency the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture is inclined to laugh.  Both of them seem to think that as we are protected by the British Navy there can be no danger to us in consequence of a war.  The last food situation which we had to face arose out of the general strike in England in 1926, and the Minister knows that when that strike took place there was considerable danger of a bread famine in this country in consequence of the deficient supplies of wheat and flour. That may arise again.  The existence of the flour-milling industry will mean large stocks on hand but its disappearance, or its control by foreigners, will mean a large reduction of those stocks.</P>
    <P>If a foreign combine gets the grip here which it is aiming to get, it will result in the disappearance of that industry, except in so far as it suits the profit-making interests of that combine to continue it.  On the day on which they see that their profits will be increased by the shutting down of Irish mills, they will shut them down.  In relation to this matter the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not take into account the position of the workers employed in the existing mills.  He appears to view with calmness the possibility of them becoming unemployed. My objection to the process of rationalisation is that it will increase unemployment.  I do not think that a period of economic stress, such as that now existing in the country, is a period in which any big rationalisation scheme that is likely to increase unemployment should be embarked upon.  I think that those who urge rationalisation in England and other European countries are concerned more with their own personal interests than <Col N="953" /> with the welfare of their country. The result of those schemes has tended towards a movement for increasing price, and I believe that the rationalisation of the milling industry here will have identical results. The only possibility of getting good results from rationalisation is if it is controlled and directed by the central authority, namely, the Government. I therefore urge the advisability of adopting this motion.  It does not ask too much; in fact it asks too little.  It will do no harm. It is merely a direction to the Government that it should provide a scheme of national control which will furnish adequate safeguards for the industry and for the safety of the public.</P>

      <P>I had some belief that Deputy Anthony in moving the resolution would have adverted to one thing and given us a clear line on a Labour matter.  One of the difficulties under which Irish milling suffers in this country is the refusal of certain Labour elements to allow up-to-date machinery to be used at the ports.  If the Deputy is concerned <Col N="954" /> about the flour-milling industry, he knows the protection which milling has in the country by way of freight paid on flour as between Liverpool and this country is reduced to some extent by the obstructionist tactics of certain Labour operatives with regard to machinery for unloading grain in use in all the ports that compete and the ports where grain is landed to compete with flour brought into this country.  That is a point on which the Deputy might give us some enlightenment before the debate ends.  What are the circumstances under which this motion is brought before the House?  Two things are spoken of.  First, that a certain English miller has come into this country and has acquired possession of a certain group of mills previously owned by Irishmen.  I said previously that that did not happen through anything arising from the state of trade in this country or from the state of the flour-milling business, but for reasons that were peculiar and private to the individual concerned. Deputy Anthony, at any rate, in his speech sets aside for this night's discussion all talk of foreign capital. With that he is not very much concerned to-night.  What he is concerned about is to have the production of flour in this country maintained at least in the same volume as at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And increased if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And increased if possible.  The advent of an outside miller in this country in certain Irish mills, if he continues to produce in this country and if he increases production in these mills, is not a bad thing from Deputy Anthony's point of view.  It is not a bad thing from my point of view, but it is one of the features of the case.  The second feature is that there is a rationalisation scheme going on in England under the ægis of the Millers' Mutual Association, and an approach was made either by that Association to the Irish millers or by the Irish millers to that Association with a view to having Ireland included in <Col N="955" /> the rationalisation scheme.  The fear is expressed that if that scheme operates, the amount of flour manufactured in this country may decrease and may eventually be reduced to almost nothing.</P>
      <P>How far has the scheme got at the moment?  How far has the association attempted between the Mutual Millers on the one hand and the Irish millers on the other progressed? Has a pool been formed?  Has the money been put down?  Have the terms and the conditions on which the Irish millers have been let into that Association been drafted?  Are they known?  Have the Irish millers, if they entered into any agreement, asked that in the event of an Irish miller being assigned a certain quota and going out of production, that his quota should be first offered for production amongst the remaining Irish millers?  Has that condition been agreed to if it was put up, and if it was not put up, why was it not put up?  Does anybody know anything about the scheme, and if nobody knows about the scheme why is there all this apprehension about imminent danger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I understood the situation when I was last advised of it, there was a reluctance on the part of the English Association to allow the Irish Association in unless they were able to bring almost the whole of the Irish millers.  If we have Irish millers of a patriotic type, Irish millers believing that Irish milling can be efficiently conducted in this country by keeping out of the scheme, they can wreck the scheme. Are they going to wreck it?  Are they going to avert the danger which they believe to be imminent or are they going to drag it on themselves? These are questions which have to be answered.  Supposing a scheme has not been perfected yet, what is all the pother about?  What has happened? An English miller has acquired possession of a group of Irish mills, an efficient English miller, one of the best of them.  Is he likely to produce flour in this country at an economic rate?  Is he <Col N="956" /> likely, having come into this country, to destroy all the capital he has sunk in this venture and to clear out?  Is he likely to do that when it is very definitely known that that individual, previous to his securing possession of Bannatyne's mills, was anxious to come in here to build a mill of his own and to embark on a new capital venture either at Foynes or at Dublin? Is that the type of individual who is likely to close down the mills once he has secured them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened at York?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take this country and leave York alone.  Why should that happen?  Is there any likelihood of it happening?  When there is evidence that it is likely there is a new situation.  There is no evidence of that at the moment. If one could segregate this milling business from everything else to-night, could consider it in vacuo, if it had no reaction on credit or on the business of the country generally, one might easily take certain steps and proceed to certain drastic measures but when it has these reactions it is a serious thing to seize control of an industry and to do what the scheme which Deputy Anthony put forward really asks us to do.  There should be some evidence of danger; there should be some nearer prospect of danger than any evidence we have had so far before we are asked to take this step. If we are asked to take this step I doubt if it is the proper step to secure what the Deputy requires.  I want to ask the Deputy, if he has considered this scheme, what is at the base of it?  Is it that there should be preserved in this country flour-milling irrespective of what the product is going to cost or is it that it should be preserved in this country only if good conditions are established in the industry?  The phrase used here is &ldquo;economic prices&rdquo; in regard to flour.  What does it mean, relevant factors being taken into consideration and having regard to the national <Col N="957" /> economic gain of having flour manufactured in the Free State?</P>
      <P>Let us take the Tariff Commission Report, not in its details but in the big thing that emerged from the Report.  What did come from that? The Tariff Commission, having examined the thing up and down, having analysed all the figures put before them and taken evidence from those best qualified to give evidence, and taking all the factors urged upon their consideration came to the conclusion, that even if all Irish mills were enabled to work to full capacity, the resultant product from these mills would have to be sold here at a price higher than flour imported into the country under fair conditions could be sold at.  I stress &ldquo;under fair conditions&rdquo; because it was said in the debate that resulted from the Tariff Commission Report, and said later in the Report of the Economic Committee, that if there were evidence of dumping shown and that if dumping were to continue for any period, there would be no answer to that. The Tariff Commission found that even if the Irish mills, even as they are at the moment were worked to full capacity, we would not be able to produce flour at the same rate at which flour could be manufactured in England and sold here notwithstanding the freight on flour.</P>

I could have spoken for half an hour longer on the question not of what was revealed, but rather on the question of what was not revealed at the Commission.  I could have referred to the itinerary of the Tariff Commission and to the mills they did not visit, but I did not do so.  I carefully refrained from that because I did not want to take up the time of the House.</P>

      <P>It has quite a lot. That is the position as presented with regard to the mills in 1928.  Has there been any change since in the mills?  If not, I am going to take this resolution, and all that is founded upon it, in relation to the Tariff Commission Report.  We are asked to set up a Commission to be composed of a judge, a representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and three representatives of the flour millers.  These people are to register mills&mdash;mills &ldquo;capable of economically producing flour by a certain date.&rdquo;  Everything turns on the word &ldquo;economically.&rdquo;  What does it mean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to sell flour at an economic price. Again the word comes in.  There is no question of subsidising or galvanising into life a really uneconomic mill.  The word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; is the important word in all this connection. There is then to be a regulation of imports.  There are to be certain changes made with regard to a phrase put up previously&mdash;with regard to ownership, to get over a minor difficulty.  There we come to the kernel of the whole suggestion, that the Commission is to &ldquo;fix a maximum price for any category or categories of flour in any area or areas.&rdquo;  In case the Commission, consisting of three millers' representatives, a representative of my Department, and a judge, thinks that the millers are &ldquo;charging for any category of flour a price exceeding this maximum price, or exceeding the economic price of flour of a similar quality in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, having regard to the national economic gain of having the flour manufactured in the Free State&rdquo; then the quotas may be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation. I amplified and rather qualified that statement by saying that these are not cast-iron or sterotyped but were open to variation and amendment by the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to found myself upon the phrase at all. As to the economic price of flour one must know what is in the mind of the people who produce this scheme. Is it flour which can be sold here at the price which English flour at present is selling?  If so why not say that?  I do not see why Irish mills should not get to that position.  We asked, in the Economic Committee, certain witnesses what were the factors operating against the Irish miller which necessitated higher cost of production on this side than on the other and we were given certain things.  We asked were there any <Col N="960" /> benefits, any points in favour of the Irish flour miller manufacturing here from wheat imported, and we were told there were.  We tried to get a balance between these two things. As far as I am concerned, I made up my mind that the advantage was definitely to the Irish millers, manufacturing in this country, even from imported wheat.  Certain of that advantage was offset by the small point to which I referred&mdash;the peculiar labour conditions here.  But on the whole, the mills manufacturing here under the best conditions have an advantage over flour manufactured on the other side and brought to this country for sale.  If this scheme means that we should assist, and we should keep alive mills which can and which will eventually manufacture in this country at a price comparable with that at which imported flour can be sold, then, it is a good scheme.  But it is not, if the words &ldquo;economic price,&rdquo; mean a price, plus certain conditions; if that means the price at which mills, running in Ireland under present conditions can manufacture&mdash;the average of them, the best of them, or the worst of them.  It is not clear what that means.</P>
      <P>Before Irish millers, or before any group or representatives in this country, put up a scheme on behalf of Irish millers, they should let us know what have Irish millers done for themselves in this crisis that seems to be upon them.  One thing we are told is that some of them have been flying to the Millers' Mutual Association&mdash;some of them have not.  I asked, when speaking on the Tariff Commission Report in May, 1928, whether the applicants on reading the report were simply going to say &ldquo;That finishes the question; we do nothing more.&rdquo;  I said if they did so their fate was clear before them, they would be wiped out.  I said I hoped that that would not be the attitude taken up.  I spoke of certain details in the report, and I said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the type of the mill, its size, location and plant is the thing that is hampering this application, <Col N="961" /> there is a means provided whereby these people can get State assistance to locate themselves elsewhere, to get better plant, to get their mills made of a more economic size under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked that the millers would come forward with some scheme utilising the State assistance offered to them to put themselves in such a position that anyone reporting upon them would have to say that, with the advantage they have on the freight on imported flour, they could produce and manufacture here for sale as cheaply as any imported flour could be sold.  I repeat that again. I said that there has been in this country an examination of the industry and that there have been revealed certain defects.  It is up to these people whose defects have been revealed to see if they can be remedied, and they will get State assistance&mdash;State assistance is open to them with regard to the remedy. I said previously that I thought there had been a friendly criticism of them in the report and it was in their interests that they should themselves put their own house in order before they came looking for assistance. What do we get since?  Has there been any movement on the part of the millers to rectify the position revealed in 1928?  Nothing; merely a resolution of this sort tabled and no clear explanation as to what it means.  Does Deputy Anthony envisage eventually that the mills are going to produce and sell here as cheaply as imported flour can be brought in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the Minister cannot leave dumping out. The fact is that English millers are producing in four-and-a-half days what the British public are able to consume, and the remaining one-and-a-half days are devoted to producing flour for dumping in this country, and selling it under the cost of production. The Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tariff Commission was set up to examine, amongst other things, the question of dumping.  They called for evidence of it, and their finding was given, &ldquo;No clear and definite examples however of such undercutting have been placed before the Commission.&rdquo; They stated their view &ldquo;That the bigger capital and production <Col N="963" /> of these mills and their greater efficiency enabled them to quote lower terms without resorting to dumping.&rdquo;  It is this lower price without resorting to dumping that must be our standard.  Is it a fair standard?  I think it is.  Deputy Lemass asked what evidence would I require.  I can answer that more in a negative than a positive way. There was evidence which purported to show dumping given before a Committee on which Deputy Lemass served, that did not appeal to the majority of the members, as proving dumping.  I have evidence given from time to time that shows flour sold in small lots over long periods in the year&mdash;with long intervals between sales, not regular selling, a sale here and a sale there, that is not dumping.  If there is dumping there must be evidence of it.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  One might as well say that because there was a rationalisation scheme carried out in connection with the mineral water industry here, we are dumping mineral waters into England. One must get evidence of flour being dumped in this country.  As to all <Col N="964" /> this talk about four-and-a-half days and one-and-a-half days, and overproduction, and all that, scattered here, we have to see signs of that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have what was put forward as evidence from time to time, but which on examination did not stand the test.  If there is dumping, that is a different question. That is another matter which can be dealt with.  I ask what is the test to be put on the scheme?  Is it the test of meeting lower terms to which the Commission referred in 1928 in their report&mdash;the lower terms that these mills can give by reason of capital, production and efficiency?  All that is operating against the freight that has to be paid on flour as between Liverpool and this country&mdash;a protection which already exists for the Irish manufacturers at home.  Let us get evidence that the millers in this country mean business, that they are going to carry through a rationalisation scheme on their own with Government assistance.  Let us get some sort of evidence that there is a reasonable prospect ahead for such a move, that in the end there is going to be a good production of flour here, that there is going to be a weeding out of mills, either by purchase or crushing out, which clog production. Let us get evidence of a better concentration in bigger units under better control and we will help all that.  Then a scheme can be hammered out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason at present to embark on a scheme like that, the basis of which is to sell at an economic price&mdash;an undefined term&mdash;because an English miller of proved efficiency has come in, for reasons not connected with the milling industry in this country, and taken over a certain group of Irish mills.  Leaving <Col N="965" /> out the question of foreign capital in this country we regard that as a good move.  It is likely to increase efficiency here, and it is quite possible that starting from that move there may be a rationalisation scheme put through in this country.</P>
    <P>There are certain points in regard to Irish wheat, and I would prefer if Deputy Anthony left out that question altogether, because it would simplify the problem.  That scheme has in it Irish wheat.  I believe that scheme has in it Irish wheat only as what I might call a vote catching item.  To my mind, when it is clearly understood, it is going to have a boomerang effect and will lose votes, because undoubtedly it means that the costs of including a certain amount of Irish wheat will have to be borne eventually by the consumers of bread.  We can discuss this without wheat being brought in, and it would be far better to do that.  If we have a wheat scheme mixed up with this we will never get to the end of the discussion.</P>

      <P>It is so much my job that regarding this as not putting the industry on a sound footing I refuse to accept this scheme.  I think a good scheme can be hammered out.  It is going to require initiative from the millers.  It will certainly require their help and a very definite facing up to the difficulties and to the prospects.  They must face up to this: that we demand of them, and we can demand of them with justice, that they must aim at producing flour here and selling it as cheaply as it is at present imported under fair conditions.  Let us get any evidence that there is of a scheme&mdash;a rationalisation scheme, any scheme at all of control, or anything else that will bring about that condition&mdash;and we will give it assistance. I do not know what form that assistance would take; it would depend on the scheme that was put up. But in the present circumstances this scheme does not stand consideration, it does not clearly tell us what we are aiming at, and it does not clearly define what are the circumstances in which anyone has thought fit to move that a scheme of that kind would be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has gone back to the Tariff Commission report to get an argument to go on, but he has not produced the evidence upon which the Tariff Commission reported when they stated that flour could not be produced by the Irish flour millers at an economic rate.  He made great capital out of the fact that the Irish flour millers, in the proposal which they have put before him, have used the very same phrase which he has used over and over again in attempting to place the Irish flour-milling industry in the most unfavourable position generally and to prejudice its claims for protection.  He now complains of that very same phrase, &ldquo;at an economic rate,&rdquo; because the Irish flour millers have simply taken his own phrase, which he and his Tariff Commission have used repeatedly in alleging that flour could not be produced in this country at a price equivalent to what it is being <Col N="969" /> sold at in Great Britain.  They have taken that very same phrase, they have put it down in their proposals, and the Minister is not satisfied with it.  If the phrase &ldquo;at an economic rate&rdquo; was good enough for the Tariff Commission to damn the application for a tariff on flour, then surely it ought to be good economics, at least as a basis for discussion as to the price which will eventually be fixed for Irish flour, if some scheme as is proposed is carried out.</P>
      <P>But the Irish flour millers have not tied down the Minister or the country to the basis of an economic rate.  They have not gone on phrases; they have suggested that a Judge should definitely be appointed and that this Judge should have the sole authority to decide what is the economic rate.  They have stated that they are prepared to give any guarantees that the country wants in regard to price, and I think they have specifically stated that one of these guarantees was that the maximum price in the Free State would not be any more than the current English price.  There may be a difficulty in deciding what is the current English price.  That would be a question for the Judge to decide if this Commission is set up, and in deciding it he will have an informed public opinion behind him.  Can there be any question upon which public opinion is more likely to assert itself, and more likely to be fully conversant with all the facts of the situation, than on the question whether the price of flour is going up or down?  Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to make out that the flour millers have insidiously laid some kind of trap by which, in spite of the guarantee to the public that a Judge will be appointed, who will specifically state what the price will be and, furthermore, that the price in any case will not be above the current English price, the Irish flour millers can fool the public and can actually overcharge for a considerable time.  If that is so I wonder what public opinion of this country will be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Furthermore, the books of the flour millers would be available. They have been made available already to the Tariff Commission in secret.  We have not that evidence, any more than we have Mr. Rank's evidence, or the other evidence, which made this splendid Tariff Commission, which never even went to the trouble of walking into the mills that they afterwards condemned as badly managed, ill-equipped, inefficient and the rest of it, come to their conclusions.  These gentlemen's ipse dixit is going to be taken now, and the Minister is going to refer back to it as a final solution of this problem.  That is too good a thing.  At least we would have expected from the Minister that he would have taken this question seriously.  To say that these proposals are unworkable is not enough: they are, at any rate, proposals.</P>
    <P>We know it could be said that the Irish flour millers could not come together in an organised body, any more than any other industry.  When rationalisation started in Germany and in England there was no united and completely homogeneous demand for it.  We have the Minister for Agriculture telling us that when he rationalised the dairying industry, if he got 70 or 75 per cent. of the Irish farmers behind him he would coerce the other 25 or 30 per cent. into doing what is necessary for the good of the country.  If that is good economics and good national policy in regard to the dairying industry, it ought to be good enough for this industry.  But it is not good enough for the Minister.  We do not know whether the application of the English Mutual Organisation or the selling of a group of Irish mills to Messrs.  Rank were not occasioned by depression and bad trading conditions here, in spite of what the Minister said.  We have the Minister's word that it was not so.  We would like to have the evidence on which he based his conclusion.  But even if it is because a certain body of the Irish flour millers are not patriotic and have gone to the English <Col N="971" /> organisation, that is no reason why the Minister should put the onus on the remainder of the industry and say: &ldquo;You can take it or leave it.  I am not going to take any steps in this matter.  I leave it to yourselves, either to join the English rationalisation scheme and participate in the benefits of it, to whatever <Col N="972" /> extent you can do so, or else to remain out and let the English rationalisation scheme kill you afterwards with its competition and its dumping.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In the case of the Westmeath County Council, a sum of £11,159 12s. 8d. was, at February, 1925, absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in respect of charges against the fund for arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, etc., covering the years from 1922 to 1925.  This amount was met by the county share in the Estate Duty Grant for the years 1922 to 1925, as to a sum of £10,009 11s., and as to the balance&mdash; namely, £1,150 1s. 8d., out of the county share in the Agricultural Grant.  A further sum of £1,487 16s. 7d. in respect of Estate Duty Grant was absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in respect of further similar charges against the Fund between February, 1925, and February, <Col N="811" /> 1926.  By February, 1927, repayments by the County of arrears of Annuities enabled a net sum of £1,033 18s. 2d. to be repaid to the Council in respect of the amount of Estate Duty Grant previously absorbed in the Guarantee Fund, while the amount that had been deducted from the Agricultural Grant, viz., £1,150 1s. 8d., was repaid in full by April, 1927, to the Council out of balances of shares of the County in the Estate Duty Grant between 1925 and 1927.  At February, 1927, the position was, therefore, as follows:&mdash; Amount absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in respect of Agricultural Grant, nil; in respect of Estate Duty Grant, £11,613 11s. 1d.  Between February, 1927, and February, 1928, there was absorbed in the Guarantee Fund a further sum of £7,351 1s. 7d. in respect of further charges against the Fund for arrears of Land Purchase Annuities, etc. This amount was met as to a sum of £1,485 4s. 9d. out of Estate Duty Grant and as to a sum of £5,865 16s. 10d. out of Agricultural Grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between February, 1928, and February, 1929, a further sum of £1,090 17s. 1d was absorbed in the Guarantee Fund, and between February, 1929, and February, 1930, a further sum of £1,109 8s.  The balances of the shares of the county in the Estate Duty Grant for 1928 and 1929, amounting to £1,421 7s. 5d., were applied to the reduction of the sum of £5,865 16s. 10d. absorbed as agricultural grant and issued to the county council as such.  The position at February, 1930, was as follows:&mdash; Amount absorbed in the Guarantee Fund as estate duty grant, £16,720 8s. 4d.; as agricultural grant, £4,444 9s. 5d.  These figures relate to the period from the year 1921 up to February, 1930.  Any sums outstanding in respect of estate duty grant or agricultural grant, which have been absorbed in the Guarantee Fund to meet the charges imposed by law upon that fund, will be paid to Westmeath County Council according as the arrears of land purchase <Col N="812" /> annuities, etc., in the county are paid off.</P>
