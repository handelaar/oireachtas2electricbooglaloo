O'Connell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go back over any part of the ground which I covered last night in relation to this Bill, but there are one or two matters concerning the proposal to establish a coastal borough and the proposed constitution of the new municipal council that I would like to refer to again.  The Minister for Education stated that there was no community of interest between the districts which it is proposed to include in the coastal borough and the districts which it is proposed to include in the Dublin municipality. He did not, however, set out to prove that statement.  He stated that the onus of proof rested upon those who opposed the Bill.  I deny that entirely. I deny that we should accept the situation that now exists as the natural order of affairs.  Obviously, the contention of the Minister for Education is that the method of local government in Dublin which was created by the British Government for the purposes of the British Government is one that cannot be questioned without very good cause.  The onus of proving that there is any necessity to partition the City of Dublin rests upon the framers of the Bill.  Despite that fact, however, I do think it can be shown that there is a community of interest between the two areas which more than off-sets any case which has been adduced or can be adduced to justify the partition proposal.  The Minister for Education referred to the statement which had been made by Deputy O'Connell to the effect that there was, for example, one transport system in both areas.  He seemed to treat that as a very trivial point, not worthy of any serious consideration. Let us examine whether that particular point is serious or trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are informed that we are shortly to have introduced here a Bill to regulate traffic in Dublin City.  What that Bill will propose I do not yet know, but, presumably, it will be based upon the report of the <Col N="1027" /> Tribunal which was established by the Government consequent on the lock-out of the workers of the Dublin United Tramways Company last August.  That Tribunal recommended three possible solutions of the transport difficulty in Dublin; first, municipal ownership; second, municipal control, and, third, some form of supervision over privately-owned companies.  If it should happen, for example, that the Government accept the proposal that public passenger-carrying transport services in Dublin should be acquired by the Dublin Municipal Council, surely it becomes a matter of very vital importance in relation to this Bill, in view of the fact that the same system operates in the municipal area and the proposed coastal borough area.  Are we going to have a new authority established to secure the necessary co-ordination in the event of that proposal being adopted or are we going to have the passenger-carrying services owned by the City of Dublin operating in the area of the coastal borough?  Would the proposed coastal borough council agree to such an arrangement?  A whole host of new difficulties will arise if this coastal borough be established as soon as this transport problem is tackled.  No matter what solution the Government is determined on, they are going to make new difficulties for themselves in consequence of the passage of this Bill unless their solution is the likely one of leaving things as they are. The Minister for Education treated this matter of transport as a point of no importance.  In my opinion, it is a point of very great importance. The question of the future of the public transport services in Dublin must be tackled some time.  We are convinced that, if it is properly tackled, the proposal to acquire these transport services by the Municipality for the purpose of having them operated without profit in the public interest will be the one adopted.</P>
    <P>That is only one matter in which there is community of interest.  It is an important matter, but nevertheless <Col N="1028" /> only one.  There are quite a number of others.  I mentioned yesterday the matter of drainage.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health seemed to think that the difficulties arising out of the existence of two separate drainage systems was an argument in favour of partition.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the matter again, by way of interruption, while I was talking, and I instanced one particular aspect of that drainage problem which does establish a very direct and important community of interest between the two areas.  The drainage from the townships which it is proposed to constitute into a coastal borough is at present emptied untreated into the waters of Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>It is in these waters that the poor children of the Dublin slums get their only opportunity of enjoying sea bathing.  No council with the interests of these inhabitants of the Dublin slums at heart would tolerate for one moment the continuance of the drainage system now in operation in the coastal borough area. But the important ratepayers of the coastal borough are not so much concerned.  They are enjoying the benefit of a saving of a penny or twopence in the £ in their rates, and they can get their own sea bathing at Llandudno, or Brighton, or somewhere else.  There is a community of interest in that particular matter, at any rate, between the two areas which would justify the abolition of this proposal to establish a separate authority for the coastal township area.  There are quite a number of other matters.  I do not think it will be seriously maintained by anyone that the system of food inspection or the public health services would not be improved in both areas if they were under one authority.  Surely, the duplication of services in relation to these matters cannot possibly make for efficiency.  There is the question of road making.  The problems arising out of the existence of the tram rails on the streets are common to both areas.  We know, from the evidence given before the Tramways Tribunal, that in consequence of the existence of these rails, <Col N="1029" /> streets have to be paved in asphalt, whereas otherwise they could be paved in concrete at a reduced cost. That problem is common to the two areas and a solution of it will be of advantage to both areas.  Then there is the question of the fire brigade, which I mentioned yesterday.  There is the question of technical education, another service which could obviously be improved throughout the whole area if brought under one authority.  In respect to all the services which are common to both districts, unity of control would obviously make for efficiency.  Above everything else, the ratepayers of both districts have this interest in common, that they want efficient services at a cheap rate.</P>
    <P>No case has been made out by the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Education in support of the former Minister's contention, that the unification of the two districts would not reduce the city rates by one halfpenny.  Surely, if we were to save nothing more than the salary of the duplicated mayor, we would be effecting a reduction in the rates.  The cost of buying a new mace for the new city could be saved, if no other economy could be effected.  If we are tackling this question seriously, from the point of view of efficiency and economy only, no case has been made for the establishment of the coastal borough. What I said yesterday, I say again&mdash; the only reason which exists for the establishment of this new city is a political one, and if the business community, and the ratepayers of the city, are prepared to pay through their rates for the privilege of having this new city for political purposes then they are much more foolish than I think they are, or than they represent themselves to be.</P>
    <P>When I moved the adjournment last night, I was discussing the commercial register.  I maintain that the theory on which this proposal is based is that administrative ability increases in proportion to a man's wealth.  I produce the President as a witness against the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us definitely that, from his experience as a member of the Dublin Corporation, administrative ability was not a monopoly of any one class.  He found businessmen who were bad administrators and workingmen who were bad administrators; he found representatives from both classes who were good administrators.  How he squares his advocacy of this Bill with that statement, I do not know. We will be very glad to hear him attempt it.  I do not think it can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has been promising quite a number of surprises.  In any case, the proposal is fundamentally wrong.  Of course, we had the Minister for Education, who, realising that the Bill is undemocratic, sought to defend the Government's position by attacking democracy.  I do not know if members of Cumann na nGaedheal are prepared to stand behind the Minister for Education under that banner.  I presume that, as democratically elected representatives, they are anxious to preserve democratic institutions in this city.  In fact, every citizen, every ratepayer, every owner of property pays rates in equal proportion to his wealth.  It is not true that one individual who happens to have a big bank balance pays more than another who happens to have no bank balance at all.  All ratepayers, even though they pay rates through their rent, have a direct interest in the efficient carrying out of the municipal services. The system of giving preference to those who happen to have a greater proportion of the world's goods cannot possibly be justified.  When, however, we find that the system also includes the giving of preferential treatment to foreign companies who have established places of business in Dublin, any justification for the Bill becomes obviously impossible. The Minister for Education said that there are some people who have foreign companies on the brain. <Col N="1031" /> He is right.  Most Irish manufacturers and a large number of traders are getting foreign companies on the brain.  We have foreign companies on the brain.  We have had a number of old-established firms in Dublin recently acquired by these foreign combines. We have other firms closed down in consequence of the competition of the foreign combines, and we have had a considerable number of people thrown out of employment in consequence of the transfer of ownership of Irish concerns to foreigners. It is no wonder some of us are getting foreign companies on the brain.  But when we see the Government coming forward with a proposal to give these foreign companies not merely a vote, but six votes, for the election of the municipal council of Dublin, we are not surprised that their spokesman has to attack the fundamental idea of democracy in order to justify it.</P>

    <P>The proposal to establish a managerial system in Dublin has probably provoked more opposition than any other proposal in the Bill.  Every section in the community has expressed its objection to this proposal. I want that clearly understood by all Deputies.  The opposition to this proposal does not merely come from the adherents of the Fianna Fáil Party or the adherents of the Labour Party.  You heard Deputy O'Kelly yesterday reading the evidence given before the Greater Dublin Commission by Mr. J.C.M. Eason on behalf of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce; you heard the statement I read which was made in an interview with a Press representative by the Chairman of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, Mr. McGloughlin, to the effect that if the Bill passed in its present form he hoped that the Council would be boycotted by all classes. Every section of the community is against the proposal.  We passed the Cork Bill as an experiment in municipal government.  Has the experiment been a success?  Has the experiment so justified itself that we should adopt the same proposals <Col N="1032" /> without alteration here in Dublin? We have the Cork Municipal Council on strike; we have them by a two-thirds majority refusing to strike the rates.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out by Deputy Davin, the majority on the Cork Corporation is not composed of the adherents of one section or of two sections only; it includes the official Cumann na nGaedheal representatives on that Council.  Are they satisfied that the experiment which we started when we passed the Cork Bill has proved successful?  The operation of that system there has destroyed all public interest in the activities of the Cork Municipal Council; the operation of that system there has resulted in an average attendance of members at the meetings generally less than fifty per cent.; the operation of that system there has produced nothing but friction from the day it started, and yet we have the Minister coming with this proposal to apply it without alteration to the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some discussion yesterday about the powers which it is proposed to confer on the manager and the powers which it is proposed to confer on the council.  Deputy O'Connell asked if the council could decide that three-roomed, four-roomed or five-roomed houses were to be built under any municipal housing scheme.  The President said that they could.  I want the President to give us chapter and verse for that. Undoubtedly the council could refuse to strike a rate.  They are given the purely negative power of refusing to agree with the manager's decisions. The reserved powers of the council are set out in Section 49.  The Bill declares that the manager shall perform and exercise all the powers, functions and duties of the city corporation other than those reserved functions.  If the President can twist the meaning of any single one of these sub-sections to show that the council will have the right to decide such questions of policy as the type <Col N="1033" /> of houses to be built he will be able to give new meanings to a very large number of English words.  The only way in which the council can possibly exercise any power is by refusing to strike a rate.  The Minister has told us that their object was to provide a City Manager to deal with the executive and administrative side of what the council wanted to do. They failed in their attempt.  They have certainly done nothing to justify the Minister's assertion that they have drawn a clear line between the administrative and the legislative functions.  Surely it is a question of policy whether the type of houses to be built in a city is to be three-roomed or four-roomed or five-roomed; surely it is a question of policy whether the streets are to be paved with wood blocks or cobbles, with asphalt or with concrete.  Can the council decide what the surfacing of the streets is to be, or is that power reserved to the Manager under this Bill?  I say that that power is given to the Manager, with this exception, that the council can refuse to agree with him.  The council cannot, on its own initiative, decide any one of these questions. Surely it is a question of policy whether the city is to be lit by gas or by electricity.  Can the council decide that under the Bill?  If so, we want chapter and verse.  If the coastal borough wants to abolish the present system of drainage can it decide to do so?  Is not that decision also reserved to the Manager under the Bill, and is not that decision also a question of policy?  The council which it is proposed to establish under this Bill is nothing more or less than a farce.  It has no real power whatever.  If it is established with the abbreviated powers which it is proposed by the Executive Council to give it, I hope, with the chairman of the Port and Docks Board, that all classes of the community will combine to boycott it.</P>
    <P>We agree that the administrative and legislative functions of the Corporation should be divided and given respectively to a City Manager and an elected council, but we want to see a proper division, and, what is <Col N="1034" /> more than that, we want to see the chief executive officer of the Corporation subordinate to the elected representatives. If the Executive Council had not suddenly acquired these new ideas about democracy and were framing a Bill that was a serious attempt to deal with local government problems here, we would have set out in the Bill the powers which it was proposed to give to the Manager, and an omnibus clause to the effect that all other powers and functions were reserved to the council.  The very wording of the Bill is designed to ensure that the Manager will be superior to the council.  It was certainly no business man who suggested this arrangement; any business man would have attempted to ensure that municipal affairs would be controlled in the same way as the affairs of a business company are controlled.  In a business company you have the general body of shareholders, and these shareholders elect their representatives&mdash;the board of directors. The board of directors appoint a general manager, and they give that general manager a free hand in relation to executive actions.  But they hold that manager responsible to them, and they are at liberty to dismiss him at any time if they are dissatisfied with his services.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can seriously pretend that the administrative ability of the Manager would be curtailed by making him subordinate to the council.  Does the Minister assert that his administrative ability as Minister for Local Government is curtailed by the fact that he has to come here every day the Dáil is in session and answer questions relating to the work of his Department? This City Manager need not attend meetings of the council and answer questions relating to his work; he can give whatever information he likes, or no information if he does not like.  He is in every sense the autocrat of the city, much more of an autocrat than the King of England or any other monarch in Europe.  We are anxious to see a system of municipal government established that will result in <Col N="1035" /> efficient service being given to the ratepayers for the money that is spent.  We believe that that efficient service can best be secured under popular control.</P>
    <P>We learn, from the experience of the city during the past five years under the administration of the Commissioners, the lesson that you cannot get increased efficiency by the abolition of democratic control. The Minister for Education said that the appointment of the Commissioners was a great step forward. It was a great step forward for those who are now enrolling themselves under the banner of Mussolini, but it was not anything in the nature of a step forward for the citizens of Dublin.  We find ourselves to-day, five years after they were first appointed, with a municipal debt increased by £2,000,000, with municipal services costing more than they cost in the year 1920, with these services in many respects curtailed, with the civic spirit killed and public interest in the affairs of the Corporation non-existent.  What have the City Commissioners to put upon the other side of the balance sheet?  No doubt the President or the Minister will tell us that.  I doubt if they can discover any compensating advantages gained.  If the City Commissioners are to be produced as an argument in favour of the managerial system, then that system stands condemned.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council have apparently come to the decision that they cannot stand for this Bill as it now reads.  We have had the Minister for Education telling us that it was possibly true that there might be an obscurity as to the relative positions of the council and the Manager, but reasonable amendments could be introduced to define clearly the functions of both.  We had experience of what the Minister and the Executive Council considered reasonable amendments when the Cork City Management Bill was going through the Dáil.  It was proposed, for example, that the question of whether or not preference <Col N="1036" /> should be given to Irish-manufactured goods should be reserved to the Council, and the Minister opposed the proposal.  Surely that was a reasonable amendment, because the question involved was one of policy and not administration. We had a proposal that the Council should decide the rates of pay that were to apply to the various classes of employees of the Corporation, and that proposal was defeated by the Government majority, although it was also obviously a matter of policy.  We had a number of similar proposals put forward from these Benches and the Labour Benches which were all negatived by Cumann na nGaedheal.  If these were not reasonable proposals then we find ourselves incapable of producing reasonable proposals.</P>
    <P>If the Government have in mind any reasonable alterations to the Bill other than those we have suggested, they will have to produce them themselves if they want them embodied in the text.  In any case, I do not think the Bill is capable of amendment. As I have said already, it is one of the most poorly drafted Bills ever submitted to the House.  That is probably not the fault of the official draftsman, but due to the fact that it was amended and re-amended by the Executive Council during the two or three months before it was produced in the Dáil.  The Bill is not capable of amendment, certainly it is not capable of amendment by a private Deputy.  No one could sit down to alter any of the important provisions on the Bill without the assistance of the official draftsman. If badly drafted amendments are produced we know that they will be ridiculed by the Minister and defeated as such, whatever the merits of the proposals enshrined in them may be.  It took the Executive Council three and a half years to produce the Bill and they suggest Deputies should be able to amend it in a fortnight!</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has a number of other points to make also. He said that the system of local government which prevailed heretofore <Col N="1037" /> had originated and grown up in conditions very different to those which prevail now, and that there was nothing democratic in its origin.  It does not matter one iota whether or not there was anything democratic in its origin, provided it was democratic in its working.  We have compared the system which was in operation in Dublin until the establishment of the Commissioners with the system which has been in operation in Cork for the last twelve months.  On that comparison, the Dublin system undoubtedly stands out as superior. When we had the old Dublin Corporation, bad as its constitution was, we had serious attention given to a number of social problems in the city. We had a considerable volume of public interest in municipal affairs. We had a direct channel by which the views of the ratepayers could be expressed in matters relating to municipal government.  We have none of these advantages under the Cork system.</P>
    <P>We do not want to restore the old Dublin Corporation system unaltered. We believe that system is capable of amendment.  We believe that the proposal to abolish the various subcommittees of the Corporation, which carried out executive functions, and to give these functions to the Manager, is a good one.  We believe that the numerical strength of the council could be reduced with advantage. There are a number of other directions in which the old constitution of the Corporation could be improved. But the proposals contained in the Bill do not represent improvement. They represent a considerable step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly referred to another matter of considerable importance to which no reference appears in the Bill, and that is the constitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  No reference to that Board appears in the report of the Greater Dublin Commission.  That Commission heard evidence from all the officers and most of the members of the Port Board and went very thoroughly into the question of its history, its constitution, its powers and the financial results of its working. <Col N="1038" /> It did not, however, come forward with any concrete proposals and the Minister for Local Government apparently considered that was sufficient justification for leaving it alone also.</P>
    <P>We have in Dublin a port authority acting under a constitution which attained its present form in about 1898.  Originally the Dublin port authority was a sub-committee of the Dublin Corporation.  In the course of years, however, that authority was abolished and a new one was set up representative not of the citizens of Dublin, but of the special interests which utilise the port.  At present the Port and Docks Board consists of six members nominated by the Dublin Municipal Council, when the Municipal Council exists; nine shipping members, representative of the shipping interests and twelve traders members representative of the traders' interests. The Board is elected on a most extraordinary franchise.  As I said yesterday, foreign ship owners using the port have votes; in fact some of them have ten votes in the election of the Dublin Port Authority.  I do not know of any other port in the world where that system prevails.</P>
    <P>The elections are carried out practically in secret.  I am certain that there are a very large number of persons in Dublin eligible to vote in these elections who never hear about them, who do not know when or where the elections are held, and have not the remotest idea of what the constitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board is.  We believe the citizens of Dublin have a very direct interest in the management of the Port.  Statements were made at a public meeting in the Mansion House quite recently that the Port authority is in the grip of the combine that controls all the shipping from Irish harbours&mdash;Coastways, Limited.  The Port authority, under its present constitution, could certainly be controlled by any vested interest that set out to do so.  If we are going to have the port of Dublin properly developed, in the interests of the people of Dublin, we must secure that the Dublin Corporation, <Col N="1039" /> or a Committee of the Dublin Corporation, shall again be substituted for the existing Board.  The Port dues in Dublin are higher than in any other Irish port except Derry; they are higher than those prevailing in a very large number of English ports.  The Port Board is concerned only with the particular interest of the shippers and traders who are represented by the members constituting the Board.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, instead of examining that constitution, for the purpose of seeing how to amend it, propose to leave it unaltered, and are actually taking some of the ideas enshrined in it for the purpose of applying them to the city as a whole.  Even if they do not want to alter the constitution of the Board, there are a number of problems relating to the Port with which they should deal in this Bill.  Take, for example, the development of the south quays.  There are at present no railway facilities to the south quays.  The Board have no power in connection with that matter, and they have repeatedly pointed out that until proper facilities for the carriage of goods are provided it will not be possible properly to develop that portion of the Port. Surely the introduction of a Bill of this kind afforded an opportunity to rectify that position and to give either to the Board or the Corporation the necessary powers to provide railway facilities in that part of the Dublin Port.  The onus of repairing the roads at the North, South and East Walls is on the Corporation. There is, however, dual control, and, in consequence of that dual control, there is inefficiency, due to overlapping, and consequent loss to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>It has been advocated by the representatives of the Board who appeared before the Greater Dublin Commission that the Corporation should undertake the responsibility of maintaining and cleaning the whole of the Port area.  There is, in any case, the urgent question of widening the north and south quays, so that the present traffic congestion <Col N="1040" /> might be eased.  The Board has no power to do so.  The Corporation has no power to do it either, so that, in consequence of the dual system of control, the position must remain as it is.  Surely that is another question that should have been faced by the Executive Council when this Bill was under consideration.  Surely, that is another matter that might have been dealt with when the whole system of local government in Dublin was being revised.  It is also suggested that the harbours in Dublin Bay should be put under one authority. The Dublin Port and Docks Board say that they should be the authority. Certainly there is a case to be made against the creation of a position that might result in the rise of competition for traffic between such harbours as Dun Laoghaire Harbour and Dublin Port.  The development of such competition would not result in efficiency or in securing lower dues in either case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly described this Bill as a rotten Bill.  I think the President should recognise it as such and agree to withdraw before we waste any more time discussing it.  Nobody wants the Bill.  That, of course, is only a minor matter with those who have lost their interest in democracy. But I would take this opportunity of reminding members of Cumann na nGaedheal who do not represent Dublin constituencies and who are not conversant with the Dublin problem, that no one in Dublin wants this Bill.  The ratepayers of the city do not want it; the Trades Council does not want it, the Chamber of Commerce does not want it, the Rathmines Council does not want it and the Pembroke Council does not want it.  No one wants it except the Executive Council, and they are proceeding to force this Bill upon the citizens against the will of the citizens. That is the new democracy. That is what they learned from Mussolini at Geneva.</P>

The speeches we had from the Minister for Local Government and from the Minister for Education were not speeches in support of the Bill; they were apologies for the Bill.  The Minister in charge of the Bill knew before he came to the House to move the Second Reading, that this Bill was a rotten one, and he devoted all his time and attention to meeting criticism which had been voiced in the columns of the public Press.  He could not tell of one single advantage that was going to be conferred on anyone as a result of its passage.  There are, perhaps, one or two exceptions; a few friends of the Executive Council might gain by this Bill&mdash;the prospective managers for the city and for the coastal borough.</P>

      <P>Up to the tail-end of Deputy Lemass's speech I rather congratulated myself that this debate was free from any rancour or political heat.  I am sorry that this was introduced then. I think the criticisms of the Bill have, on the whole, been very fair, <Col N="1043" /> and they ought to show the Minister that there is really anxiety on the part of a good many people in this House that a Bill should be produced really worthy of Dublin.  We had hoped that following on the Committee's Report that a Bill would be introduced which would produce a greater Dublin.  This Bill is not doing it.  It is producing a big Dublin and a little Dublin which we do not want, and it will make it more difficult as time goes on and there is an anxiety for welding them together to do that.  The Minister for Education, I think, said that there was no case for introducing Blackrock, Kingstown, Dalkey and such places into the Greater Dublin area.  I think he said that there was no community of interests beyond the fact that they were all on the same tramline.  I think that if he is right, and there is no community of interests, that is the reason there should be a community of interests to enable these outlying places to have the advantages which would be enjoyed by Dublin and places more adjacent to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in this Bill because I am a Deputy from the county and as such I have not heard from any of the bodies which represent the ratepayers of the county any desire for the Bill.  Rathmines is definitely against it; Pembroke is definitely against it.  Very possibly their opposition is selfish and not unreasonably so.  They are extremely well-managed townships and rates are not unduly high.  The services are very good and the ratepayers on the whole are satisfied with the present state of affairs.  I have the greatest sympathy with Rathmines and Pembroke but at the same time, I say that they cannot always expect to be left out of a greater Dublin, and possibly if a Bill were introduced safeguarding them in certain respects such as giving them full representation for their populations as they are at present and if they obtained recognition for the money that has been sunk in their own services such as waterworks <Col N="1044" /> in Rathmines and various things of that sort I think they would recognise that they ought to accept the inevitable and come in with good grace.  However, I cannot say that definitely for them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is wrong to my mind for this reason, that the time has come when we should have one large, greater Dublin.  On that subject, I think, no reference has been made to the places north of Clontarf such as Baldoyle, Portmarnock, Howth and Malahide.  I received a deputation the other day from representatives of those districts and they wanted to know why there was not a coastal borough for the north side as well as the south.  They said they wanted better services.  It seemed to me that the Minister should have introduced a Bill embracing all those outlying places on the north and the south side and that we should have one Greater Dublin.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that as far as I can make out nobody is in favour of this Bill except, perhaps, the Minister. I know that the Minister has devoted an extraordinary amount of attention to the Bill and I am sure that he thought he was producing what was really the best.  Still he must be influenced to a certain extent by what he hears outside and what he reads in the newspapers.  I think he might well consider withdrawing the Bill and I am perfectly certain that the House would give him all the emergency powers he requires for maintaining the present status of the Commissioners in Dublin for a year or more so as to give him more time to examine the question more thoroughly and produce a Bill which would be more in accordance with the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>There is one other point, and that is that Deputy O'Connell's amendment has put some people in a rather awkward position.  Some people object to the Bill, but at the same time they are not entirely in agreement with Deputy O'Connell's amendment, and I am not quite clear whether there will be an opportunity, if this thing comes to a vote, for people to say definitely whether <Col N="1045" /> they wish to vote against the Second Reading of the Bill or decide on Deputy O'Connell's amendment.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Murphy, this is a reasoned amendment, which is a radically different thing from removing words, and members of the House who might agree with some of the reasons given in the amendment and disagree with others would be, by this method, prevented from expres sing their opinions.  If necessary, they will have to put down a whole series of amendments.  It seems to me that in order to get over the difficulty of people like Deputy Murphy you might put the amendment and afterwards, that amendment being cleared out of the way, you could put the Bill.  I recognise a radical difference between voting for the amendment and voting for the rejection of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I just want to put this point.  As you say, Deputy Fahy said yesterday that the question to be put from the Chair would be that the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill.  That procedure has been adopted here very often, but, as far as I can gather, it was adopted when there were several amendments and when it would not be desirable to take a vote on each particular amendment.  The way to get over that difficulty is, of course, <Col N="1047" /> to put the question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo; If there is only one amendment and that, as Deputy Flinn says, a reasoned amendment, the procedure that could be adopted and which is not a very long one, is that the question be put from the Chair that the Second Reading be not given because of these particular reasons.  A number of Deputies may think that the Second Reading should be refused, but should not be refused because of these particular reasons.  They could vote against the amendment and afterwards vote against the Second Reading.  I think, A Chinn Comhairle, that is what a number of Deputies want to do.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal for the rejection of the Bill for specific reasons.  There are two parts in this amendment&mdash;one to delete certain words, a second to substitute other words.  In such a case the procedure is, first, to ascertain whether the House is prepared to delete the words.  If it is, then the House can substitute other words. If the House is not prepared to delete the words then the amendment falls.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to take a second division, but the main question must be put from the Chair.

The amendment specifically states particular reasons why it should be done, and the whole discussion, even though it has included a discussion on the Bill, is a discussion in relation to that particular and specific amendment.  Therefore, not merely are we entitled after this amendment is defeated, if it is defeated, to divide upon the Bill, but we are entitled to proceed to discuss the Bill from any other aspect than the aspect which is covered by that reasoned amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say by way of preface that whilst I believe the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is a very industrious Minister he appears to have an unfortunate flair for introducing very unpopular measures.  This Greater Dublin Bill is of no recent conception.  The method of election to the Dublin Port and Docks Board has been frequently brought under review.  Early in 1923 the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Ernest Blythe, promised that the special franchise&mdash;plural voting and proxy voting&mdash;would be abolished when the measure dealing with the city generally was introduced.  Now the measure has at last been introduced, but instead of applying municipal franchise to the Port and Docks it is sought in this measure to extend the Port and Docks franchise to the municipality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the clause in the Bill dealing with certain privileged voters, I want to say that on one occasion in the Dublin Port and Docks Board when an attempt was made to get a popular member returned to that Board one member of the Port and Docks Board cast 1,300 votes in support of a certain ticket. Whilst I admit that in this Bill six votes is the maximum provided for, <Col N="1049" /> I would like to remind the House, and the Minister in particular, that it is not an uncommon thing in this country to have one person interested in ten companies.  I want to know from the Minister when he is replying, would this result in that particular individual being enabled to cast 60 votes.</P>

      <P>If so, the result might easily be that an Englishman, perhaps living in London and not knowing much about Ireland beyond its place on the map, a gentleman with an anti-Irish outlook perhaps&mdash; I am just taking a hypothetical case &mdash;might be able to outvote an Irishman, in Ireland, with a definite national outlook.  Apart from the rooted objection, which in common with my colleagues of the Labour Party I have, to the re-establishment of a privileged class or any addition to the already privileged class in this country, I think the Bill is open to very serious objection by anybody having the flimsiest pretensions to democracy.</P>
      <P>When this city management system was first brought under the notice of the Dáil by way of a Bill it foisted on the City of Cork a system and a City Manager which have proved both irksome, obnoxious and provocative.  At the time of the passing of the Cork City Management Bill through this House I endeavoured to make that Bill less unacceptable to the citizens of Cork than it was in its original shape. Notwithstanding the endeavours I made by way of attempting to amend that Bill to render it less unacceptable to the people of Cork, and notwithstanding similar endeavours by Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches, we were beaten in divisions by the Cumann na nGaedheal machine.  I very much regret, indeed, to say that in the Cumann na nGaedheal lobbies on these occasions we found representatives from other parts of Cork outside the city who proclaimed, who have continued and who will continue to proclaim, when they get back to their constituents, their non-belief in measures of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that they trooped into the Lobby obeying the Whip of the Cumann na nGaedheal machine.  On the occasion of the passage of the Cork City Management Bill through this House I endeavoured to secure more power for the members of the municipal body and to curtail, as far as possible and practicable, the reserved functions of the City Manager.  The result of all this legislation, so far as Cork City is concerned, is that it has given unlimited power to the City Manager, and taken every vestige of power or control from the elected representatives of the people.  The people of Cork, with their usual taste, and with their usual sense of discipline in these matters, said they would give the Act a trial.  They have done so, and in every department of municipal government that Act has been found wanting.  I want to say here at this juncture, in relation to the composition of the Cork City Council, that it is composed, in the main, of members of the Business or Commercial Party, a few of the Fianna Fáil Party, and at least one or two more of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. There are only two official Labour representatives on that Board.  I also want to say that as a result of having given that system a fair trial quite recently a motion was adopted which practically meant the dissolution of Cork City Council, or an end to its policy, if you like to read it that way.  That motion was moved by a member of the Executive of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in Cork, who is an ex-T.D., namely, Mr. Liam de Roiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask members of Cumann na nGaedheal in this House are they prepared to follow along the line of the Cork City Executive, which, I understand, is the head Executive for Munster, or are they prepared to go into the Lobbies here and stand up to honest criticism when they come back to their constituents and not run away from it?  This impasse I have just mentioned was reached quite recently in Cork, when it was <Col N="1051" /> decided by a majority of 14 to 4 that they could no longer continue to act as a Council, on account of the Mussolini-like tactics of the City Manager, who, let me say, was not acting contrary to the law as indicated in the Cork City Management Act.  He certainly, however, did not act up to the spirit of the measure, as many of us contemplated it, when the Bill was passing through the House.  That all goes to show the very grave danger of entrusting so much power in one man's hands.</P>
    <P>If any proof is required of the dictatorship that exists in Cork City, one or two instances should alone suffice.  Recently the Cork City Manager had a trade dispute with some of the building operatives engaged on Corporation work, and because they would not accommodate the City Manager in some way or another, a strike or a lock-out took place, call it what you like, but it was an industrial dispute of some kind, because of the dissatisfaction of the City Manager with one section of the building trade, namely, the plasterers.  This lock-out or industrial trouble developed until nearly every building operative in the employment of the Cork City Council was involved.  By way of reprisal&mdash;I can call it nothing else&mdash; the City Manager adopted Black-and-Tan methods&mdash;and I can call them by no other name&mdash;of endeavouring to inflict hardship on the section of the community which could least afford it, namely, the old persons who had been pensioned by the Corporation of Cork long before the City Manager came into the city. He withheld the pensions of the old labourers and other pensioners of the Corporation for a number of days.  Perhaps it was owing to pressure from Dublin or pressure from Cork, or perhaps from both places combined that he relented.  He relented and very graciously restored the pensions of the labourers.  Surely this was a wonderful act of generosity on the part of the City Manager to restore the pensions which had been granted by those who preceded the City Manager in <Col N="1052" /> office!  Surely a wonderful act of generosity coming from one of the Mussolinis of the Local Government Department!</P>
    <P>The vindictiveness went further than that, because it was not with the labourers the first dispute took place.  It was owing to the unwillingness of the tradesmen or the mechanics to agree with the City Manager as to how certain work should be done.  I want the House to mark and digest this piece of Black-and-Tan tactics.  He restored the pensions of the labourers, but he absolutely refused to restore the pensions of the artisans and tradesmen who had been pensioned by the Corporation.  I ask any member of Cumann na nGaedheal, I ask the Minister for Local Government, and I ask President Cosgrave, whom I know to be a very humane man&mdash;I know President Cosgrave had no responsibility for that class of conduct and I know he would not acquiesce in that class of conduct, but I have grave doubts as to the complicity and the guilt of the Minister for Local Government in one of the most dastardly things that ever was done in Cork by one of the puppets of the Local Government Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the same time I think the Deputy should confine himself to showing the defects of the Cork Act rather than involving us in a discussion about a trade dispute in Cork or a dispute between the Council and the Manager or the Council and the Minister, because a discussion on the principles of this Bill should not be diverted.</P>

      <P>Innocuous.  I submit I am entitled, with your permission, to discuss the Bill as I have been discussing it, because if there is anything useful in its application to the measure we are now discussing, it is a question of precedent, and I want to establish the fact that the precedent set up in Cork is a bad one from whatever point of view you wish to look at it.  It has had very disastrous results as far as Cork City is concerned.  I was proceeding to relate some of the activities, or perhaps the proclivities, of the City Manager, all of which he is entitled to do under the terms of the Act. The reason I mention this is because I anticipate that in a very short time we will have a very big volume of public opinion in Cork making representations perhaps to the Ministry for an amending Bill to the Cork City Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government in his interruption asked that I should indicate some of the things that the Cork Corporation wanted. I indicated that when the City Management Bill was going through the Dáil particularly in regard to what are known as the reserved functions. I notice that the reserved functions under the Greater Dublin Bill are somewhat akin to the reserved functions of the City Manager of Cork.  I want to know amongst the reserved functions is it part of the <Col N="1055" /> reserved functions of the coming City Manager under this Bill, or will he be enabled as the Cork City Manager has apparently been enabled, to use the Rotary Club as a platform for an indictment and a vitriolic attack on organised labour not only in the city but throughout the country?  Again I want to know was it contemplated as one of the reserved functions of the Cork City Manager that he should be enabled to withhold the pensions of those who were pensioners before the Manager came to Cork City?  The Minister for Local Government said that in Cork they attempted to provide a city council with an executive and an administrative side.  I want to know from the Minister under which head or caption will he place the action of the City Manager, deliberative or administrative, where he disallowed the pensions, or again under which head will he place the Manager's action at the Rotary Club when he delivered his diatribe against Cork Trade Unions and Cork customs and traditions in general.</P>
    <P>I do know that even on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches where we rarely hear anything educative or interesting, there are many Deputies who, at the same time as voting for this Cork City Management Bill, may perhaps by the same machine-like methods be probably persuaded, if not gagged into submission, to vote for this Greater Dublin Bill.  It may be that they will be led to believe that the position of the City Manager will not be analogous to that of the Cork City Manager because I know from conversations I have had with Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies that they are in principle opposed to the idea of a Manager as they were opposed to the Manager in the case of that terrible travesty of autonomy for Cork known as the Cork City Management Bill.</P>
    <P>The position as I have already said, in Cork, as far as any powers suggested by the Minister for Local Government in his introductory speech yesterday where he made some passing references to Cork, is that it is found in <Col N="1056" /> practice that the City Manager has acted and is continuing to act in direct opposition to the expressed will of the people as represented by the City Council.  I am an advocate of the ballot box as against any other method of ascertaining the will of the people, but here you have a concrete case in the City of Cork where the will of the people was expressed through the ballot boxes, where a large number of commercial men were elected, where a number of people who called themselves Cumann na nGaedheal were elected, and where a number of Fianna Fáil representatives and two Labour representatives were elected.  When these elected representatives of the people voiced their sentiments or the wishes of the people, the City Manager refused to accede to them. I want to say here that he is still acting well within his legal rights but he is not acting up to the spirit of the Act such as we anticipated he would, in Cork.</P>
    <P>A very serious flaw in this Greater Dublin Bill is the flaw which exists also in the Cork City Management Act.  I refer to the section relating to the City Manager's authority over the Town Clerk.  It was quite news to me recently to be told&mdash;and I speak subject to the correction of the Minister&mdash;that it is no longer the custom to have the minutes of the Cork Corporation submitted to the Local Government Department for revision or review.  Apparently, I must be correct because the Minister's silence gives consent.  In the worst days of British rule, it was customary for the minutes of all these bodies to be sent up to the Local Government Board to be examined and criticised.  The custom that existed in the time of John Bull does not, I understand, obtain now. The minutes of the proceedings of the Cork Corporation are not at all brought under the review of the Minister. That is by information and I speak subject to correction.  That is why I suggest that it is not a good thing that the Town Clerk should be under the direct control of and subject to the City Manager <Col N="1057" />&mdash;subject to being dismissed by the City Manager if he chooses to dismiss him.</P>
    <P>Why I say that that is not a good thing in the Greater Dublin Bill is this: We all know that the recording of minutes can be brought to a fine art.  It is quite easy to write up minutes to suit either one party or another in any public body.  As I am reminded, it has been frequently done.  In order to safeguard the public of Dublin, as the unfortunate public of Cork are not safeguarded, I would suggest that even if the Minister has to force this Bill through with his machined majority, he will consider the advisability of removing control over the Town Clerk by the City Manager.  Somebody has said that minutes can be reduced to seconds or increased to hours.  It is quite easy for any young boy with a mere elementary education, and if he is as alert as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to fake minutes.  I have already told the House that dissatisfaction with the operation of the Cork City Management Act and the dissatisfaction and chagrin of the citizens with the activities of the Manager under that Act, who was specially named by the Minister, culminated in a strike of the members of the Corporation, all of whom, except two, are members of other Parties than the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am wondering as to some things that have occurred in this State of ours.  I am wondering as to the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  We find in Northern Ireland that the Government, when scrapping the Proportional Representation system, introduced a Bill containing property qualifications.  Are we to understand that in matters of this kind it is the fixed policy of the Government here to imitate slavishly what is done in Britain and Northern Ireland?  In the matters that really concern the ordinary lives of the common people&mdash;the questions of social legislation, such as increasing the old age pension or reducing the age at which one can become pensionable, giving pensions to widows and orphans, and all those <Col N="1058" /> matters which, after all, are the things that really matter in the workaday lives of the people of this nation&mdash;are we not to copy them? We slavishly copy the re-establishment of privileged classes in this country because it has been done in Northern Ireland.  But are we not to copy and emulate in some way the decent social legislation that is in operation in Northern Ireland and England, too?  Oh, no!  So long as the administration of this class of legislation is in the hands of the ex-brass hats, the military-minded persons, so long will this country have to submit to this jack-booting and sabre rattling of the ex-generals and the ex-brigadiers and the ex-colonels who are as numerous in this country as in America after the Civil War.</P>
    <P>The theorising of the Minister may appear all right on paper.  The peroration of the Minister as to the wonderful things that were to accrue from this most wonderful of all measures did possess all the merits of a sixth-form schoolboy. The Bill has been condemned from all Benches in this House, as I understand and as I saw demonstrated a few moments ago by one of the Independent Deputies, Deputy J.X. Murphy.  The Minister speaks of experts in municipal matters.  The common or garden people who hitherto managed the affairs of the council of, say, Ballymacpunk, will find that they must have over them one of these supermen from Dublin, some camp follower or carpet-bagger who must be rewarded with office, some gentleman who was hiding his skin safely in a back room or in an office in a front street with the title of I.O.&mdash; a name that was otherwise interpreted as Intelligence Officer&mdash;some of those gentlemen who never hurt their skins and never intended to hurt their skins, but who urged the little boys and the young men of Ireland to go out and murder one another.  These are the people to be rewarded under this Bill and under the other Bills that have passed through this House from time to time.  We come to the persons who <Col N="1059" /> went into the Civil Service by Civil Service examinations.  We got that privilege when John Bull was here. But we get these people now at the bottom of the ladder, and we have the supermen &mdash; the Intelligence Officer who was a colonel or brigadier, I forget most of their titles. We have this Bill and the other Acts suggesting that experts should be sent to those cities and towns to teach the local people how to manage their own affairs.  When the Minister is replying I want to know from him what he means by &ldquo;expert&rdquo;?  Let the Minister first define the word &ldquo;expert.&rdquo;  Having defined the word, let us have some idea as to the claims of the people whom he has in his mind as experts. Let us have some idea as to what are the claims that they possess to be termed &ldquo;expert.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am rather dubious about the Minister's interpretation of common or garden English having regard to the experiences we have had in Cork City of the so-called experts sent down there to teach us how to manage our own affairs.  I am wondering would it be possible or would it be advisable for the Minister to look over his shoulder and to bring in some experts into the Local Government Department to teach him to be expert himself.  The Minister is an expert in depriving the citizens of this State of the ordinary liberty of the subject to which they had been entitled even under British rule.  If the Minister's definition or idea of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; means the person whom he has sent down to manage the affairs of the municipality of Cork, then I would suggest a new national anthem to the persons of this nation and particularly to the Deputies in this House.  That anthem would be &ldquo;God save Ireland from the experts.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill there are several considerations that should be borne in mind by the House.  The first consideration is that there is a clear and definite demand from the people of Dublin City for the re-establishment of the <Col N="1060" /> Dublin Corporation.  The second is that that Corporation should be run upon economic and sound business lines.  The people of Dublin want an efficient and business-like council. There can be no disputing the fact that the people of this city have an inalienable right to control their own municipal affairs.  Municipal bodies have always been regarded as the training school for higher political activities among people throughout the country.  The Local Government (Dublin) Bill should conform to these two principles.  It should, if possible, create a sound civic spirit among the citizens and it should create pride in the capital of the country.  It should also, if possible, develop the mental capacity and the efficiency of the individual.  The worth of the State is summed up in the worth of the individual.  If you dwarf the men of the city you dwarf the men of the State itself; if you have petty men in the city you will always have a petty State.  It should be the main object of this House to conform to the wishes of the people of Dublin.  The Government must recognise the fact that there is among the people of Dublin a desire for the restoration of the Dublin Corporation.  That Corporation, when it is set up, should not be a Corporation of marionettes.</P>

    <P>Sir,&mdash;As a citizen of Dublin, unconnected with any political Party, I desire to enter my protest against the latest attempt to destroy civic spirit among Dubliners and to enthrone reaction in the measure proposed for the local government of Dublin. Citizens of every Party who love this old city must indeed feel angry with the minds that conceived this measure.  No Dubliner or friend of Dublin could recommend such a measure as this. <Col N="1061" /> As one of your constituents, I ask you to use your influence against the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That letter is typical of many I have received.  In criticising this Bill, I will not go the length to which my friends on the Opposition Benches have gone in their criticisms.  Deputy Lemass asks one very pertinent question.  He asked: What have the City Commissioners done for Dublin city?  Any business man who knows anything about the affairs of the city is aware that the Commissioners have done excellent work.  They have removed the old stigma, &ldquo;dirty Dublin,&rdquo; and in doing so they have saved something like £30,000 per annum to the ratepayers. They have reduced the rates from 22/6 to 14/8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, with all respect to the Chair, that the administration which will shortly come to an end will be more or less incorporated in and duplicated by this Bill, and if one is to discuss the merits or demerits of the Bill it is almost unavoidable to make reference to the work of the City Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has been so ruled as one who sits on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches it is not my duty to say that the Ceann Comhairle is wrong.  As far as the City Commissioners are concerned they are excellent departmental heads, and as such they have proved their worth.  The whole kernel of the question lies in the complete absence of power of the city council which this Bill proposes to set up. Section 50 of the Bill deals with the powers of the City Manager. One very important portion of that <Col N="1062" /> section states that he may do all such matters and things, including the making of contracts for and on behalf of the corporation, as may be necessary, and he may accept on his own initiative any contracts whether the tender be the highest or lowest. Section 55 adds to these powers, and it says that every act or thing done or decision taken by the Manager which, if done or taken by the council of a county or other borough or an urban district, would be required by law to be done or taken by resolution of such council, shall be done or taken by the Manager by an order in writing signed by him and containing a statement of the time at which it was so signed.  What is the meaning of these two sections combined? They give the Manager practically autocratic power in the control of the affairs of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>There is even a considerable difficulty in removing the Manager from office.  If, as could happen, a dud Manager was appointed, the greatest difficulty would exist before that dud Manager could be removed.  If the Minister decides, after he has been petitioned by the council that the Manager should be removed from office, that he should not be removed, that is an end of it as far as the city council and the other council proposed under this Bill are concerned. In another section the Bill sets out that the Manager shall advise and assist the council in the exercise and performance of its reserved functions. Under Section 28 all and every of the powers, functions and duties shall become the powers, functions and duties of the city corporation. That sounds exceedingly well until one goes to another sub-section in that particular section which effectively and deliberately wipes out the functions and powers of the city council itself.  Sub-section (7) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All and every of the powers, functions, and duties of the city corporation shall be exercised and performed for and on behalf of the city corporation by the city council or the city manager (as the case <Col N="1063" /> may require) subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>Here is a section that apparently makes co-equal the powers of the City Manager and the powers of the city council.  But there are other provisions in the Bill which negative and wipe out this co-equality.  What are the provisions of the Bill, and what are the respective powers of the two main parties that will function under the greater Dublin Bill, the City Manager and the city council? I think it would be wise if, for a moment we examined exactly what powers are entrusted to the City Manager under the Bill.  There are about twelve reserved functions given to the city council.  There is the striking of a rate.  No one will deny the importance of that.  There is the borrowing of money necessary to run the corporation.  No one will deny that that is exceedingly important. Then we come to the rest. What are they?  The amending of bye-laws; the making operative of any enactment and applying it to the city council; powers to deal with Section 5 of the Shops Act; power to promote legislation; power of election to public bodies; power to confer the freedom of the city and the determination of the Lord Mayor's salary.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two things the striking of a rate and the borrowing of money for the city council, what other powers or duties will this new corporation possess?  In effect what are these powers?  Once the rate has been struck, and, once the money has been provided, what control in law has the city council over the conduct of the City Manager?  You have here, in black and white, the legal powers.  What are the legal powers of the city council itself in comparison with the power of the City Manager?  If the Manager decides that that money shall be spent in a certain way, that is the end of it.  There is no controlling power exercised by the council on the City Manager as to how the money shall be spent, or how in their discretion <Col N="1064" /> they may think it should be spent. We have been told that the city council has the power of the purse. Well, the power of the purse is confined to two things and two things only, the striking of the rate, shall I say the finding of the money for the Manager to go ahead with anything he needs, and the raising of a loan. Once a loan has been raised what power has the Council under the Bill in controlling the expenditure of that loan?  Here in black and white they have no legal power whatever.  As far as I can see if this Bill passes unamended in this House the main function of the new corporate body will be to find the money for the Manager and to permit him to do the rest.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House that the council will deal with local problems of every kind, but we have here set down in black and white the exact control that the council will exercise on the one hand, and the exact control that the City Manager will exercise on the other hand.  I challenge the Minister to say, apart from these negligible reserved functions, leaving out the two functions that I admit are important&mdash;the power to strike a rate and the power to borrow money&mdash;what other functions have the new city council to discharge? As far as I can see, once the council strikes a rate for the current year they can take a holiday for the next twelve months.  I do not believe the citizens of Dublin want a corporation of the type set out in the Bill.  The Minister for Education stated that the principal business of the council will be the development of the city.  That is a thing with which every honest man will agree, but I state emphatically that the council has no power of development under this Bill.  What control has the council over town planning?  The Minister referred to that fact.  He pointed out that he would have to have a definite conception of what town planning means, and that then, at some future date, perhaps at Tibb's Eve, certain heads of various Departments, or various councils, the Lord Mayor and one or two others, might form a council to deal <Col N="1065" /> with that particular aspect of the question.  What is the good of sending a council into the council chamber of the city if they have no control over the town planning of the city?  On the facts pointed out by the Minister, there was a clear admission that they possess no such powers.  If the council want to extend the boundaries of the city, what powers do they possess under the Bill?  Are they free agents?  The power conferred by the Bill is simply the right to apply to the Minister for Local Government for permission to extend the boundaries.  Is that any real power; is it any power that self-respecting men would exercise? If the council, for instance, demanded payment of the £30,000 which the Electricity Supply Board have not paid to the city, could it force the Minister to demand such payment?  I say, as a matter of law, it could not.  I agree with what Deputy O'Connell stated, that the people should be in complete control of the City Manager, and not the City Manager in complete control of the people.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one born and bred in the City of Dublin, and having a pride in the city, I feel that what is written across the face of this Bill is distrust in the citizens.  The old corporation, when the struggle for national independence was taking place, played no mean part in the success of that struggle.  The President, of whom we are all proud, was one of the foremost men in that successful struggle, and I suggest to him, with all respect, that the citizens of Dublin deserve a better Bill than the one that now lies before the House.</P>
    <P>If one considers the various sections of the Bill, one can only come to the one conclusion: that the City Manager is practically omnipotent, and that the city council has really little or no powers outside the two I referred to.  I am of opinion that if the people of this city are entrusted with the election of paid representatives, in common with the rest of the country, to this House, they are equally well qualified to elect proper representatives to carry on municipal government, and I <Col N="1066" /> would remind the House that the franchise exercised for the election of members of the council of the City of Dublin is a much more limited franchise than that exercised by those who elect Deputies.  You have a much more responsible electorate dealing with the members that will be elected to the council.  Surely the task of election enshrined in this Bill of sending proper members to represent them in the new corporation is not a task beyond the powers and the intelligence of the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister put his finger on the core of the whole problem involved in this Bill when he said that there should be a separation of the deliberative and the administrative functions.  But he knocked the bottom out of the main sections of the Bill when he added that executive and administrative affairs should be entrusted to a single official.  If you are going to entrust both administrative and executive functions to a single official why elect a corporation at all?  What are the functions of the corporation?</P>
    <P>Everyone admits that there is need for an alert administrative officer at the head of the Dublin Corporation. Everyone admits that a sound, businesslike corporation is vital to the City of Dublin and to the interests of the ratepayers.  I stand for the fullest powers of administration being given to the Manager, but I stand, on the other hand, for the fullest possible executive powers being given to the council.  It is a difficult thing to differentiate between administrative and executive powers, and play has been made here of that difficulty.  Any man who has acquaintance with law knows that there is scarcely a scintilla of difference between what is termed an executor and what is termed an administrator.  These functions do exist, and the differentiation between them is of over-riding importance.  I suggest to the framers of this Bill, who have all the machinery at their disposal, that there should be no difficulty whatever in satisfactorily differentiating between the administrative and the executive functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> One has in the composition of this House an absolute model of what should be embodied in the Bill.  We have the Executive Council.  They are responsible for the executive policy of the country.  They have the fullest possible powers of initiative. They have power to plan and to devise national development.  They are, in a word, a creative force. That is the function of any executive, and in this Bill, such a function should be given to the city council which will be set up, if one is to be set up.  We have, on the other hand, the administrative arm here, represented in the Civil Service, which carries out the policy and the wishes of the Executive.  Now, there is no need to make play on words in discussing this Bill. There are two clear functions that have got to be carried out by the new corporation, if that new corporation is to be set up.  One is executive and the other is administrative. I say that the City Manager should be given the fullest possible administrative power.  Give him complete control over appointments.  Do not leave open the only thing upon which the old Dublin Corporation could be criticised&mdash;jobbery and accusations of councillors finding jobs for their friends.  If you give him this power, you give him a very effective power, a power which will be in the interests of the citizens. But if in addition to giving him administrative power you also give him executive power, power such as the creative power possessed by the Executive Council here, then there is very little use in setting up a corporation, because, as I have said, it will only be a corporation of marionettes.</P>
    <P>Considering the so-called reserved services and contrasting them with the powers of municipal councils in other countries, one can only come to the conclusion that there must be amendments made in the provisions with regard to the functions of the city council.  If one went to the Mayor of a German city and asked him: &ldquo;What are your municipal functions?&rdquo; he would reply: &ldquo;We can do almost anything.&rdquo;  It is the <Col N="1068" /> policy there to put the fullest possible powers, financial and otherwise, into the hands of the municipal council.  Municipal bodies in most of the larger towns abroad carry on savings banks and pawnshops, they finance building societies, conduct mortgage banks for the purpose of advancing money to landowners and builders to develop property, act as the legal friends of poor law children, they control housing, give legal advice and information respecting house building, carry on unemployment insurance schemes and fire insurance and trading enterprises on a wide scale.  Such a programme of duties and functions in Continental cities goes far beyond the narrow principles that are enshrined in this Bill.  If this be a progressive measure, if the interests of the City of Dublin are to be consulted in the framing of the provisions contained in the Bill, I say that the citizens of Dublin are entitled to just as wide powers in the exercise of their franchise and in the exercise of their rights in the city council as in the case of any foreign city.</P>
    <P>If one considers this aspect of the question as it should be considered&mdash; from a purely business point of view &mdash;what should be the proper functions of the council and of the Manager?  The city council, acting as businessmen, in my opinion, should be the directors of Dublin City, with full executive powers. Their authority in all matters of policy should be just as wide as the authority exercised in Continental cities, and they should be just as independent of the Manager as the Manager should be independent of them in the discharge of his administrative functions.  Will any businessman in this House contend for a single moment that if he were a director of a firm he would entrust the same powers to his Manager as are proposed to be entrusted to the City Manager?  This superman has been ridiculed and, in my opinion, ridiculed with some show of justice from the Labour benches.  I am not a believer in supermen: in this generation there has only been one, and that is Mussolini.  That may not <Col N="1069" /> be palatable to my friends on the Labour benches, nevertheless it is undeniably true.  I have no fault, good, bad or indifferent, to find with the work of the Commissioners, which I am not allowed to discuss on this Bill.  They were three excellent Department heads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Or indirectly.  I will only say that the municipal council has been departmentalised, and any man with business training knows that that is the first essential for the running of any concern, whether it be a municipal or a private concern, to ensure efficiency and success.  But what is the function of the directorate? The function of the directorate is to plan policy, to be given a complete position of initiative, to regulate the financial policy, to have complete and continuous control over matters pertaining to finance.  Under this Bill, once the rate is struck and once the money is placed in the hands of the Manager, the council will have absolutely no further control.  I would have been in complete agreement with the Minister had he said: &ldquo;Give the City Manager full administrative power over everything connected with the city,&rdquo; but I do suggest, with all respect, speaking from this side of the House, that the citizens of Dublin would never agree to admit the right or the justice of such a claim as has been made in this House under the powers that this Bill intends to confer on the Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated that if you give full administrative powers to the Manager you prevent anything in the nature of corruption or jobbery, you prevent any jobs being found for the friends of councillors, and that was the main difficulty with the old Dublin Corporation.  As a Dublin man, I was glad to hear the admission in this debate that the old Dublin Corporation was not corrupt. <Col N="1070" /> I have had experience of corporations not alone on this side, but across the water, and I have found considerably more corruption and inefficiency in corporations across the Channel than ever existed in the old Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect the House ought to consider.  If this Bill passes in its present form there can be only one result, and that is, that a bitter party fight will be waged in municipal politics.  The Opposition Party, if the information I have been given is correct, are already prepared. Would it be in the interests of the city that such a party fight should be introduced into municipal politics? The limited powers in this Bill can be very effectively used by any party that will be able to obtain a majority in the new Corporation. If Fianna Fáil obtain control in the new Corporation, they are absolutely opposed to this Bill and there are certain rights embodied in this Bill which can be exercised to the tremendous detriment of the citizens of Dublin.  Suppose a Lord Mayor is elected under this Bill who does not agree with the principles contained in it, what would follow?  That Lord Mayor, if he wants to set himself up as an opponent of this Bill, can hold up the whole municipal life of the city.  He can refuse his signature to any money order that the City Manager may issue.  We have been informed by Deputy Anthony that the Cork Corporation have refused to strike a municipal rate.  Exactly the same state of affairs can be brought about in Dublin if this Bill passes through the House unamended.  Does any Deputy, whether he belongs to the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil Party, or Cumann na nGaedheal Party wish to see such a political atmosphere created after the setting up of the new Dublin Corporation?  Should it not be the aim and the object of every party to give the new Corporation every possible facility to make it a good and efficient Corporation?  We have been told by Deputy Anthony that there is an impasse at present in Cork; that by fourteen votes to four <Col N="1071" /> Cork Corporation have refused to strike a rate.  Do we wish to have a repetition of that in Dublin?  I live amongst the people and earn my bread amongst them, and I can say that there is more feeling engendered against this Bill than possibly those sitting on this side of the House realise. There is a feeling engendered against the Bill amongst those who are the strongest possible supporters of the Government Party, and I think it is my duty to make it clear that such a feeling exists.</P>
    <P>As to the coastal borough, I am in complete agreement with the Minister. I think he made out an absolutely sound case for the policy he is pursuing in that particular direction.  The argument that he put forward in support of the coastal borough satisfied me that it was quite a sound and economic provision, especially the statement that no advantage could possibly accrue to Dublin City from the incorporation of Dun Laoghaire and these other townships.  He made it clear that as far as the ratepayers of Dublin are concerned it would not mean the saving of a halfpenny in the rates. That was quite sufficient for me as representing the Dublin ratepayers. The Minister also made it clear that whereas there could be no possible saving in the rates there might be a considerable increase so far as the Dublin citizens were concerned.  He pointed out that those outside districts, if they were brought in, would be looking for new roads, new drainage schemes and things of that kind.  He made a further statement that a satisfactory price is being paid, and will continue to be paid, for the water supplied to outside districts. I should like the Minister to re-examine that question.  If my information is correct, the citizens of Dublin, when everything is taken into account, are really losing in respect of the sums they are receiving for supplying this water.  It is not my intention to pit my knowledge against that of the Minister, but I am informed that water is <Col N="1072" /> being supplied to the outside districts by Dublin City at a loss.</P>
    <P>With regard to the great bone of contention on the Labour Benches, as to giving the commercial element a certain vote under this Bill, I always understood that the basic principle governing the granting of a franchise could be summed up in a very few words: If there is taxation there must be representation.  When the Dublin Poor Law Relief Bill was passing through the House I contended that the greater part of the burden imposed by that measure would be thrown upon the commercial community in Dublin.  The Minister introducing the Bill confirmed that statement to the letter. He stated that the old valuation of Dublin City brought in £1,227,683, and that out of that valuation the commercial community paid on their business premises the huge sum of £628,847.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that the business community were assessed on that valuation.  To put the thing in a nutshell, it means that the commercial community contribute more than fifty per cent. of the rates.  Yet, if the Labour Party are to have their way, the commercial community are practically to have no vote so far as the municipal body is concerned.</P>

Therefore it is absolutely right and necessary, and I think the Government is thoroughly justified in giving commercial firms a small representation. Deputy Anthony talked about the man who had exercised fourteen hundred votes.  Four or six is the maximum that is to be given to any firm under this Bill.  Will Deputy Anthony suggest that Messrs.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is well able to speak for himself.  I am not responsible for the utterances of the Minister.  Can any man who looks at this from a broadminded aspect&mdash;leaving this reactionary talk about democracy and all that, which in the main is eyewash&mdash;contend that four votes given to the most important employers of labour in the City of Dublin is going to inflict any hardship upon municipal representation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of contracts, I am in complete agreement that the City Manager, when appointed, should in the future, as under the old Corporation, have the right of acceptance or refusal of those contracts, but there is one amendment that I would like to see embodied in that particular section of the Bill.  Under this Bill, the City Manager can accept any tender, whether it is the highest or the lowest.  I think it would be wise, and in the interests of the city, where a tender that is not the lowest is accepted by the City Manager, that it should be his duty to report to the council the reason for the acceptance of that tender.  He should set out, if he does accept other than the lowest tender offered, that he had sound business reasons for taking that line of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, I think, said that it would be the wish of almost all parties in this House to see as full a representation of city interests as possible.  Now, under the Bill, what interests will be returned; what chance will the ordinary individual, who wants to stand on his own feet, have in fighting a municipal election? What will the cost of a municipal election be to the ordinary individual who stands for election under this Bill as framed?  The whole area is to be divided into three divisions.  Any man who has any experience of this House knows how <Col N="1075" /> costly is even the mere printing of ordinary cards to send to each voter in order to let his candidature be known.  I ask the Minister if it would not be possible to make the electoral areas smaller than those in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister can do this without allowing to come into play any of the old ward abuses with which we are all familiar.  I hope the Minister, when he is finally shaping the measure in definite form, will consider kindly the suggestions which I put before the House.  As far as the Bill is concerned, it is undoubtedly a progressive measure, but it is a progressive measure that needs amendment.  If common ground of agreement can be reached, as far as this House is concerned, to equalise the powers of the city council and the powers of the City Manager, I have no doubt whatever that this can be made an excellent Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFrench1927" hpid="Mr. French Mr. French">
      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>In intervening in this debate, the only intention I have is to offer suggestions, judging Dublin from without.  That is the only experience that I can claim in regard to Dublin.  In endeavouring to improve even slightly this Dublin Bill, I shall try to give the House some idea of the working of a smaller measure of a similar kind in the City of Cork.  I am perfectly certain the more publicity this Bill gets throughout Ireland and the more publicity given to the debate on the Second Reading the better.  I am certain the public were never more disappointed than they were by the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister for Local Government, when introducing a similar measure for Cork, twelve months ago, said it was purely an experimental measure.  If the Minister was sincere in that statement, he should certainly have given some recognition to the criticism of the measure working in Cork, and should have altered this Dublin Bill, because the introduction of this Bill now, without some such change, is recognised throughout the country as an effort to stabilise the system that prevails in Cork.  I can see no other reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> In moving the Second Reading last night, the Minister said there was no proposal submitted to himself or his Department about any changes that were required in the City of Cork measure.  I do not think there is another member of the House ignorant of the fact that there has hardly been one day throughout the whole existence of the City of Cork Act that it has not been seriously criticised, and particularly in the past three months.  It has been broadcast right throughout this country within the last two months that there was not an existing member of a borough council who would stand over the Act.  Really, these two measures, to my mind, are hallmarked with the seal of permanent officialdom, and the Bill apparently is drafted to protect the existence of an individual who is libelled by the name of manager and who has nothing else than the same uncontrolled authority of a permanent official.  If the Minister for Local Government had the experience of some of his colleagues in public administration he would have profited anyway to the extent that he would not make some of the statements he has made in favour of this Bill. For instance, in connection with the question of authority, public representatives in either the Dublin or the Cork Bill have authority only at their rates meetings.  Immediately that rates meeting is over, the only decent thing the Dublin representatives could do under this Bill would be to refrain from attending any meeting until that day twelvemonth. They have no other function.</P>
    <P>Before going into the Cork Bill as I see it, I would like to say that the Government, in the establishment of the commissioner system, has rallied around them a Press in Ireland who have been most disrespectful to public representation.  The Press in Ireland, since the advent of commissioners, have published articles and reports of meetings absolutely untrue in order to vilify public representation and to foist commissioners on people.  I have listened in Dublin to a statement made by a very old <Col N="1077" /> member of the Dublin Corporation, where he proved in figures that there was no financial saving in substituting commissioners for the Dublin Corporation.  The same situation exists in Cork.</P>
    <P>In October, 1924, corporation rates were 20s. 1d.  At that time the borough council in Cork struck their rates in two half yearly instalments. On the striking of the second half contracts were opened for cartage under the improvement rate and tenders accepted and on the accepted ones a difference of sevenpence in the £ on the rates was shown.  After striking the half year's rate and before the corporation was dissolved there was a further saving on the cartage under the sanitary or public health rate to the extent roughly of ninepence or tenpence.  If you take that off you will find that the rates during the commissioner time were on a par with the rates struck by the old corporation.  In addition to that the capital debt in Cork has been considerably increased.  The created services rendered by the commissioner were rendered through the granting of sums of money by the Government to the commissioner which were not given, with the exception of one instance, to the representatives of the borough council that was dissolved.</P>

      <P>I can make no reference to its compatriot.  Well then I will leave it, but coming back to the Dublin Bill my first objection, as a Dublin man, would be to the creation of two boroughs within the one county.  It may be argued that working that whole seafront would be too large for one borough area.  I wonder what is the great anxiety, for instance, to take in a big area in north Dublin.  I could only see one reason.  That would be confined to the coastline around the north of Dublin.  I think the development of Dublin from the industrial and services <Col N="1078" /> point of view will be confined towards the south or south east around Dun Laoghaire.  Within twenty years there has been a considerable advance in overseas trade in this country and an advance in one particular matter that to my mind will jeopardise Dublin and, in fact, most of our cities.  The overseas trade now is being carried on by ships of a greater tonnage and larger draught and to attempt to maintain a river that will give access to these ships of modern development will need continual dredging.</P>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubt but that the elected representatives of Dun Laoghaire in the future will develop their harbour to compete so successfully against Dublin that there is a day in the future when Dublin will be a village and Dun Laoghaire will be the city.  They are getting the status of a borough. With that beautiful seafront and with not too large an expenditure they are placed admirably for it. They have the railway and they will compete and drive out of existence in the future the City of Dublin. Again in creating two boroughs you are duplicating departments, you are duplicating officials, you are duplicating accounts and audits and I think if all those expenses are looked into you are facing a very formidable sum to be borne by both boroughs, when you could do it fifty per cent. less by one borough levying over the whole area.  Again my second very serious objection is to the register of the commercial electorate. I was listening to Deputy Byrne and whilst there was a lot of sense in some of his arguments I think he forgot one great fact&mdash;the real ratepayer.  Is there any individual who is going to claim his vote under this commercial register, except a few property owners, who does not in the course of his business include in his gross profit every halfpenny of rates he pays in the city? He will have his net profit, he will hold it and possibly invest it outside this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy to say that the smaller <Col N="1079" /> ratepayers will get representation under that particular clause of the Bill and they considerably outnumber in the definite count the larger ratepayers in the franchise under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFrench1927" hpid="Mr. French Mr. French">
      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I was not dealing with the ratepayer but with the masses of the people who are disfranchised. Under the Local Government franchise the people who do not get votes are the people who pay rates in every city of the world. The local government register, as we know, is a qualified register, and a privileged one to an extent, embracing chiefly the householder, the property owner and the rated occupier.  Very few people get lodger votes, especially now because of the way the franchise is looked after in some of the boroughs.  In Cork, for instance, at the last municipal election, under proportional representation, you had six men of the class that you propose to give a privileged vote to under this Bill returned.  The same thing is going to happen in Dublin.  The strongest party that will be returned under the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be people representing that class, and to them you are going to add another four.  You are going to hand over the City of Dublin to a particular class, and not one member of this preferential class ever put one foot in front of another for development in this country, either nationally or industrially.  I can remember when Messrs.  Ford were first coming to Cork.  The only people who opposed their coming were prominent members of the Cork Chamber of Shipping and Commerce.  If asked that to-day they would not be able to deny it.  They left no stone unturned to prevent Messrs. Ford coming to Cork.  And they are the sort of people that you are going to get under your Dublin Bill to run the City of Dublin.  I have, perhaps, not more than ten years experience of public life, but my experience was in a time when you had to examine what you were doing. You had to understand it, and to <Col N="1080" /> take a little more responsibility than possibly you are doing now, and I must say that I have never been able to find a business man who could entirely separate himself from his own business.  In the council, or out of it, the business man is obsessed with the progress of his own particular calling.  I am not saying that that is deliberate, or that he is going to use his position for the purposes of his own business, but it is a peculiarity with him.  With him it is a kind of dog-in-the-manger policy.</P>
      <P>As was said recently in Cork by a representative of the Business Party, he had no time to devote to public affairs.  But he was there to impede somebody who would give his time unselfishly for the progress of the city.  If you hand over the City of Dublin to that class, mark you, you are sealing for good and all this Dublin measure.  The class of people that you are giving this privileged vote to are already privileged under the local government franchise. They are the people who sought to transfer government from public representatives and who will now, I am sorry to say, with Government assistance, carry on the same system, camouflaged by an election for public representatives.  To my mind, it is insulting, and a sneer at public representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give you some kind of an idea of the working out of the system in Cork, I would like to say this year, as last year, that as an individual I think the managerial system can be made ideal.  If you can create an Act that will give sufficient authority to a manager that will be consistent, we will say, with the position of a manager of any business, corporation or large commercial undertaking, you will get very near to an ideal situation, but, as you have done in Cork, under this Bill you are creating a Manager and you are not giving him the semblance of a chance to manage.  He has too much authority and, according to the Act, he must exercise it.  In exercising it, he is continually at loggerheads with public representatives. <Col N="1081" /> He must act according to every authority within the Act.  He has no choice.  From the first meeting of the borough council in Cork, under this Act, there were differences, big and small.  The members of the council thought fit at their preliminary meeting to find the means of getting the old Standing Committees of the Corporation amalgamated. After a few meetings, we decided that we would make one General Purposes Committee.  The Manager, at every one of those meetings, submitted a report on work done.  Grattan Street was surfaced, streets were swept.  We had the medical officer's report and the engineer's report.  Members went through the farce of proposing and seconding the adoption of the report, but the authority of the council was such that not one comma of the report could be altered.  If a member questioned the report, the matter wound up with the Manager saying, &ldquo;That is a function of mine.&rdquo;  The Manager was there to exercise that authority, and you can easily visualise the position of a person criticising a Manager who could tell him that he had no authority, that it was his function, and that he was going to carry it out.  Everyone of the members began to realise that there was no necessity for the meeting. There is no necessity under the Act for the actual presence of the Manager.  It was a matter of courtesy to the elected representatives that he was there at all.  I feel absolutely certain that with less authority for the Manager and more for the Council there would be more economic administration.  I would say it would be more effective and certainly would meet more with the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>I will give you one instance of where the authority lies and where the authority is embarrassing to the Manager, and I wish it to be understood that I am in no way personal towards him.  We had a big controversy at one time about the rebuilding of a bridge.  I want to give you some idea of why that was such big question in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> There are some members of this House who are aware, and others who may not be aware, that the entire river frontage in the Borough of Cork is of cut limestone.  A very charitable estimate at present would be that that would not be replaced for six million pounds.  A rather small bridge which was found to be sagging had to be rebuilt and was taken down.  The Manager had it taken down and went on with the estimate for its rebuilding.  He had the foundations laid, and then some of the members asked whether the work was to be done in concrete. The Manager said that that was the intention.  There certainly was not one individual member of the Council who did not ask the Manager to have the bridge put back in cut limestone so as not to create a patch in the limestone frontage along the city quays.  After two or three months the matter was again taken up and the Manager said that that was his function and that the Council had no authority in regard to it.  Putting in a patch like that in the beautiful frontage was a function of the Manager.  Thank God it was, because certainly I would never like to see public representatives in Cork responsible for such a dastardly outrage. Again, during that controversy there was a question addressed to the Manager to be answered by the Engineer.  His answer was not regarded as satisfactory and, in fact, it represented prominent architects in the city as being satisfied that reinforced concrete was just as good as limestone.  The Council unanimously requested the presence of the City Engineer at the following meeting, and the Manager said, with the authority of the City Management Act on his side, that since the Engineer was a subordinate officer of his he would not allow him to attend.  The Corporation of Cork, the elected representatives of the people, are not entitled to the presence at their meeting of their paid official to question him on an engineering subject, and they are prevented by the person who is <Col N="1083" /> termed the Manager of the City Council.  Surely it would be honest and decent to describe him as the dictator of the Council, for has he not the Borough Council in his pocket?</P>
    <P>The question of contracts has been mentioned by Deputy Byrne, and with that portion of his speech I have sympathy, but surely it is the right of the borough council to demand and to specify the use of Irish materials in building schemes.  Surely it is their right to say that they want such schemes carried out according to their own ideas.  As they are dealing with city property, it is the right of public representatives to specify what materials shall be used. In the first instance, take the consideration of the estimates.  What happens?  You get an abstract of accounts for last year, and in a comparative column are the estimates for the forthcoming year.  With that you get a report from the City Manager to the effect, for instance, that Rutland Street is going to be resurfaced, other streets to be repaved, and so-and-so and so-and-so. You get no details, and you have no right, within the Act, to tell your Manager that you want, for instance, Patrick Street block paved or some other street laid down in asphalt. Even if you have authority, look at what you have to do.  You are to create a policy in one night&mdash;with possibly a week's notice&mdash;which will be the policy for a year, and you have no absolute power to alter that policy from one rate meeting to another.  Who would stand up and seriously say that that is authority? Surely it would be a joke for any individual who would attempt after receiving the estimates for twelve months for the government of the city, say, on a Tuesday morning, to stand up on the following Tuesday night and criticise it fairly as the policy for the coming twelve months. If that is the definition of control of policy, I say that the Department of Local Government have not an elementary knowledge of local representation, and they should not describe it as local government.  It is not.  It is government from Dublin, <Col N="1084" /> and from the cloistered department in Dublin which, I doubt knows anything about Dublin.  Certainly they know nothing about Cork.  Within the next week we in Cork will be asked to raise a sum of money for a building scheme.  I venture to suggest that the Minister for Local Government has seen those plans, but, with the exception of myself, there is not a member of the Borough Council who has seen them.</P>

      <P>They were given no opportunity.  We need not debate that now as we will have it at a public meeting.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to state how, under the existing circumstances regarding the relations between the Manager and the council, it will be possible for the council to devise any scheme of housing or otherwise.  To give you an idea of what the people think of public representation to-day I may mention that we had a deputation quite recently in regard to the future lighting of the city.  It consisted almost solely of by-products of those privileged voters of whom in Cork we unfortunately have a big section. They sent a deputation to whom? Not to the council but to the City Manager, and they asked him to alter the whole lighting system of the city. Surely it would not be too much to ask that the people elected to represent the citizens who are footing the bill should be the authority to express the people's wishes in such matters.  Even the Manager, in answering the deputation, conveyed the intimation that he had decided upon altering the system.  There will be a very big controversy as between electricity and gas in the city of Cork.  That is a big and unnecessary responsibility to put on the Manager, and if all those responsibilities are going to be placed on his shoulders he will soon find a day in Cork when he will not be tolerated.  I can quite understand his position.  He is in <Col N="1085" /> the Act and when power is conferred on him it is his bounden duty to carry out those duties, whether he wishes to do so or not, even to flout the city council.  He is forced into that position by the authority given under the Act.  City Managers will realise that under this measure they are not compelled in any way to respect the wishes of the elected body and, if they want advice, they will have to go to the sanctuary of the Local Government Department in Dublin.  That is my personal view and I believe that I am entitled to that view owing to the working of the measure in Cork.</P>

      <P>Take again the property of the corporation.  Houses which are their property should at any rate be in the hands of the council so that they would have control of their disposal and of such matters as leases and rents.  I want to be perfectly clear on this matter. Personally I would not wish the council to have the selecting of tenants or the making of rents but I most certainly say that the property of the council is the property of the people and should be vested in the people's representatives.  I will give one instance in this regard.  There are many Deputies who know the site of the old City Hall in Cork.  It covers a large area and is a very valuable site.  I need not inform the House that if the site were built on and that side of the river developed, the value of the site would be very much enhanced.  What has happened? Right in the middle of the whole property, the manager has handed to the Cork Farmers' Union portion of the site for an abattoir at an annual rent of £1 per year.  Do not take it that I was against the granting of it, but a site for this purpose would never be granted in this particular place if the public representatives had authority to decide this question.  There was no particular reason why it should not be at the end of the property at Anglesea Street, but it is absolutely in the best situation.  That is adjacent to <Col N="1086" /> the premises of Ford's.  There is not the slightest doubt that such a thing would never have happened if you had public representatives with sufficient authority.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that effect was not given to the decision to bring in an amending Bill to the Cork Bill before the introduction of the Bill now under discussion.  I may take a certain amount of personal responsibility for that.  I was approached in November by members of the Cork business party to call a meeting of the council to transfer some of the powers of the manager to the council.  I prevailed on them at any rate to let Christmas go by in order that we could get as near as possible to a twelve months' experience of the working of the Act, so that it could not be said that we did not give the measure a fair trial. I think that anybody who has watched the situation in Cork, and I am sure the Minister must know of it, will admit that in no instance have I taken any unfair advantage to suggest changes in the Act.</P>
      <P>I certainly would not take any unfair advantage like that if there was the slightest semblance of good in the measure, and I think that can be said for almost every member of the council.  After that we got to a stage where we called our meeting and discussed the Act.  I put the question to a meeting of nineteen members of the council, including five of the Business Party, and I said: &ldquo;Before I am going any further I want one question answered: are you in favour of this Act as it stands at the moment?&rdquo; There was not a member out of the whole nineteen who did not, that night, agree that some alteration was necessary.  I am not going to say that some members would go as far as others.  I am not going to say whether I would agree with some members of the council.  I might be only prepared to go half way with them, but on the one question that was answered, you had not one member of the council who would say that he was satisfied with the Cork City Management Act as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> At the public meeting we took a vote on the proposition of a councillor, an executive member of Cumann na nGaedheal, Liam de Roiste, in the presence of his two colleagues who complete the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the Corporation.  The only excuse for a slight change of front by the Business Party was that if they had the power they would not have time to use it.  That is the mentality of the only opposition you have to changing the Act in Cork.  It is really my experience of the administration of the Business Party and of business people whom I have met in public life, that makes me object to that rather privileged register in the Dublin Bill.  I think that if business men will examine proportional representation and the privileged franchise under local government that they have received, they will admit that they have the greatest part of the power on the local government register.  Personally, for a moment I would not think of taking the control of the staff out of the hands of the City Manager.  I want him to control everything pertaining to the staff.</P>
    <P>To again get back to the question of the engineer, I think there should be some means within the Bill by which, on demand from the council, they should be entitled to ask questions of any of the heads of departments. They should be entitled to the attendance of the engineer at meetings of the council if necessary. Beyond that I would not like to see the engineer under the direct control of the council, because I recognise in him an administrative officer and a salaried administrator.  There are, perhaps, instances such as I illustrated, where he could have been questioned, and where probably he might have got the council to alter its opinion on that particular matter if he were questioned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the town clerk and to the law adviser, the more I study these two positions the more I am inclined to think that, for the efficient administration of the duties of <Col N="1088" /> their offices, they should be taken from under the authority of the Manager.  They are both in a rather peculiar position.  Under the Cork City Management Act, when the Council assembles the town clerk acts as clerk to the Council.  He is put in the invidious position that in taking the minutes of the Council he has to report, if, for instance, it became necessary for him to do so, a vote of censure on his own executive officer.  He has to report proceedings that may be considerably embarrassing to his superior officer.  I think, in fairness to the position he holds, that the town clerk should be put in a position somewhat similar to that occupied by the old town clerks.  I think their position was this: that a borough council could not dispense with their services.  The council had only power to suspend for a certain period. The sanction of the old Local Government Board had to be obtained even in the case of suspension, and they certainly could not be dismissed without the sanction of that board.</P>
    <P>The city law adviser is in a somewhat similar position to that of the town clerk.  Law at its best, particularly municipal law, is very intricate. A member of the council addresses a question to the law adviser to get his opinion on a particular matter.  I can quite see the embarrassing position the law adviser may be put in if he is asked to interpret the law on a matter in which the City Manager is involved. He is in the position that he does not know whether he ought to give his opinion on the law as he sees it, or as he thinks the Manager sees it.  I do not think that the city law adviser should be placed in such an embarrassing situation.</P>
    <P>I think, if the Minister were to get from Cork&mdash;and he can get them from his representative in Cork&mdash; some ideas as to how the Cork City Management Act has worked during the last twelve months, that he would not stand over his Dublin Bill but would seriously change it.  I am really at a loss to understand the statement that the Minister was not aware that there were going to be <Col N="1089" /> changes in the Cork Act.  The Cork City Manager makes periodical visits to the Department.  It seems incredible, therefore, that nobody in the Local Government Department would ask him how the Act was working.  I frankly admit that I prevented opposition to the working of that Act from breaking out four, five or six months ago.  I wanted to be in the position of at least getting credit for the council that they were going to work the Act unprejudiced though feeling that it would have to be amended as a result of the experience gained in working it. My attitude on that is hall-marked by the fact that Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour, Fianna Fáil, every Independent member of the Council, one member of the Business Party at the moment and the entire Business Party at one meeting, decided that the Cork City Management Act could not stand as it is. As far as the people of Cork are concerned, they are as unanimous on the rejection of that Act as it stands as they were in any phase of Cork's history.  The Cork Act will be changed, if not during the term of office of the present Minister for Local Government, then in that of his successor.</P>

      <P>After the very interesting lecture on Cork to which we have just listened, perhaps I may be permitted to say a few words with regard to Dublin.  I approach this Dublin Bill with a peculiar sense of dual responsibility, as a one hundred per cent. supporter of the Government which has introduced it and as a Deputy representing a Dublin constituency.  The debate that has taken place on the Bill so far, I followed with considerable interest. The Bill is one which essentially should be discussed in a non-party spirit, in a tone of moderation and in the spirit of improving sections in it with which we may not agree. I consider that the Bill as it stands is not only a very good Bill, but one that in every section of it gives evidence of intense thought and study. What is attempted by the Bill&mdash;no one will deny this, whether they <Col N="1090" /> agree with the Bill or not&mdash;is to make this old city a greater city than it is or than it has been.  We may differ with regard to ways and means, but I think we will all agree that that is the propelling motive behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Opposition speeches with considerable interest. I listened with particular interest to Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Lemass.  Their line of opposition to the Bill indicated that there was room for clarification in the Bill. The exchanges which took place between Deputy O'Connell and the President indicated that Deputy O'Connell did not clearly see the full possibilities of this Bill, that he did not understand the full powers of the council as outlined in it.  The debate indicated that the opposition from some quarters might, in some way, be considerably modified if some sections of the Bill were not altered but clarified and added to. The opposition to the Bill was along three main lines.  In the first place, there was opposition to the area, either as regards a few of the areas taken in to establish the coastal borough or to the direction of growth of the city; secondly, to the powers of the Manager and the powers of the council, and, thirdly, to the commercial register carrying a plural vote.  I think that both Opposition Parties concentrated mainly on these three points.  In other words, the main opposition concentrated around three sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one thing to be learned from the Opposition speeches which we have heard it is the fact that no case has been made against the further progress of the Bill.  A strong case has been made by the Opposition for the necessity of bringing this Bill to Committee.  If we oppose this Bill because we feel strongly opposed to two or three sections in it are we not putting up an unanswerable argument as to why the Bill should go to Committee?  Opposition to two or three sections and acceptance of the main principle is no justification whatever for moving the rejection of the Bill at this stage.  I feel inclined <Col N="1091" /> to suggest to Deputy O'Connell that the information which he gained during his own speech would possibly modify his objection, or his intention to vote against the further progress of this Bill towards Committee. By doing that he will not be in any way committing himself to approving of these particular sections of the Bill to which he objects, but he would be rather indicating a broad-minded spirit to discuss the Bill for what it is worth, and to discuss it in the spirit of improving it if he considers improvement is possible.</P>
    <P>If I might examine the points of opposition one by one, on the question of area exception is taken by Deputy O'Connell to the establishment of the coastal borough.  All are agreed as to the necessity of Dublin City extending, but there are points of difference with regard to direction. His main objection was to the establishment of this coastal borough.  His suggestion, therefore, was that that coastal borough should be absorbed into the city and managed by a common council.  The problems of that coastal borough are obviously different from the problems which confront the council with regard to the internal affairs of the city.  In the main, in regard to cities proper their problems are slumdum, housing, unemployment and industrial problems, which are questions that do not to any great extent affect the townships.  The problems which confront those townships would be problems towards development, and would be more in the direction of extending their capacity for attracting visitors and residential citizens in their direction.  Taking it for the moment that they were amalgamated with the City of Dublin, there is no question as to which of the problems mentioned are the graver problems.  I presume there is no question as to which area would have the majority of members on the council.  What would be the result?  It would be that the major problems, supported by the majority of interested members, would receive consideration to the exclusion of <Col N="1092" /> those problems affecting the borough area particularly.  Chiefly on those grounds I think the idea of establishing a separate coastal borough was a particularly sound one.  The only other choice, I take it, was to leave those areas as at the moment, a number of independent townships under different councils.  I did not hear any voice raised in support of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that from all directions there was a general expression of opinion in favour of unification, whether under a coastal borough or under the main city council.  The second objection to this Bill was based on the powers of the City Manager, or the alleged limited powers of the council.  That is a line of opposition that indicates a tendency on the part of certain people to think with their eyes. Really, in examining the reserved functions, the functions under A are mentioned in very few words&mdash;the power to strike a rate and to borrow money, and the immensity of powers conferred on the council by that subsection are almost limitless.  I could imagine this particular debate taking place if the powers under A were given, say, to the City Manager and all the powers at the moment reserved to the City Manager were given to the council.  Then I could hear this House resounding with cries about the power of the purse and that no other power mattered. From the Labour Benches and the Fianna Fáil Benches we would hear the power of the purse magnified beyond all recognition.  It would be hammered into us that the only real power in the household, in the city, and in the country was, in fact, the power of the purse.  Just by the transference of that one section alone we would have the powers indicated by that section magnified beyond recognition rather than minimised, as they are at the moment, out of all proportion to the actual fact.</P>
    <P>During Deputy O'Connell's speech it was apparent, and he admitted it, that when he tabled the motion for the rejection of this Bill he did not understand that the power in connection with housing plans or anything <Col N="1093" /> else rested with the council. I take it that he accepted correction on that point from the President, and I would submit that if when he tabled the motion he had been clearer on that particular point he would not have tabled it in its present form.  That is one point which, I think, should be clarified in discussing the further stages of this Bill. In the discussion of the powers of the Manager under the city council we had a kind of uneven, ill-balanced series of arguments.  In one breath we had the councils referred to as powerless, and in the next breath the same speaker would point out the undemocratic principle of allowing an undue voice in city affairs to be given to businessmen. If the council is absolutely powerless, why all this noise about how the various members are elected?  Why this talk about undemocratic reactionaries who give the management of our city over to businessmen according to their bank accounts? Are not the two arguments absolutely contradictory?  Does not the weight of evidence appear to indicate that the speakers appreciate the fact that the real power under this Bill rests with the council and not with the Manager?</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly asked where is provision made in the Bill for the council to advise the Manager.  If everything of that nature were incorporated in a Bill such as this the Bill would not stop at 10,000 pages.  Where is it indicated in the Bill that the councillors will enter the city hall by the door rather than by the chimney?  We must approach a Bill on the assumption that most people concerned with its work will be reasonable, human beings.</P>
    <P>We must approach it on the assumption that the Manager will be a reasonable man, that the council will be a reasonable council and that they will discuss their difficulties together. There was a certain reference to town planning; to the absence of powers to the council in the matter of town planning.  I submit that under this Bill we have the nucleus of the most useful town planning <Col N="1094" /> council that it has been possible to throw up.  If you take the Lord Mayor, the City Manager and a couple of members of the Dublin Council, together with the Mayor, the City Manager and the couple of members of the coastal borough: and the chairman of the county council, the secretary of the county council, and the couple of men from the county council, what better council could you have with regard to town planning?  Such a council would know the position from the centre, from the flank and from the extreme.  In that way you would have the machinery of perfect town planning.  These powers are contained in that Bill.  Anything better or more satisfactory than what is contained in this Bill I think it would be very hard to design.  Certain arguments have been advanced for the full incorporation of the whole area that was suggested by the Greater Dublin Commission.  That area extended from Malahide, Howth, Raheny and Baldoyle on the one side, to Leopardstown, Foxrock, Carrickmines, etc., on the other.</P>
    <P>In a Bill of this kind the one danger is that we might bite off a little more than we could chew.  If you were to take all that area quite suddenly and throw it into the City of Dublin in a Bill such as this what have you left?  What have you left of the County of Dublin?  You have a remnant of a county neither self-supporting in the financial sense nor self-supporting in the sense of population. You have disorganisation created by lopping off and chopping up I do not know how many district councils.  The only way in which a situation like that could be met is by passing portions of the remnants of the County of Dublin to the Counties Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.  The remnants of the county left would not be a self-supporting unit in any sense of the word, and that would be the only way to meet the difficulty. I presume that with the growth of the city in the course of time such a state of affairs may be reached, but such a situation should not be precipitated by placing legal difficulties, <Col N="1095" /> etc., in the way at the same time as we are working back to the re-establishment of a city council and extending within limits the area of that particular council.</P>
    <P>The third point of objection was, I think, raised by Deputy O'Kelly Deputy O'Kelly referred to the am putation of this coastal borough from the City of Dublin.  That was an example of a certain kind of muddled thinking.  I could not quite follow how you amputated a certain piece from another piece to which it had never been attached.  But he seemed to fancy himself in that particular role of sanguinary surgery, because he went further with his amputation and he asked us to visualise a certain degree of growth in this amputated portion of Ireland known as the Irish Free State.  I think it is fairly generally agreed that you do not amputate a man from a leg.  You amputate the leg from the man, and the smaller portion that is amputated from the big ger parent member is commonly regarded as the amputated portion. His remarks, therefore, were entirely irrelevant to the Bill and irrelevant to the Free State and to the particular area under discussion in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The next point of objection in connection with this Bill was the matter of the business vote&mdash;the business register giving a plurality of votes. Deputy T.J. O'Connell I think it was who went so far as to talk of human rights rather than of property rights.  We heard as you could anticipate in connection with a clause such as this a lot about democracy, etc.  The word democracy was used a great number of times. When we had this question of property rights rather than human rights raised by Deputy O'Connell we heard a great deal about democracy and human rights.  The Deputy in a democratic spirit was advocating one vote under the ordinary local government system of franchise.  But the local government system of franchise which the Deputy regards as democratic is in its very essence a property vote.  It is not a vote given to the individual <Col N="1096" /> because he has reached a certain age or because he exists at all.  It is given to an individual because he is paying certain rates on certain property. It is in its very essence a property vote.  The suggestion is that a commercial register should give votes for election to four seats on the council&mdash;that these votes should be given to certain ratepayers, paying a certain rate for the purpose of giving employment and that they should get votes up to the number of six.  I have heard a great deal about unemployment and the necessity for giving employment.  As far as I know this is the first time in this House that a gesture of this kind has been made towards the men who devote their capital to giving employment rather than towards men drawing dividends out of property situated outside this country.  This is not, as Deputy O'Kelly said, an attempt to give votes to people according to their bank accounts.  If there are two individuals each with £100,000 and one of them invests his £100,000 in shares that bring in dividends, while the other invests his £100,000 in the City of Dublin in order to give employment, and we will say to obtain the same dividends as the other, it is only the man who invests £100,000 in giving employment in Dublin who will get a multiplicity of votes under this section. With a thorough understanding and with a sympathetic approach towards the underlying reasons for such a suggestion as that, the matter will appear perfectly reasonable and proper. I believe that here in this House and certainly outside of here a great number of Deputies sitting on the benches opposite and on the benches on every side of the House would agree with the principle underlying that section.  Let us get down and face one thing and that is that one of the problems confronting us&mdash;and no matter who is the Government here it will confront them&mdash; is the problem of providing work for the unemployed.  Let us sink our little differences as to how exactly that is to be done, but let us agree and recognise that something has been done in that direction.  Let us <Col N="1097" /> for the sake of passing one single section of a Bill such as this allow this gesture of approval towards those who spend their money in giving employment in Dublin.  No party will suffer by that.</P>
    <P>This particular section has been held up in any light but the proper light, and I merely want to give my interpretation of what I consider and believe is the motive behind that particular section.  I started my remarks by saying that I believed this was essentially a Bill which should go to Committee, quite aside from how strongly we may resent certain sections in the Bill.  The facts as they appear so far indicate that opposition is to certain sections of the Bill and not to the Bill itself. The debate, as far as it has progressed, has done nothing but produce from all quarters of the House more and more argument as to why this Bill should go to Committee.  I pointed out that in Committee various things which numbers of Deputies are not clear on at the moment might be cleared up.  Believing, as I do, that this is a good Bill, I would nevertheless presume to make certain suggestions for consideration by the Minister in connection with amendments or alterations in the Bill as it stands.  I would make those recommendations believing the Bill to be a good Bill, and recognising the fact that I am unversed in municipal affairs, I would make those recommendations to a tribunal that I believe will consider them with sympathy, with knowledge, and if they are not approved of I will accept it that it is because the opinion of experts wishing well to the City of Dublin is that such alterations would be inadvisable.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I would make with regard to the powers of the City Manager relating to contracts. I believe that leaving contracts entirely to the decision of one individual is not in any way detrimental to the interests of the city, but that it places that individual in a position of extraordinary vulnerability to attack and criticism. <Col N="1098" /> I see the difficulty, because everything, no matter how small, can be interpreted as a contract, and it would be highly undesirable that approval of the council should be got in every little transaction.  But I think there is a point somewhere &mdash;£500 or £1,000&mdash;when transactions over a particular figure should get the approval of the council.  I further suggest that anything which can be contained in the Bill so as to prevent a deadlock between the council and the Manager&mdash;to prevent, as it were, a complete full stop &mdash;should, if considered desirable, be introduced.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>With that point in view I suggest for the Minister's consideration that if a certain number, say two-thirds of the council, disagree with the action of the Manager on any particular point then, rather than have a deadlock, in the event of such a thing happening the matter in dispute should go to the Minister for consideration and decision.  I further suggest to the Minister that the question of responsibility for the moulding of what is generally referred to as policy might be clarified either by addition or amendment in the later stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies talking in opposition to this Bill and referring to the limited powers of the council told the truth, but so far none of them told the whole truth.  They all read in its very narrowest spirit the reserved functions, but none of them called attention to the paragraph which immediately follows that dealing with reserved functions.  That paragraph lays it down that the council may by resolution call for any of the powers for the time being resting with the Manager, in which event their application will be considered by the Minister.  In discussing a Bill such as this, which essentially should be discussed as far as possible in a non-party and moderate spirit, I think it is only fair that everything that is in the Bill in connection with the point under discussion <Col N="1099" /> should be brought out at the same time.  Before sitting down I would like to congratulate the Minister on the amount of work and study that have been put into this measure. I consider this is a very fine attempt to give to the old City of Dublin what we are told it has been crying for for eighty years&mdash;to extend its borders and establish in its centre an efficient and up-to-date system of city management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not fail to be impressed by the appeal made by Deputy O'Higgins.  I would like to reinforce it.  I think in a Bill of this sort, which concerns itself with a City of which we all are equally proud, irrespective of whatever party we belong or have belonged to, a city whose interests are our interests and a city which, I am sure, we all would do everything in our power to advance, should be lifted out of the heat and the pettiness of political controversy.  I wish that we could go into a Committee of the Whole House at once with the Whips off so that with our gathered wisdom and unwisdom we might make this Bill perhaps nearer to our hearts' desire.  I hope I am not depreciating the Bill too much at the outset, because I do realise the immense difficulty and the complexity of the problem that the Minister has before him, the almost innumerable aspects from which this question had to be viewed, the countless interests, vested interests, rights and claims that had to be considered.  At one time I remember when I had to review it I found it an almost endless task to bring all the various aspects to a point, to concentrate on what one could picture a greater Dublin should be, in what direction it should advance, and how to legislate in order to promote that advancement; all that formed a very difficult task indeed.  The Minister had a very difficult task to face, and if he has not performed it perhaps wholly to my satisfaction, all I can say is that possibly it is impossible to satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> I think that there is at least one defect in the Bill, and there are other provisions in it that I would like to see supplemented, or improved in Committee.  I think the pivotal ideas in the Bill are four, the first two of which are the nondemocratic ideas, the City Manager, and the commercial register.  Of course, the City Manager is hopelessly undemocratic, but he has been adopted by the most democratic nations, and finally adopted across the Atlantic.  After all, that principle is in the country that has had the best municipal government for a hundred years&mdash;Germany&mdash;for, after all, the German Executive is singularly tyrannical and has got powers which no municipality in this island ever had or ever hoped to have. Another rather vexatious point is the commercial register.  I am not opposed to it in principle.  I have got rid of a good deal of my raw democratic ideas.  I know that this is an idea that tends to provoke the wrath of the pseudo-democratic doctrinaire who thinks that everything is comprised in the principle that one man is as good as another, and perhaps a little bit better.  I do think that the idea so clearly expressed by Deputy O'Higgins is an idea that is very prevalent, a democratic idea that a nation should recognise and reward those who do it a special and particular service.  I am strongly against a mere plutocratic franchise, and yet something like a plutocratic franchise obtained in Germany for over a hundred years; it was only swept away by the Revolution of 1918, and I do not know that municipal government was thereby improved very much.  But it is rather a small point, and a point that could be debated very well in Committee.</P>
    <P>Turning from these non-democratic ideas, another idea in the Bill is the incorporation of the townships of Rathmines and Pembroke.  I, of course, belonged to that class that viewed the old Dublin Corporation as a set of villains&mdash;I hope I am not saying anything very offensive to the President or to Deputy O'Kelly <Col N="1101" />&mdash;but when I studied the work of the Dublin Corporation a little more closely I realised that I was, to say the least, very bigoted, very ill-informed. But these townships certainly felt very reluctant to put themselves under the power of a body such as they conceived the old Dublin Corporation to be, and their reluctance was natural enough. They ran their own affairs very well, they were able to paddle their own canoe, and they claimed the right to continue to do so.  But certainly when one is asked to take a view of what a greater Dublin should be, one had to consider the whole thing de novo, and one could not find&mdash;I may be regarded as selling the pass by saying this&mdash;any reason why these townships should stand out.  I am told that in Rathmines it will mean an increase in my rates, but that is a small thing.</P>
    <P>But here I come to where I am at variance with the Minister, and I do not see how this can be improved in Committee&mdash;I would like to be informed by him as to whether he regards it as vital to the Bill&mdash;and that is, the creation of the coastal borough.  I do not know whether anybody has mentioned&mdash;I did not hear it mentioned&mdash;the history of this little movement to form a coastal borough.  It started by a Bill that somebody moved to introduce here in 1924, and you will remember that a petition to the Dáil and to the Seanad was presented by the lord mayor, aldermen and burgesses of Dublin, acting by the Commissioners of the County Borough of Dublin, under their common seal, against the Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and Dalkey Borough Bill that was projected. That matter was referred to the Greater Dublin Commission.  We went into the arguments very carefully there on both sides, and I think that the case for the borough was rather riddled.  When I found the Minister bringing up some of these arguments again I was rather surprised. I think he argued&mdash;I hope I am not travesting his words&mdash; that these townships are independent as regards drainage, water and roads, and that therefore as they <Col N="1102" /> did not cut across any lines of the main services of the city, they should be allowed to manage these things for themselves.  I think that some criticism about the drainage has been made already.  As regards the water, a statement was made in a petition that I think is worth referring to: &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Pembroke, Killiney, Ballybrack and Bray are entirely supplied with water by the corporation at a charge wholly under what it would cost the said urban districts to supply themselves and under what it now costs the corporation to provide that supply.&rdquo;  Those last words surprised me, but we went into it and found that they could be sustained.</P>
    <P>Dalkey, Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock are certainly independent of the city.  They have this claim&mdash;and this was admitted by the Greater Dublin Commission&mdash;that they have certain interests peculiar to themselves, seaside or coastal interests or amenities, which they could understand and look after better than any general council, and I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that if representatives of these townships were absorbed in a general council and if matters dealing with coastal amenities and development&mdash;baths, parks, and such like&mdash;were left to the discussion of the whole of the general council the interests of these coastal townships might be neglected or perhaps not treated so sympathetically as they ought to be.  But a suggestion was made that that could be got over by having particular sub-committees, that representatives of these townships, while taking part in the work of the general council should form sub-committees to deal with local problems which could be defined.  I cannot see any reason why this new coastal city. which will, I am convinced, stand across the line of the advance of Dublin, should be established.  Does the Minister not recognise that the establishment of this city will rob him of the invincible arguments that he can use for the inclusion of Pembroke and Rathmines?  Let him be <Col N="1103" /> logical.  Either allow all these townships to remain on their own still, or let him, as well as establishing this new city&mdash;I do not know what its name is to be: Dun Laoghaire perhaps&mdash;with a lord mayor and aldermen, establish a city of Rathmines, with a lord mayor and aldermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us have another mayor and aldermen for Pembroke. Perhaps Deputy Good would wear the chain.  I will be glad if the Minister can show me any reason why this new peculiarly privileged coastal city is to be formed.  There are plenty of reasons why Dublin should have some control over what was called Kingstown.  It was hoped at one time that the harbour there would be the great commercial harbour of Dublin.  Can we be certain that developments in that direction may not take place in the future? We must control the roads.  Otherwise who will look after them?  Are we to leave it to the consideration of the aldermen of the new coastal borough to say whether they will build a proper traffic road to Dublin or not?  There are plenty of other problems to be dealt with such as water and drainage.  I have only mentioned a few in which I can see it is vital that the city should have control of these townships, if it is vital that Dublin should control Rathmines and Pembroke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister has had a difficult task but I wish he had framed a Bill that would permit us to discuss these several points by themselves in Committee.  At present the Bill seems to be so framed that one is forced to vote when one is in favour of three-fourths of it against the Second Reading because one cannot conscientiously see one's way to accept the other fourth.  That is the way I feel, and I would like to know what the procedure will be, and how the Minister proposes to meet us in Committee.  I tried not to be contentious or capricious, and I hope whatever happens that we will have made this a Bill that will make our <Col N="1104" /> city what we want it to be, the leading city in Europe and the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave way to Deputy Alton on principle because this is a Bill to deal with Dublin, and I think that Dublin and Dublin people's opinion ought to be able to decide the nature of her government.  Anything that I say on the subject is not intended to be taken as in any way altering that position.  If machinery could be set up in the Dáil by which Dublin City and the people of Dublin could be consulted as to what they want, to decide the merits of the Bill apart from contributing our personal experiences in so far as they might be helpful, I do not think that the rest of the country ought to interfere any more than it possibly can.  But the difficulty is that, as far as I understand the principle of this Bill, it is practically that the Act which has been in operation in the City of Cork shall be applied to the City of Dublin.  That seems to me to be the whole principle, and when, therefore, we are asked to take such a lovely phrase as &ldquo;clarification,&rdquo; when we are to say that this Bill shall go to Committee and be modified, does that mean that it is to go to Committee still maintaining the principle of being, in general, the Act which was applied to Cork, and only be modified in detail?  We have had that word &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; before, where the Minister told us in relation to another measure that it was not clear, that it would have to be clarified, and that he did not know in which direction it was going to be clarified.  Are we to go to Committee for the clarification of this Bill without knowing in what direction?  If it is simply going to be a little modification in detail of the application of the principle that is represented by the Cork Act, then my advice to the citizens of Dublin is not to have anything to do with it.  It is their business to decide, but it is our business, so far as we have had actual experience of the Act upon which this Bill is founded to advise them not to have anything to do with it.  If &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; means that in Committee it will be <Col N="1105" /> radically altered to change entirely the centre of gravity of power in the council, then it seems to me that we will be voting against the principle of the Bill.  If this Bill is altered in Committee in conformity with what is apparently the will of this House on all sides, we will, in Committee, reject the principle adopted on the Second Reading of a Bill which we have passed in order to let it go to Committee. Personally I am in the curious position, possibly, that I see nothing undemocratic whatever in the most extreme form of devolution of authority.  A body of shareholders is entitled, if it chooses, without any defect from its democratic right, or without any lessening of its right to property in the thing which it had, to hand over the whole control and ownership to somebody else.</P>

      <P>No.  They could go further.  In exactly the same way a man in relation to his own individual life can exercise the whole liberty of that life in one single act to surrender himself in perpetual obedience to authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing undemocratic in the act.  There is no violation of personal liberty in a man rolling up all the possession and exercise of his liberty into one single moment and in that moment handing the control of every act of his life, of the properties of his life, and of the functions of his life freely into the authority of someone else.  Therefore, such a question as the question of whether you should set up a manager with complete authority, or with any degree of authority leading up to completeness, does not in my opinion, raise in any way the question of either liberty or democracy. But what does immediately raise the question both of liberty and democracy is that anybody else should surrender any portion of my liberty to somebody else without my consent. If machinery can be set up by which the will of the people of Dublin can be ascertained, and their will <Col N="1106" /> is to hand their liberty, the control of their property, and the exercise of their functions over to some man on their behalf, that is democracy as sound as you can get it.  But it is a very different thing indeed when a majority made up from Sligo, Kerry and Cork, from Donegal and Waterford, comes up here and hands over the liberties of the citizens of Dublin without ascertaining the will of the citizens into the possession of somebody else.  There is nothing democratic about that.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of the degree in which you do it.  You may carry devolution as far as ever you like within the ambit of your own authority, but as soon as you get outside of that authority you are simply handing over and dealing with other people's property.  That is the radical difficulty, that not the citizens of Dublin, but the central government of the country is handing over the powers of the citizens of Dublin to this authority.  If we want to be democratic and do this, then this central authority must provide all the funds the control of which it hands over to its representative. If this Dáil sets up machinery of any sort or kind to choose any particular man and then hands over all property to him, it should be the property of this Dáil, if it hands over to him the exercise of any liberty, it should be the liberty of this Dáil; and if it hands over to him the exercise of any authority, it should be the authority of this Dáil. This is nothing of the kind.  This is a Local Government Bill for Dublin so-called, and what it is in practice is an interference of the central authority in the country to decide what Dublin citizens shall do with their property and their liberty.</P>
    <P>It does not really matter from that point of view what amount of power you give or take from them.  This act is an invasion of their right. That being so, it seems to me that the duty of people like myself&mdash; people from Wexford, Wicklow and other counties&mdash;is, as far as is humanly possible under the circumstances, to stand in the place of the citizens of Dublin and do on their <Col N="1107" /> behalf what the citizens want.  I personally, from no communication of any sort or kind that I have had with any Deputy or any Party in this House, or from no communication I have had with any citizen of the City of Dublin, can say that they want this Bill.  I think that is the position as far as the ordinary member of this House is concerned.  That being so, quite apart from any question of Party or anything else, our responsibility is to see that, as far as possible, we do not allow the citizens of Dublin to have imposed upon them a Bill such as they do not want.</P>
    <P>As to the general question of whether you should govern by a City Manager or govern by what is called a democratically elected council, I personally have no special opinion.  All sorts of experiments of this kind have been tried.  They tried it out in New York, to the extent that eventually they decided to elect a mayor.  At the moment of the coming into office of the mayor, the existing town clerk, the city solicitor, the scavengers and everybody else went out of office.  They tried that experiment.  That is probably twenty-five years ago, so that the question we are discussing now is an old one.  It was summed up in this way: that they were going to make a Czar; if you got a good Czar you could not do better; but if you got a bad Czar, Heaven help the State.  Under the Bill of which this is an imitation&mdash;to some extent a pale imitation&mdash;you have set up a Czar in Cork.  Deputy O'Higgins told us that we should approach this Bill on an assumption.  You have not got to approach this Bill on any assumption.  You have got to approach this Bill on a knowledge of the facts, on the actual experience of other people who have lived under a similar one.  The toad beneath the harrow knows.  It is not a question of what you think the toad ought to feel; he has felt it.</P>
    <P>Why have the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives in Cork, the representatives of the Party which introduced and forced through <Col N="1108" /> the Dáil, by a majority of about four, the Cork Management Bill, turned against it?  They have not done it because they wanted to turn against it.  They certainly have not done it to provide an argument for those who opposed that Bill that they were right in opposing it and that the Government were wrong in introducing it.</P>
    <P>Why have the Independents turned against it.  They had nothing to gain one way or another; they had no prejudices and had expressed no opinions on the subject; no party loyalties of theirs were engaged in the matter.  Why did they want to walk out of the council.  Why have the members of the Business Party, individually, cursed and sworn at the Cork Act all over Cork.  They seem to have had the effrontery to defend a Bill in public which they had attacked in unmeasured language in private.  Men whose speeches you will find in the papers, saying that the Bill is a good Bill, have personally protested to me against the action of the Lord Mayor in not allowing the Bill to be broken up sooner.  They did not start out to do that, but they have lived under it. They did not approach the Bill under an assumption.  They came there full of ambition, many of them thinking: Now we are a City Council; we can do something; we can function and be important in our city.  They might just as well have been stuffed pillars for all they could do.  And that is the opinion expressed to me, time and again, by the very men who to-day can be quoted as saying in public: &ldquo;Well, on the whole perhaps, yes; it is a very nice Bill&rdquo;; that is just about the sort of speech you get from them now.</P>
    <P>Now why should we in Cork who have actual experience advise or allow, without protest, other members of this House, who do not represent the City of Dublin, to impose by the authority of this Dáil that sort of legislation upon Dublin?  The Lord Mayor of Cork, whose patience in this matter has been almost wonderful&mdash;certainly my patience would not have been anything like adequate <Col N="1109" /> to the strain&mdash;has told you some of the actual instances in which they came up against their own futility and helplessness.  I shall give another, to me perhaps the most fundamental one, but that may be my way of looking at it.  Under the Electricity Supply Act power was given to the Supply Board&mdash;amazing power&mdash;to cut off any area from the supply area of the City of Cork Electric Lighting and Tramway Company, and to light that area themselves. Now whether the Electricity Supply Board did that or did not do it might very materially affect the amount of money that would be paid for that undertaking, and the amount of money which, under the Act, would remain as a burden on the City of Cork.  Under the Act the E.S.B. decided to consider whether or not they would cut off the richest area from the point of view of possible useful supply, and a very critical area from the point of view of development, in so far as that if it was not cut off plant would have to be put in which would then have to be bought out.  They set up an inquiry under the Act to decide whether they would do so.</P>
    <P>Now if ever there was a question of policy for a city it was there. That inquiry was held.  The City Manager and city solicitor gave evidence at that inquiry, and evidence of such character as influenced the decision in that inquiry.  Neither before, during or after that inquiry was there any intimation of any sort, kind, or description given to the council that such a question had arisen, that such evidence had been given or what evidence had been given, or what the decision was, or anything about it.  Are we, who are not citizens of Dublin, having that experience, entitled either to advise the citizens of Dublin to take such a Bill, or to ask the Dáil to impose it upon them?</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the Bill, the only effective rights that the Dublin Corporation will have, as the only effective rights that we in Cork have, is to go on strike.  Now we have that right.  We do not draw <Col N="1110" /> up the estimates and we have no power to alter them.  We have power to accept or reject the estimates, and we can keep on rejecting estimates long enough to shut down the services of the city.  And that is the only effective powers that we have.  Deputy O'Higgins told us that the power of the purse was everything.  If your power over the purse is restricted to not spending money on something that you want to spend it on, what is the value of the amount of the control?  Nothing. I have power to starve my family by refusing to provide supplies.  But that is not any good.  We have not under this Bill power to decide the sort of supply, or the nature of the supply or the amount.  We have got simply one-sided control.  You have negative control of the purse; the manager has positive control.  I do not advise Dublin to accept that. Deputy O'Higgins made his whole speech in the first half sentence.  He said: &ldquo;I approach this Bill as a 100 per cent. supporter of the Government.&rdquo;  As to the question of reserved power of the manager, he said: &ldquo;Yes, things are really bad. The House is not liking this Bill. But if it is a question of for the Bill or against the Bill, the Bill will go. Let me put the case ad miseracordiam. Let me see if we cannot clarify it in Committee.&rdquo;  That was an ingenious speech of the kind that we used to get from Deputy Cooper. I always admired Deputy Cooper for the way he responded when called upon to get the Government out of a difficulty.  The Bill as it now stands, if left to an honest vote of the House, would be thrown out.</P>
    <P>An honest vote of Cumann na nGaedheal alone would throw out the Bill so we must not do that.  Let us go into Committee, and, he asked, &ldquo;may I be permitted, always on the understanding that if I am denied I know that I am denied because it is for the best, to make a few suggestions?&rdquo; His suggestion is that if the council disagree with the manager by a two-third majority then the decision goes back to the Minister for Local Government. Well, it is still in Dublin anyway. <Col N="1111" /> When we were discussing this in Committee the last time we tried every possible variant of method of attempting to get alternative control. Every one of them was thrown out.  The Cork Bill was the perfect method.  What would have happened assuming that provision had been in operation in the Cork Bill in the last year?  This Bill is the same as the Cork Bill.  We would have been coming during the year to a Minister who, after a year, drafts exactly the same Bill.  That is the man to whom we are to go and ask really you ought not to give us more powers when after a year's meditation he throws at the City of Dublin the same thing he threw at us.  That I think probably was what Deputy O'Higgins referred to when he spoke of certain kinds of muddled thinking.  At the present moment the meetings of the council are just a nuisance to the manager.  They just impede him in the function he now performs as the sole controller of the city.  As far as I know, there are only four meetings which there is any necessity under the Bill to have.  We have in Cork a vain attempt made to put some life and reality into this thing.  We had arranged to have some other meetings; but as Deputy French said it is purely a matter of courtesy whether the manager comes to them or not, and it is purely a matter of courtesy whether he comes to the four statutory meetings or not.  As far as I can see there is no particular reason why he should supply, even to the four statutory meetings, any information of any importance. Yet this is the skeleton around which flesh and blood have to be put to make a great and greater city out of the Dublin of the Pale.</P>
    <P>They have introduced another very interesting clause into this, and again it is one I personally am not going to say I wholly and completely disagree with.  That is a clause in which some representation is given on a varying basis founded on the particular nature of your holding in the city.  I would be inclined myself, <Col N="1112" /> if it were a question of that kind, if a man could show that he had one hundred employees, to consider him very much.  If he was engaged in a business of manufacture as distinct from a business of distribution, I could see quite a case for that if the case that is put forward is that those people cannot be represented under the ordinary franchise.  But what has been our experience in Cork?  There was a council of twenty-one elected.  Fianna Fáil got two members.  I much rather that they had not gone forward at all.  I did not want them to go forward. Cumann na nGaedheal got either two or three.  Those were the two big organised parties, and that is all they got out of the twenty-one.  Labour got two.  The three organised parties together, with all their resources, did not get one-third of the representation. Now, it does not look, on that basis, as if an individual with an individual outlook, and individual interests, were likely to fail to get elected.  These very people for whom you are now manufacturing a special franchise got six votes.  They got as much as the organised parties put together.  Now, under this Bill you are going to give them another four. That makes ten.  Is there any case shown in regard to the success which what are called business candidates met with in the City of Cork for the necessity of making special provision for business candidates?  Personally I think not.  If, for instance, we had been using the Bill in Cork for some years, and due to the fact that there was better organisation in political parties than there was in economic parties, who, it had been shown, could not get representation on that basis for what are called the business community, I personally would have been in favour of providing machinery by which they would, just as if I found that the operation of any other law of election of that kind meant that there were permanently excluded from representation a section which ought to be represented, obtain representation. That has been found in this <Col N="1113" /> Dáil, and in other elections by proportional representation, but certainly on our experience there and on the comparative successes, the amazing successes, if you like to put it, of the business party in that election, you cannot found a case that they must be spoon-fed with special votes in order to be elected.</P>
    <P>Now some people suggest that all this Bill wants is that in some little detail here and there the things that are obscured shall be made clear.  Well now, on the face of our experience, does it look as if it were a question merely of clearing up details?  It looks to be a case of radical alteration or nothing.  The structure is so ruinous and of a design so bad that it calls for complete reconstruction with different material, and of a different design in another place.  That would be my definition of the clarification that is required in this Bill.  Dublin, in six or eight months of the use of this Bill, would be sick of it, sick not merely of the party who gave it, but sick of this Dáil as a whole, that had the effrontery to take into its hands the power, the rights, the liberty and responsibility of the citizens of Dublin and put them into this form.  I am perfectly sure of it. I have nothing to alter as far as I am personally concerned.  In anything I have said in relation to the Cork Bill from the very beginning, I have always been absolutely in favour of the clearest and most distinct dissociation between the regulation of policy and the control of executive acts.  Take out of the power of what are called democratically-elected representatives patronage and you can give them any other power of any kind you like, because the wrong ones will not go there, as there will be nothing for them to go there for.  Set up, if you like, a Czar if the City of Dublin wants him, and let him govern, and I certainly will not interfere and say that the City of Dublin is undemocratic in setting up a Czar to govern.  Set up a council, if you like, which has authority and which has continuous control.  That is the issue, continuous control of policy, power to <Col N="1114" /> continue it or to change it, but do not put up a camouflage of a council. The only effective thing that the City of Cork Council were able to do was to give the Freedom of the City to an actor-manager who played mixed hockey with the population.  Nothing else.  I challenge anybody to show any other single executive act which in all that time they have been able to do.  You can, if you like, give the Freedom of the City to an actor who plays mixed hockey with the population. You have that power, but it does not seem to be enough power to go through all the machinery of having to elect a council for it. Either give your council an amount of responsibility of that kind, a power which will bring to the services of that council responsible men who will have pride in the work they are able to do, or frankly and honestly go on administering, as an act of authority of this Dáil, through its Minister for Local Government, the whole business.  Do not fool with it.  Do one thing or the other.  Let us either have a Czar or a council with some authority, but do not let us make a fool of ourselves. And we are making a fool of ourselves.  Do not let us make a fool of the capital city of this State by offering it what everybody knows will be simply a mockery of self-government.</P>

      <P>In all the long discussion that has gone on about this Bill, I failed to notice that any attention was paid to the fact that in this Bill the Minister for Local Government has at least the credit of having adopted a new and more satisfactory method of procedure for dealing with the government of Dublin City.  In the old days, if it was thought desirable to extend the boundaries of Dublin City, such an action could only be carried out by introducing a Private Bill into the Legislature, and the expenses in connection with a Private Bill of that kind would run to many thousands of pounds.  There is no doubt whatever that sooner or later, apart from other aspects of the present Bill, it will be found necessary to include <Col N="1115" /> within the boundaries of Dublin City the districts of Rathmines and Pembroke.  An effort to do that was made many years ago.  The effort, as the Minister for Local Government pointed out, was a failure, but it cost £50,000 to bring about that failure.  There is a tendency on the part of public representatives in these areas at the present time to object to the unification of Rathmines and Pembroke with Dublin, which it is contemplated to bring about in this Bill.  I think it is pertinent to point out that the alternative to this Bill for these areas is the production of another Private Bill, which, whether or not it gets through the Dáil and the Seanad, will, at any rate, cost a considerable amount of money and which ultimately will probably prove much less favourable to the people of these districts than the present Bill is.</P>
      <P>I think, in taking on this responsibility of rearranging the government of Dublin City, whatever opinions may be held about the characteristics of the Bill which he has produced, everyone must admit that the Minister for Local Government has performed a great service to the people of Dublin.  I think that credit should be given to him and to the Government for taking on what is, after all, and what has proved to be in many ways, a rather thankless responsibility.  You have had opposition to this Bill from all sides.  No two elements agree in the precise direction that their opposition took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the Fianna Fáil Party objecting to this Bill because, while in larger national affairs they are anything but democratic, in municipal affairs and the government of cities they profess to be the most ultra democratic party in the country.  We have the Labour Party objecting to this Bill because they always insist on going a little beyond democracy, and becoming doctrinaire, and because they object to certain provisions in the Bill for giving special representation to special classes.  We have the representatives <Col N="1116" /> of Rathmines and Pembroke passing resolutions because they are afraid that the rates in Rathmines and Pembroke will be raised.  We have the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; thundering denunciation against this Bill because they object to compulsory Irish.  We have all kinds of denunciations from all sides, and if you go through the wearisome task of reading or listening to these denunciations and comparing them, you will find that hardly any two of the numerous parties that come forward to denounce this Bill agree on any one particular point on which they denounce it. Deputy Lemass was very robust yesterday evening in his denunciations of this Bill.  He denounced the Government for interfering with the creation of a great City of Dublin stretching across Dublin Bay.  One would imagine that Deputy Lemass had only flown suddenly into the Dáil yesterday evening from a cloud cuckoo land where there already existed this glorious city on Dublin Bay which contained every village and every dwelling house within twenty miles of the mouth of the Liffey and encumbered by no interference from the pressure of Cumann na nGaedheal or the various elements which are always ready to support Cumann na nGaedheal.  The fact about this Bill is that it is not a Bill for the dismemberment or partition of Dublin City, but a Bill which takes a considerable step towards its final unification.  One aspect of the Bill which the Dáil has to consider is whether such unification has proceeded far enough under it. That would be a fair way of looking at the Bill, but it is not fair to say that Dublin has been dismembered and disunited.  There existed in Dublin up to the present many conflicting jurisdictions, many overlapping staffs, and there have existed many cases in which the work could be done more efficiently by one authority.  The time has now come to bring about unification.  It would be fair to say that we believe that unification could go further than it is proposed to bring it in this <Col N="1117" /> Bill.  That would be fair criticism, but it is not fair criticism, and it would hardly be honest criticism of the Bill to throw in phrases about partition, and to try and clog its progress with all sorts of irrelevant allusions to political matters which have nothing to do with the Bill. The Bill is one for the unification of Dublin.  That is made a big difficulty in the case of Dublin because of certain recent circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly admitted yesterday evening that, whatever else might or might not be said about the old Corporation of Dublin, it was not characterised by the most thorough efficiency.  In actual fact, everyone knows that for many years before the old Corporation disappeared the citizens were growing more and more tired of its inefficiency, and it was becoming more and more widely recognised that the Corporation was no longer a type of body capable of carrying out the complicated business of a large modern capital.  The Corporation was done away with, and in place of it an experiment was tried which brought the government of the city to the opposite extreme.  The democratic element was done away with and a body of autocrats was set up.  That experiment was tried for a number of years, but it was admitted from the beginning that it was only a temporary experiment, and no one expected that it would be permanent.  Now the time has come, having before us the experience of these two attempts&mdash;the attempt at democracy and the attempt at autocracy&mdash;to get some system of government for the city which will combine the advantages of those two systems for the good of the citizens of Dublin.  It seems to me that while, of course, this is a type of Bill upon which it is easy for people to have different opinions&mdash;it contains a large number of provisions, and embraces a large number of questions&mdash; taking the Bill as a whole, it gives evidence not only of hard work on the part of the Minister and his Department but also shows that a highly ereditable attempt is made to combine these two elements, and to produce from the combination of <Col N="1118" /> them something that will redound to the good of the citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not admit, in the first place, the right of the Fianna Fáil Party, or any member of it, to spring on the democratic horse in this Assembly and to ride away on it.  The democratic horse is a very dangerous horse for the Fianna Fáil Party to ride in this Assembly.  Apart from that, however, and leaving out the qualification of the witnesses, I think that very few citizens would go so far as to agree with the extremely democratic, or so-called democratic, doctrines to which Deputy Flinn has treated the House.  I think that few citizens will admit the unlimited and uncontrolled right of Dublin, or any other city, to decide its own destiny for itself without interference or control from the people or any other authority in this State. It is a principle which, if carried to the fullest extent, would lead to complete anarchy, as extreme democracy is often liable to do if carried too far.  It is proposed by this Bill to set up, in addition to the enlarged City of Dublin, a borough to be known as the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  The reasons for that step are somewhat subtle.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill the rights or wrongs of which cannot be decided by sledge-hammer methods.  You cannot settle the government of a city merely by shouting democracy or painting pictures of a rose-red city stretching across the Liffey from sea to sea.  All these matters require careful consideration and involve a good deal of subtlety in their consideration and decision.  The reasons for setting up the Borough of Dun Laoghaire are, as I say, reasons which cannot be made obvious by sledge-hammer methods alone.  The position, in fact, is that Dublin up to the present consisted of a municipality with two large outlying urban districts which should belong to the municipality, as is admitted by everybody, and a string of smaller urban districts stretching along the sea-coast with <Col N="1119" /> no connection between the various administrations, and in spite of what Deputy Lemass has said, having problems of their own, problems peculiar to themselves which could only be settled by themselves.  Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock have been struggling along for a number of years with separate Councils, separate staffs, but all the time with problems which are very similar and which could be settled more efficiently by a single organisation.  At the same time there are problems in Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire, such as the housing problem, the drainage problem, and various other problems of that kind, which are peculiar to Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire and which could best be settled by those two districts acting in harmony with each other if that harmony could be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who criticise this Bill always fail to notice the good effects which it involves.  When criticising the setting up of the Dublin coastal borough they talk about partition but they forget that in the case of that borough there is an effort at the unification of that large area which, so far, has been scattered and disunited and which it is proposed to bring together under one government. It is not uncommon or anomalous that there should exist a large city side by side with a smaller area governed by a different municipality. You meet that over and over again in cities all over the world.  These two areas have, as I say, problems which differentiate them in many cases sharply from one another and when the growth of neither of them is likely to be impeded by the existence of the other there is a good case for taking the course which the Minister has taken in this Bill.  Reference has been made to the future of districts like Stillorgan, Foxrock and Cabinteely, and attempts have been made to show that under the Bill their fate is completely left in the air, undecided. It only needs a cursory reading of the Bill to show that ample provision is made, as soon as the necessity for the incorporation <Col N="1120" /> of these two areas into Dublin can be proved after careful and full examination, for their incorporation into the city.  I know that the city is extending in the direction of Stillorgan.  The Mount Merrion Estate was mentioned here last night.  That is a very recent project and it is in its very early stages.  One attempt to carry out that project has been a failure and it is still very much of a question whether the urbanisation of that area has proceeded, or is likely to proceed, far enough to make it necessary to incorporate it into Dublin.  If, and when, that necessity arises ample provision is made in the Bill to secure that that area shall be incorporated easily and rapidly, without the machinery of Private Bills or expensive private legislation that was always involved in matters of that kind.  That is another aspect of the Bill.  It sets out to do away with the cumbrous machinery for extending the boundaries of the City of Dublin and its sets up machinery by which these boundaries can be readily and easily extended after a careful consideration of the various problems that arise from the extension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in the usual Fianna Fáil fashion, talked about setting up the Borough of Dun Laoghaire as something that was being done under the influence of some secret cabal.  He tried to make it appear that the urban districts of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock, which returned Deputy Brady amongst others to the Dáil, are districts which are monopolised by certain reactionary elements, and that the Government in setting up a new borough in that area was dictated to by these reactionary elements.  I do not know what the ratepayers of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire will think of the opinion that has been expressed of them by the chief spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House in trying to set up some secret bogey in this respect, but I think Deputy Lemass is making a very unfortunate attempt, and one to which very little attention will be paid.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of criticism, <Col N="1121" /> particularly from Cork, with regard to the institution of a City Manager in Dublin, and that criticism has taken most peculiarly vague lines.  It is assumed by the speakers that the ideal system, and the system that should be set up under this Bill, is a system of complete democracy, a system in which full powers would be given to the council, and the manager would be placed in the position of being a servant of the council. That is to say, the manager would be in the position in which the Town Clerk used to be under the old Corporation.  That is the form this criticism has taken.  The whole genesis of the Bill has lain in the fact that that system of municipal government has been tried for many years in the country, and has been proved to be a complete failure.  The case for the institution of a City Manager is written large across the streets of Dublin.  The case has been tried and proved over and over again, and all this talk about reactionary methods, about the desertion of democracy, and so on, is in itself reactionary.  It is an attempt to throw back the government of Dublin to the bad old period when Dublin was not governed at all, when there was nothing but a series of vague committees which interfered with one another's work, and the general result of whose operations was that nothing was done.</P>
    <P>This whole principle that the legislative and the executive functions of the municipality should be divided is a principle that should need no justification in the Dáil.  It is a principle that has been proved to be a proper principle over and over again.  If we are to take that principle and if we are to divide the legislative and the executive functions of the city, how are we to set about it?  I suggest that the method adopted in the Bill is about as good a method as any that could be devised to accomplish that object.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, the control of the purse, the control of all expenditure, whether by way of rates or by way of loan, is vested absolutely in the council, and a council which, having that control <Col N="1122" /> in its hands, having that power of checking and overhauling expenditure, of supervising the budget of the Manager, even before he attempts any expenditure, does not use and exercise that control over the Manager is going to be a very poor council indeed.  I suggest that if that happens the failure in that case will rest, not on the shoulders of the Manager, but on the shoulders of the council.</P>
    <P>I am not going to follow Deputy J.J. Byrne into the extremely philosophical and metaphysical distinction he tried to make between administrative and executive functions. I fail to see that there is any great distinction between one and the other, and the principle which was adopted in this Bill seems to be the proper principle of distribution, that the council has the power of the purse and the Manager has the power of action under the supervision of the council, which supervision is and can be exercised, by reason of the control of the purse vested in the council.  My difficulty about all these problems&mdash;it is in many ways a personal difficulty, and I do not know that I will get very many people to see eye to eye with me&mdash;is that I am much more afraid that the council will not be a success than I am afraid the Manager will not be a success.  I am much more afraid that the council set up by the measure will be a council that will concern itself first and foremost with an attempt to get control of patronage, and, secondly, will concern itself with political matters largely outside its sphere.  It should be our aim, as far as we can achieve it in this Bill, to secure that such a council will be set up as will refrain from interfering in these matters, in matters such as the employment of labour or the giving of patronage, such a council as will confine itself to the business side of administration and to the general supervision of the finances of the city and the planning, in conjunction with the Manager, from the financial point of view, of the lines on which the municipality should progress in the future.  There is plenty of scope in the Bill as it <Col N="1123" /> stands for a council that wishes to do that, and any council that attempts to do more will only wreek this Bill and will run the risk of retarding the progress in the municipal government of Dublin for many a long year.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I must confess gives me a certain amount of concern, and in regard to which I am likely to get fewer people to agree than on the other matter, is the question of the institution of the Lord Mayor.  I am inclined to think that this whole business would be much better settled by having one person to act as titular and actual head of the municipality.  But conditions being what they are, I think that that person should not be elected by popular suffrage.  That person should be appointed on merit.  I would like to see, not only in Dublin but all over the country, a system of local government by which officers, chosen for proven merit, would be appointed to govern the various districts in the country, and would be given authority by the State to act as sole governors.  I say that because I believe, from the experience we have had not only in Dublin but all over the country, that we have proved, and proved very successfully, that our system of popularly elected local councils is an unfit system for efficient and progressive administration in local government in this country. I know that in saying that I will not get very many to agree with me.</P>

      <P>I must say that, in my opinion, this Bill would be a better Bill if, instead of having a Manager with a Lord Mayor beside him&mdash;a Lord Mayor paid probably a large salary for presiding over the meetings of the council and receiving distinguished strangers, because quite possibly that is all he will take on himself to do&mdash;you were to give the Manager not only the power but the glory as well.  Let the Manager be the representative of the city.  If <Col N="1124" /> he has to do the work of governing the city he should also have, I think, the credit of being its governor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>You never could tell.  You might be in the Viceregal Lodge yourself yet.  I am afraid that what is likely to happen under this Bill is this: you will set up a Manager who will be concerned with the administration of the city, with the executive work of governing the city.  Side by side with him you are going to set up an elected head of an elected body, who will be paid a large salary and will have a great deal of prestige&mdash;all the prestige that he can be given.  That person will be likely, to some extent, to use his position to interfere with the work which the Manager is doing.  In consequence of that, you will have the danger of constant friction between the titular head of the municipality and its actual executive working head.  Personally, I would prefer to see a system by which you would have one governor&mdash;that he would do the work and get the credit for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposition that has been expressed against the proposal for a special commercial franchise has already, I think, been sufficiently answered.  One would imagine that the council which it is proposed to set up was going to have all the work of governing the city on its own hands.  It is not.  Surely it is going to be an advisory council, a council whose function will be primarily that of financial control-one to advise the Manager.  In addition to that there is the fact that our present franchise in the city is a property franchise: that at the present moment no person is given a <Col N="1125" /> vote in a municipal election purely because of his human existence, as Deputy O'Connell said.  These two facts are, I think, a sufficient reason to justify the institution of some special franchise by means of which a very small number of people, who have special business and financial qualifications, will be sure of getting elected to the municipality.  I think that, so far from such a proposal being reactionary, it is a progressive proposal.  It is a proposal which, if carried out in the proper spirit, will result in the setting up of a more competent, a more experienced and generally a more efficient municipal body to advise the executive governor of the city.  I fail to see that the ultra-democratic arguments we have heard have any force in this matter at all.  The danger about these democratic arguments is that behind democracy there always lurks somewhere or other the doctrinaire, if you go far enough to look for him.  I am afraid that in their zeal for red tape democracy the Labour Party are proving themselves to be more doctrinaire than democratic.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the beginning of a big experiment in municipal government in Dublin.  It is an experiment which, as I said, takes the place of two previous experiments, neither of which was completely satisfactory. There was one thing at least in Deputy O'Kelly's speech with which I agree.  I am not saying anything, because I do not know very much, about the recent government of this municipality, but I agree that, a priori, autocratic government in a municipality is apt to neglect, to some extent, the interests of the poorer classes in the community and to concentrate more on the interests of the wealthy.  For that reason, I believe that a great deal depends, from the point of view of the ordinary citizens of Dublin, on the successful working of the machine that is going to be set up under this Bill. I believe that it is going to be a very difficult thing to get twenty-five men, business men, professional men or working men, who more and more <Col N="1126" /> as the world progresses, are finding themselves engrossed in the work of their own daily lives, to take up this business of governing the City of Dublin, a business in which their only reward will be a sense of having done good to their fellow citizens&mdash;a business in which they have no particular reason to be more interested than anybody else.  It will be very difficult, I say, to get twenty-five men who will do that work competently, men who will confine themselves to the very important business which is allotted to them under this Bill, men who will not try to destroy the machinery of this Bill by unduly or too hastily wishing to extend that work.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the whole success of this Bill depends upon a loyal acceptance of co-operation by the municipal council with the Manager.  If you get a council under this Bill which, for pseudo-democratic, political or any other reason, sets itself up from the beginning in opposition to the Manager, in criticising the work of the Manager in an undue way, in interfering with his work where under the Bill he is the sole authority&mdash;if you get a body like that, then the government of Dublin is going to be worse in the end than it was in the beginning, and you are going to have to do all this work over again in a couple of years.  That will happen under this or any other Bill which sets up two parties like these to govern.  As soon as you set up a single governor, and side by side with him an advisory council, under conditions as they are and with public opinion as it seems to be, there is always the danger that the whole machinery of that institution may be damaged by friction between these two bodies.</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of members of the Dáil, instead of indulging in cheap semi-political criticism of the measure which after all is a measure designed for the good of the citizens of Dublin, and introduced by the Minister when he might very well have left it to the citizens of Dublin to settle their own difficulties by means of private and costly legislation, <Col N="1127" /> in considering this measure to avoid, as far as possible, any controversy or any direction of discussion which would be likely to give rise in the future to that kind of friction between the Manager and the council. I wish that members of the Dáil could address themselves, in a spirit of impartial interest, to the welfare of Dublin and to the future progress of Dublin as a great capital city&mdash; that they could address themselves in that spirit to the framing of this Bill and accept the result of the long and difficult labours on the part of the Minister for Local Government in the loyal and dutiful spirit in which that result has been put before the House in this Bill.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a number of speeches on the subject of this Bill during the last couple of days.  It appears to me there are a couple of points that have not been touched on in any of these speeches. The Deputy who spoke a few moments ago possibly touched on one of these points when he asked what is the view of Dublin.  In all the <Col N="1128" /> speeches we have listened to from members of the Executive Council and others, we have not heard, at least I have not, any expression as to the view of Dublin, and Dublin surely ought to be considered when bringing in a Bill that is going to make such drastic changes in its administration as this Bill proposes. One would imagine that one of the very first things any Deputy, particularly any Deputy on the Government Benches, would endeavour to get information about is the view of the various areas that will be affected by the Bill.  Has any Deputy who has spoken dealt with that question? Since the publication of this Bill I have endeavoured, as far as one could, to get the views of Dublin men on it.  Nowhere in the city amongst the people I have come in contact with have I found the least enthusiasm for this Bill.  The view of Dublin men is that Dublin wants to be left alone.  Dublin is tired of changes.  We have had nothing but changes in all departments of administration for the last ten years, and we are getting heartily sick of changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us on these benches listened last night to a very representative deputation from Rathmines. What I told the House about Dublin is true of Rathmines.  It wants to be left alone.  On Monday night I listened to the views of a great many of my co-representatives in Pembroke. They were unanimous in the view that they wanted to be left alone.  Will the Minister who put forward this Bill tell me who wants it?  I have been closely in touch with the city for some years past and I do not know of any expression of opinion from any section calling for this Bill.  If nobody wants it why is it brought forward?  We have in the city at the moment an administration with which we are quite satisfied.  We have in Pembroke a council with which we are quite satisfied, and the same applies to Rathmines.  As far as I know, in the coastal boroughs there is no enthusiasm for the Bill.  Where, then, is the demand for it?  What is the <Col N="1129" /> reason for bringing it in?  Surely that is one of the first things we ought have had information about from the Minister.  There is no use in telling me that the matter was brought forward by the old Dublin Corporation, and that the demand comes from the old Dublin Corporation. That Corporation has been buried, and I do not want to hold any post mortem on it.  Deputy O'Kelly did his best last night to whitewash it.  Why, all the water in the Liffey could not whitewash the old Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I will leave that to the Deputy.  He knows these mixtures better than I do.  The question that arises from the point of view of a businessman, is, what advantage is Dublin going to get out of this Bill? Not a single Deputy who has discussed this Bill during the last two days has dealt with the economic aspect of it.  Surely that is one of the first questions we ought to consider&mdash;what advantage is this Bill from the economic point of view, going to be to the city?  What advantage is it going to be to Pembroke, Rathmines and the other areas affected?  Has a single Deputy devoted a speech or any of his thoughts to the subject?  This policy of change during the last ten years has not been carried out without incurring considerable burdens which the ratepayers and taxpayers are trying to bear.  In the Estimates we find under the item of superannuation and retiring allowances we are carrying a burden in the current year of £1,777,400. That is as a result of this policy of change.  Add that to the other burdens we are carrying for pensions, £2,727,000 for old age pensions, £253,473 for Army pensions, and £66,903 for teachers' pensions, and we find we are carrying a total burden of £4,824,776.  That burden represents <Col N="1130" /> something between twenty per cent. and twenty-five per cent. of our total taxation going in pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to abolish the Dublin Corporation, the Pembroke, Blackrock, Kingstown, Urban Districts of Rathmines, Killiney and Dalkey, and also the Rathmines and Pembroke Joint Hospital Board, the Rathmines and Pembroke Main Drainage Board, and a number of other authorities.  What addition is that going to mean to our pensions list?  Has any Deputy made a conjecture as to the number of officials that will be pensioned as a result of this change, and that will become a charge on the local authorities and inflate the burden we are paying for out of the other pocket as taxpayers? These are economic aspects of the Bill which I would like to see getting some attention from this House, but not a single Deputy has attempted to touch on them.  I wonder would the Minister in his reply be able to tell us what the resulting burden on the ratepayers of this Bill is going to be?  I am sure what he will tell us is that it would be impossible for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some experience here lately of trying to force the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to give us an estimate.  That was when we had the Poor Relief Bill in connection with Dublin before us.  He refused to give any estimate, and I am sure the reply he will give in this instance will be similar to the one he gave then&mdash; that is, it would be impossible to say what the burden on the local authorities will be as a result of the pensioning of those officials.  That is why I ask that before we pass measures of this kind we should have some facts as to the burdens, and not have Deputies talking, like the last speaker, about ideals of local government.  We are carrying <Col N="1131" /> burdens as the result of other changes that are pressing very heavily to-day on trade and commerce. We have burdens with regard to pensions that are quite heavy enough without adding to them.  Before I, at any rate, vote for any such Bill as this I am going to know what burden it will entail. I would like any Deputies who may speak on this Bill, particularly Deputies on the Government Benches, to give us some information on these two points.  I do not want to deal with a number of points dealt with by other Deputies, but those are two matters of primary importance that we ought to know about and have all the details in connection with before we proceed any further.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up time dealing with a number of other subjects that have already been dealt with very fully in connection with this Bill.  There are, however, one or two items on which I would like to express an opinion.  First of all, the Bill deals with the question of the coastal borough.  If I could get any reason at all for the bringing in of this Bill I might be satisfied.  The one reason that I got that seemed to have any substance in it was that all these local authorities would be brought under one rule.  What is the first step the Bill takes?  We were told that the reason for the Bill was to bring all local authorities under one authority.  Now, when we get the Bill we find that instead of bringing those bodies under one authority it sets up two, if not more, authorities.  It sets up a coastal borough with a mayor, four aldermen and fifteen councillors.  And the mayor, aldermen and councillors are to deal with an area and with a population that is about the same size as Pembroke at the moment. The population of Pembroke and the population of the new coastal borough are as near to one another as it is possible to get.</P>
    <P>We have the position that instead of doing away with small local authorities we are setting up for all <Col N="1132" /> time under this Bill the idea of small authorities against big authorities. What will be the effect of that with regard to this particular coastal area?  We have heard ideals expressed with regard to this coastal area and what might be done with it. One penny in the £ in Pembroke produces £600.  If you want to do anything in the way of a marine promenade in the coastal borough to attract visitors and to give some amusement to your own citizens £100,000 or £150,000 is not going to go very far with the project.  Now, saddling a coastal borough of that sort with its income, and with the expenditure it would have normally, will kill it for all time.  It will take the rest of your and my time to try to pay off that debt.  That is the position.  The Minister said to-day that that would be an expenditure for the local area and would not affect Dublin.  He objects to Dublin coming to the assistance of the local area.  Deputies will remember his interjection here to-day, and that was his answer to that point&mdash;that projects of that kind for the purpose of attracting visitors are going to be a whole charge on the local area.  It will be a charge on the local area and Dublin and the whole country will benefit.  The idea is absurd.  If we want a coastal borough of that kind, or if we want that area to be put in the condition in which we would like to see it, these improvements cannot all be charged to the local area.  It is only from its connection with a big city like Dublin that these functions can be carried out and that the resources of these areas can be made the success that we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>There were two other points touched on, and to these I would like to refer briefly.  One was the special representation given to the business men.  I do not know whether any of the Deputies understand our system at the moment.  I listened very carefully to what has been said on the Bill.  Are Deputies aware that there is no provision made in this Bill for giving votes to limited liability companies?  The <Col N="1133" /> Minister informed us that over 50 per cent. of the valuation of the city was made up of business premises. The larger number of these would be owned by limited liability companies. In other words, a moiety of your rates in the city is contributed by limited liability companies that get no vote whatever in return.  I am as strong an admirer of democracy as any man.  Is that fair or reasonable?  Labour Deputies have taunted us that other countries have dealt with that problem, and that they have given representation to those people who were denied representation. A moiety of your taxation is contributed by limited liability companies that have no representation whatsoever given in return. I do not think that matter needs any further argument from me.</P>
    <P>The other question on which I wish to touch is the question of the manager.  I was glad to hear the Lord Mayor of Cork saying that he heartily approved of the principle of having a manager.  That conforms exactly to my experience. Many Deputies who have experience on local authorities know the difficulty where no manager existed of getting the policy that they laid down carried out through the various departments.  The council meets once a month.  Do you think that you can get a policy carried out and co-ordinated through your various departments by a council meeting once a month?  The thing is absurd. It is only through a manager it can be done and done efficiently.  We may differ as to the powers and authority that ought to be given to that manager, but the question of appointing a manager, as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I speak after 25 years' experience of local government&mdash;is one with which I am heartily in accord.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the subject of this Bill.  I just want to add that I wish to urge on the Government that this Bill might be withdrawn.  As I have already said, nobody wants it.  We will have much more experience, and we will <Col N="1134" /> be in a much better position, possibly some years hence, to deal with a problem of this kind than we are to-day.  In urging that particular action I ask what injury can the withdrawal of the Bill do?  From the information I have I am satisfied that if a plebiscite were taken of every area that is affected by this Bill we would get back a return showing a 90 per cent. majority in favour of letting us alone.  If that is the position, and I submit it is, why force the Bill on us?  There is no demand for it as far as I can see. Even in this House there is no unanimity with regard to it.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General McKeon General McKeon">
      <NameTxt>General McKeon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House by offering any lengthy views upon this Bill.  I will just content myself with making a few general remarks.  Every argument I heard used against this Bill to-night could be used, and actually is used, with equal force against the development of the City of Boston. Some years ago the State of New York adopted a Bill for the City of New York something like what is now proposed for Dublin.  The result is that to-day New York is one of the greatest cities in the world. The City of Boston, which should be practically equal to the City of New York, is in a backward position. Why is it in that position?  It has a Cambridge that equals Rathmines and it has an Everett the equivalent of Pembroke, yet Boston remains the fourth or fifth city in the State instead of being the second or third. If we pass the Second Reading of this Bill it will do something for the capital of our country, the city we are proud of.  It will bring Dublin into the position in which we would like to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been attacked from various angles.  I submit that no attack has been made upon it that could not be made on the Greater Boston Bill.  If we wish Dublin to be the type of city that I am sure we all would wish it to be, we should pass the Second Reading of this Bill, and later we could amend <Col N="1135" /> it in Committee in such a way as would make it just as we would like it to be.  I am, perhaps, the most junior member in the House in the matter of local government, but I suggest that in Committee the Government should grant a certain latitude to various members so that they may be able to carry out improvements in the Bill.  I appeal to Deputies not to wreck the measure simply for the purpose of wrecking, but rather to be constructive in their attitude.  We have people here saying that managing directors and managers under certain circumstances are all right.  I suggest that a managing director, if he is vested with authority, is all right.  I think Deputy Flinn agreed with me a moment ago that a managing director under certain circumstances could even be paid a big salary.  I ask the House to pass the Second Reading and, in Committee, to amend the Bill as may be thought fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As a citizen of Dublin I am not going to let pass Deputy Good's remark about the whitewashing of the old Corporation. I would like to remind the Deputy that it was the condition of things under the Corporation that existed before the 1898 Act was passed that gave Dublin the name of dear, dirty Dublin.  It took all the time of the democratically-elected body that was established in 1898 to remove that stigma.  Deputy Good and people of his class, who are apparently about to be reinstated in their old position by one of the provisions of this Bill, are the very people who gave the City of Dublin the world-wide name it had for dirt. Anybody who has lived in Dublin for the last thirty years, since the popularly-elected Council got control, knows that almost from the very start they endeavoured to improve the city in every possible way. Deputy Tierney said that the old Corporation practically did nothing. He did not live in Dublin all these years or he would know whether or <Col N="1136" /> not that was true.  If he did live through it he would know that the old Grand Jury and the crowd represented by Deputy Good in the Dáil ignored the wants of the people of the city.  Every one of the services in their time were a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The President and Deputy O'Kelly know that when they entered the City Corporation they had to take on the job of practically reconstructing the services of the city. At the period of the suppression of the Corporation they had the best main drainage in the world, a splendid waterworks and lighting second to none.  Deputy Good and his people objected to the richer townships being added to the Dublin Corporation; but the bankrupt townships were handed over, and the Corporation had to undertake sewerage, roads, lighting and other works, and I think Deputy Good ought to admit that.  I admit that his party were a small minority in the Corporation and could not have their way.  Consequently, we now hear him saying there is no need for a change and they want to be left alone.  They certainly do want to be left alone, because they have got what they want. They have got the President to surrender the policy he fought for for so many years.  He took from the citizens of Dublin the control of their own affairs.  Deputy Good and the party he represents have always been in conflict with the Dublin municipality. If we cared to do it we could point out in detail what has been done by the old Corporation. It is a gross scandal for any Deputy to make the remarks that Deputy Good has made except, of course, that when speaking of the old Dublin Corporation he had in mind the real old Corporation elected on the restricted franchise that is going to be again introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It certainly should have some effect on the Minister when he finds members of his own Party, particularly two resident in his constituency, one of whom at least must be a better judge of public opinion than the Minister himself, speaking against the Bill.  I believe that there <Col N="1137" /> is no man in the House less in touch with public opinion, or who cares less for it, than the Minister. Deputy Byrne gave the Minister a few matters to ponder about.  He told us&mdash;and we know it is a fact&mdash; that he knows what the opinion amongst certain sections of the people in Dublin is.  Even Deputy O'Higgins ran up the white flag and suggested that we can amend the Bill.  He said that certain sections are objectionable, but he urged that it should be given a Second Reading and then be amended.  Some people on this side of the House, including myself, voted for the Second Reading of the Cork Bill in the hope that it would be possible to amend it, and as an alternative to a continuation of the Commissioner system.  We thought, foolishly enough, it would be better to have some sort of council than none at all.  I think now that it would be much better to have carried on with the Commissioner, and not try to have a semblance of democratic control for what is really the Commissioner system.  That has been done in Cork, and that is what is going to be done here.  We also had Deputy McKeon joining in the chorus to let the Bill have a Second Reading, and that then things would be all right. The white flag is certainly up, and I think there is every chance, especially as the Independents are also against the Bill, that it will be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said another thing that appealed to me.  He wanted to know if there were powers given the council why all the talk about the commercial register. If the Bill is to go through as it stands, I admit that it is not worth any candidate's while going up.  But we have to debate the matter in the hope that the Bill will be thrown out.  That is the only reason I am wasting five minutes on it.  Certainly, after being told for two or three years that we were to get a great Bill this is the worst attempt I ever saw.  We have been told that the Bill is the work of experts.  Certainly it bears the stamp of being <Col N="1138" /> the work of experts&mdash;the permanent officials who simply do not want to be bothered with interference by the representatives of the people.  It is an expert Bill from that point of view.  There is no doubt about that.  I like the way Deputy Tierney spoke. He was very honest, and I think he should vote against the Second Reading, if he is to be logical.  Apparently he objects to having any elected person like a Lord Mayor at friction with the manager.  In his opinion that will take away from the efficiency of the new system. His plea was that as the manager is going to make the Bill such a great success the glory should be his.  I submit it is up to Deputy Tierney in view of such an opinion to vote for the continuance of the present system and against this Bill.  The Deputy was honest enough to say: &ldquo;Let us have the Commissioner system without any camouflage or talk about democratic control.&rdquo;  I think in that way he has been the straightest of all who spoke in favour of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the commercial register, it is proposed to give four seats to people with a certain valuation. I object to that on principle.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that if there was no objection to the principle, there is no reason whatever why there should be a limit, why it should begin at valuations up to £50 and stop at £250, or why, for instance, Messrs. Jacob or Messrs. Guinness should not elect the whole Corporation.  If the principle is right there should be no limitation. In Cork we know, as a fact, that the business element have got one-third of the representation.  We will assume the unlikely happening and that the twenty-five members mentioned in the Bill will be accepted. That would mean that you would have one-third of the people elected representing the business community which would amount to eight.  There would then be four extra members, making in all twelve, so that the commercial community would have practically fifty per cent. of the representation. <Col N="1139" /> The principle of giving people the plural vote is a negation of what we call democracy.  I am not a very strong upholder of democracy at all, but, as I said on the Cork Bill, when you are trying to get a democratic cover for this managerial system or Commissioner system, you ought to do it properly or leave it alone.  Let it be one man one vote or absolute autocracy.  The President will correct me if I am wrong, but when he was asked why the Government suppressed the Corporation I think he said that his Government had not done so.  I believe they did, and they must have had a reason for doing so.  I suggest the reason was that the Government would have faded away long ago if the Corporation had remained.</P>

      <P>Because the capital city would have had some way of expressing its opinion on how things were going on through the elected representatives of the city.  You would not have had the hand-picked crowd that you have now, who are not independent, who never were independent, and who are simply the playthings of the Minister and do what he says without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the manager's powers, I see there is one power he has not got.  I looked to see if there was one power he had not and I found it.  In Section 37 he has no power to appoint himself, and stranger still, he has no power to dismiss or remove himself.  I suppose the implication is that he will find the job so nice he will not think of resigning, or is the strict interpretation that he will not be allowed to resign?  That is one power the manager has not got. I do not know if there is any other. In the first clause of Section 49, the same power is given to the Council in Dublin as was given to the Council in Cork.  They can raise the money and the manager will spend it.  Deputy O'Higgins has told us that that is the power of the purse. <Col N="1140" /> I must say that if all I could do was to raise the money so that somebody else could spend it, I would not consider it a satisfactory power.  I do not think anybody else would either. The spending of the money is the real power.  The spending of the money in this case is going to be done by the manager.  As Deputy Flinn pointed out, the only power, in this connection, that the council has is the power that the head of a family would have to withhold supplies from his family.  In other words, the people elected by the city have the power to hold up the services of the city&mdash;a power which one may say they cannot possibly exercise.  No man will starve his family and no representative of any borough, town or county is going to persist calmly in holding up supplies&mdash;a course which would mean practically death to the place they represent.  There is really no power given there at all and it is only special pleading to say that there is power given.  There is a lot of talk about those reserved powers&mdash;the Shop Hours Act and all the rest&mdash; which mean nothing.  They are not worth talking about.</P>
    <P>It is taken for granted that this council, when elected, will know nothing whatever about how the affairs of the municipality ought to be administered.  One of the principal duties of the manager will be to tell them how to set about their work&mdash;especially if he is asked to do so.  But whether he is asked or not, that is one of his duties.  Deputy Byrne&mdash;I do not know what he will do when this question comes to a vote&mdash;spoke about the possibility of amending the Bill, particularly in one respect, which we considered important in connection with the Cork Bill.  He said that his idea of proper administration would be a small executive of elected people such as the Government is in respect of this House.  We tried to get that provision inserted in the Cork Bill.  We put in an amendment to provide that there should be a small board or executive committee of the Corporation and that was turned down.  We <Col N="1141" /> were beaten on that amendment, and I can tell Deputy Byrne that except he acts now it will be as futile to try to amend this Bill as it was to amend the Cork Bill.  If the Minister had been honest when he said that Cork City Bill was only an experiment and that the experience of the Cork Bill would be used in the framing of this Bill, he would have learned a lesson from it.  But we have in the Minister a man who is absolutely impervious to public opinion.  He does not care whether the Bill works or not, with the result that we have here the same Bill as before, but with the addition of the reactionary clause providing for the commercial register.</P>
    <P>There is no provision as to town-planning in this Bill.  It is an outrageous thing that in the twentieth century a landlord can do what has been done in North Dublin.  A thoroughfare which we understood some years ago was to extend to a certain district has been blocked up by a certain individual.  No powers are taken in this Bill to deal with that sort of thing.  Deputy O'Kelly told us about the great thoroughfare to which I have referred, along by Griffith Avenue.  At a point there it abuts on the Malahide Road, where there was a large field; it has been blocked because an individual who could have built on any spot took occasion to build at the particular spot at the end of the road.  As far as I hear, the Corporation has not power to stop him.  In the twentieth century there should be some attempt in a Bill of this kind to deal with matters of that sort, but it has not been touched at all.  The whole policy of the Corporation is to be decided by the manager, just as it has been decided in Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney said that the case for the City Manager was written broad in the streets of Dublin. That may be true about the principal streets, but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact&mdash;if he does not know it already&mdash;that since the Corporation departed from the system of direct labour on the roads, one new road of <Col N="1142" /> concrete laid down under the new scheme at Marino had to be pulled up in parts before three years had passed and re-laid by the Corporation by direct labour.  The parts that have not already been pulled up will have to be pulled up very soon.  I would like to know what redress the citizens have for that at present or what redress they will have for such occurrences under the manager system. At present, they have no redress. These things are done as they are done in Cork.  They will be done by the manager in the future as they have been done by the Commissioners here in the past.  Contracts will be given out; road and other work will be scamped and then the municipality will have to come along, pull up these roads and lay down new ones at the expense of the ratepayers. The Minister may say that some of these contract schemes are done on a maintenance basis.  In those cases, they are probably safeguarded, but in the case I refer to no such provision was made, with the result that rubbishy roads were laid down.  That would not have been possible if these matters could have been discussed by a council.  So far as I see from this Bill, they are outside the province of the council altogether.  The manager will be able to decide, just as the Commissioners have decided, what streets are to be cleaned and what streets are not to be cleaned.  I defy anybody who goes round the back streets of Dublin to say they are even as well swept as they were in the old days.  I make a point of going through those streets every day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the representatives of these districts are allowed to express the opinion of those who elect them as they were when the city was under the old system of the Corporation, and which should be the case under any system which pretends to be democratic, you are going to have all sorts of ill-considered schemes and neglect of areas, including those which cannot call attention to themselves as the main streets can do. Conditions are obvious in the main streets.  It is from their appearance that the whole city is judged by visitors or casual observers and by such people as the President brings round when he wants to show them the state of prosperity we are enjoying. Of course, naturally, these streets are sure to be attended to. The manager will not bother his head about the poor quarters, and <Col N="1144" /> unless you have the general policy of the council under the control of elected members the thing will be absolutely a farce.  Deputy Good made an appeal to have the Bill withdrawn.  I think that would be the best thing to do.  We do not want it withdrawn in order that the matter may be left alone.  Quite the contrary.  We want the Minister to produce something else besides this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is the best man to ask me that question.  I think abortion would be about the best thing to call it.  There are several items in this Bill that would be referred to in Committee, only that I am living in the hope that it will not go to Committee, and consequently I want to refer to some of them now.  I see there is a provision for public notices of what is about to be done, and that sort of thing.  The idea of that was that public representatives should certainly have some respect for public opinion, and if they have not that they would be taught a lesson when the proper time comes. When these things would be published they would have a certain effect upon the elected representatives, but it is useless to put in such a provision in a Bill like this when the person you appoint is a man who cares nothing whatever what the people of Dublin care for, and when the main consideration would be what the people in the Custom House think about it.  The Minister, who is undoubtedly out of touch with public opinion and always cares very little about it, would be very much in place in pre-war Russia.  He would be an ideal junker.  He cares nothing and knows nothing about his own constituency, which was made perfectly evident from the speeches delivered by members of his own party.  He knows nothing about it, and cares less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he ought to withdraw this Bill and have another go at it, and take into consultation somebody who knows something about what <Col N="1145" /> the people want.  Let him simply tell his permanent officials that they have a certain job to do, and that is carry out the orders of the Oireachtas.  Let him tell them: &ldquo;It is my job to tell you what the people want, and it is your job to carry that out.&rdquo;  If the Minister is not satisfied with the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Commission he can get a more suitable body, if it is possible to do so, to make recommendations.  I doubt if it is possible.  I do not suggest that he should take all the findings of the Greater Dublin Commission and adopt them.  I myself would not do so.  But he should pay more respect to them and less respect to those who carry on in the official way.  I am not sure that it would be much good for me to join with Deputy Good in his appeal to have the Bill withdrawn, but if the Bill were withdrawn the Minister would be doing good for his own Party. Advice of that kind would not be taken from me, but I give him this advice in good faith.  No doubt it will be very awkward for him, but we will be charitable.  I think that one of the amendments Deputy O'Higgins suggested would be ruled out in Committee as being against the principle of the Bill.  It would be too bad to put Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Byrne in the position of voting in favour of the Bill after they had spoken against it, but it would not be the first time that the Minister withdrew something he had just put before the House.</P>

      <P>I understood that there was no misapprehension on anybody's part so far as the necessity for introducing this measure was concerned.  It would appear, however, from the speech of Deputy Good that some case should be made for changing the existing state of affairs and for introducing a Bill which extends the boundaries of the City of Dublin.  If I might correct <Col N="1146" /> Deputies in a historical matter, I might say that the Commission reported more than three years ago. The date of the report is 29th November, 1926.  The Commission, which had on it very competent persons who gave very careful consideration to this matter, at least two of them being of very high commercial standing, came to the conclusion that an extension of the city boundaries should be made, and accordingly made a series of suggestions, if I might again correct Deputy O'Kelly, consisting of 95 in one case and, I think, seven in the other. Their proposal was that the boundaries of the present city should be extended.  It has been stated by many people that even if the Government were not to introduce this measure and were to leave things as they are, as soon as a council would be set up for the City of Dublin it would be inevitable that a Private Bill would be introduced on the part of the Corporation of Dublin for an extension of its boundaries; that an unanswerable case could be made for such an extension and for the inclusion within the area of the city of Rathmines, Rathgar and Pembroke. That procedure would be attended by very considerable expense.  In such a case both parties would incur considerable expense.  It is quite possible that, apart from the expenses so incurred, Rathmines and Pembroke would not get a better bargain than is given to them in this Bill.  If my recollection of the terms of the report is correct, we were not led to infer that there was to be any stabilisation of the existing rates paid in those two districts.  All the Commission did in that respect was to weight the representation in respect of Rathmines, Rathgar and Pembroke more effectually in so far as the representation of the whole of the extended area of the city would be concerned&mdash;a point which Deputy O'Kelly neglected to note, or perhaps overlooked in reading the report, and which I drew attention to last night.  The representation in respect of the old city was to consist of 38 members out of a total of 65 If the representation had been based <Col N="1147" /> upon population it would have been 47.  Other than that particular contribution towards the feelings of Rathmines, Rathgar and Pembroke, no other great consideration was given to the matter in the course of this report.  It is for the people of Rathmines and Pembroke to make up their minds fairly rapidly as to whether or not inclusion in the area of the City of Dublin is not inevitable in any case, no matter what happens, no matter what Government is in power, no matter what Corporation is elected in the city, or whatever regulations are going to be prescribed in respect of the new government of the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government proposals differ from the report in quite a number of respects, but running through the whole measure very careful consideration is shown towards the recommendations in the report.  Practically every one of the provisions in the Bill is founded on some recommendation or other in the report. There has been variation.  Unlike our friends opposite, we are not bound by expert opinion in respect of advice tendered to us from any source.  We consider ourselves rather as judges than the advocates of a particular policy.  I would have preferred in connection with the consideration of this Bill if the two leading lights of the Fianna Fáil Party had considered this matter from the point of view of representatives of the country rather than representatives of the City of Dublin. It would appear from the speeches of both Deputies that Dublin was being robbed of its territory, when it is actually being extended.  To whatever would be taken from the county, whatever disturbance might result from the operations of the report to any or all of the local authorities in the county, they were absolutely indifferent. If the report had been adopted the valuation of the County Dublin would have been reduced from about £960,000 to a little under £300,000 and a very considerable impost would have been added to the burdens which the County Dublin <Col N="1148" /> has to bear.  If there is one part of this country that has benefited more than another in respect of the events of the last fifteen or twenty years it is the City of Dublin.  I am a Dublin citizen born and reared, although I live in the county, and I have much more valuable interests in the old city than I have in the county.  In connection with the proposals which we put forward in this measure, we have had to take into account what the effect of the recommendations of the Commission would have been in respect of the other portions of the County Dublin if the report had been accepted and put into the form of a Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass last night expressed surprise that a coastal borough was being set up and that the city was not extended in that direction.  He mentioned that there were various services common to both.  Amongst the services he mentioned were water, drainage, registration of jurors, reformatory and industrial schools, food inspection, etc.  I do not know how one could say that any one of these services is common.  They might tap the water-pipes. I agree they could get water, because it comes from a place beyond the boundaries of the area of any of these particular local authorities. There are two separate drainage systems; in fact, one might almost say three separate drainage systems.  The other services that he mentioned&mdash;registration of jurors, reformatory and industrial schools, food inspection, and so on, come within the function of the county council, and the proposed coastal borough is not getting these services. Deputy O'Connell fell into much the same mistake when he said that we were setting up vested interests.  So far as the urban districts of Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey, Killiney and Blackrock are concerned, it is as if the four were made one.  There is concentration in connection with their administration, and a saving in respect of the concentration that will take place, and there is kept within them the services which are common.  They <Col N="1149" /> are a unit; they are capable of being amalgamated together; they serve their own purposes without any such disturbance as would occur if they were included in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Right through most of the criticism I have heard there has been an absence of study of the problem of local government; of the complexities of local government, and of the practice in respect of it.  I was rather appalled to hear the discussion that took place in connection with the rates&mdash;that there was no power over the rates.  However, I can deal with that later.  The position then is that after due and careful consideration, and a balancing of the problem as it stands, not in respect to one local authority alone, but with due regard to economy of service and the efficiency which would result from combining those services, combining certain areas, the proposals in the Bill will stand any examination and the most careful analysis that any expert in local administration could possibly bring to bear upon them, and they will come out better than any other recommendations made.  I think Deputy Lemass went on to say that even the recommendations in the Commission's report were not enough for him&mdash;that he would have gone further.  I have often associated Deputies opposite with Imperialistic motives in another guise. It is quite possible that if this country contained a sufficient number of uncertified persons to put them into power they would forget all about their democracy, and all the rest, and seek to set up an Imperial concern for Western Europe, embracing Spain, France, Great Britain, etc., all to be under the sway of the Fianna Fáil Imperialists.</P>

      <P>So much for the first part of the report.  I now come to the new franchise which has been objected to by Deputies opposite.  I could quite understand some of the criticism if this new franchise had been added to the other, and the representation <Col N="1150" /> in respect to the twenty-five members came out of an alteration in the franchise.  That is not the case.  Some time ago a number of advertisements appeared in this country with reference to a proposal to establish a new paper.  It was to be controlled in respect to 51 per cent. of the property by an individual who was to be manager.  Associated with him in that control were five other business men, all selected from the point of view of their business knowledge and so on.  I went through the list very carefully and I found one Gael amongst the lot of them.  From the benches opposite we have been continually told about the number of sons of foreigners who are friends of ours here.</P>

      <P>What does the report say in connection with the matter?  It makes two references to it in two separate paragraphs. Number one, it expresses the view that directors of companies might get the vote; in another place, it suggests that when the estimates are being prepared it will be open to representatives of the ratepayers to come in and discuss the estimates. Now we have gone one better than that.  During long experience that I have had in connection with municipal administration we had very often deputations from the ratepayers. <Col N="1152" /> I think there was an association at one time brought into existence to express the views of the ratepayers and when the estimates were being prepared or the rates being struck they asked for a considerable sum to be taken off, explaining that the business of the city was being hampered by excessive rates and so forth.  Our desire is to save all that time and get down to business and let business men be associated with the making up of the estimates.</P>

      <P>We will take it for a moment that the new council is to be elected.  I, unfortunately, am not entitled to be elected.  We will assume that there was no such disqualification and that I became a member of the council, and I was satisfied in respect of, say, the paving of Westmoreland Street, that it should be done in wood blocks. I make representations to the manager to that effect.  The manager says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I hand in notice of motion asking the manager to prepare an estimate in respect of Westmoreland Street and submit it to the council.  Here is where the crux comes in.  We have two streets&mdash;let us call one Lemass Street and the other O'Kelly Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The council, on the other hand, says: &ldquo;No, Lemass Street is a much more fashionable thoroughfare; it should be kept in perfect order and it should be renovated.&rdquo;  The manager objects, and says Lemass Street is going to be opened up in <Col N="1154" /> respect of water mains, electric mains, perhaps in connection with main drainage within the next three years and it is a waste of money to do it.  He backs O'Kelly Street, and O'Kelly Street is renovated.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Surely it is not to be expected that the council should frame estimates.  The council is not the executive body.  The council is the directing body.  They are on policy.  It is for the manager to carry out this section of the Bill. If the council were to carry it out every member should carry it out. Should not the Lord Mayor do it then?</P>

      <P>In that case, you have the case of the two streets I mentioned&mdash;O'Kelly Street and Lemass Street&mdash;and the direction from the council in respect to these. It so happens it ought not to be always the business of members of the council to put up these recommendations. They come in in the ordinary way from the engineer. The engineer should submit to the council each year a list of the streets which he thought should be renovated, reconstructed, rebuilt, or made, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, if the Deputy would allow me, blind alleys are not taken over by the Corporation unless in perfect order.  I do not wish to be misunderstood in connection with the matter. Normally, the estimates come up from each Department.  If the members of the council so desire to alter, amend, modify or anything else of the sort, there is their authority, and if there is a doubt in respect of the authority of the members in connection with that let us see how Deputies would resolve it, how they would recommend something additional to be put into the measure in order to insure that, because I accept completely what the Minister said in respect of the council, the executive and the manager.

      <P>There was occasionally running through some of the speeches from the Deputies opposite a remarkable appreciation of their own capacity to pass judgment on other people and judgment was passed on those who were dead and gone long since.  I do not think it is good taste.  I do not think the circumstances warrant it.  If we take Dublin City as an example of growth, with a municipal mind, a big mind, there is to the credit of those persons who are condemned by Deputy Boland great works.  There have been no greater works than the Vartry Waterworks and they are constructed now for something like 65 or 70 years.  It may be that it is forgotten, but the one individual more responsible than any other in respect of that I think was Sir John Gray.  His son was afterwards a brilliant member of Parliament and Lord Mayor, that is to say at the time when the Corporation was elected on a poor law valuation basis.</P>

      <P>It stopped shortly after we left it.  Similarly with regard to main drainage.  I remember reading many years ago about the inauguration of the main drainage system.  As far back as 1868 the first proposals in that connection were before the Corporation, but unfortunately the Franco-Prussian war intervened, sending up prices.  In the year 1873 the Corporation had permission to raise £350,000 in conjunction with Rathmines and Pembroke. They found that owing to the war, prices had gone up, and instead of an anticipated cost of £400,000 they got a tender for £700,000.  At the time these two bodies were together, Rathmines and Pembroke, and so on.  Rathmines left and to their credit it must be said that they inaugurated main drainage for Rathmines, previous to the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Deputies may think I am irrelevant in introducing this matter, but I want to assure Deputy Good and other unbelievers in Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar that they are not being taken in but rather that the motherly cloak of the City of Dublin is going to be thrown around them.</P>

      <P>It so happened that although that work was done at very considerable expense by Rathmines and Rathgar that it was not so well done as the main drainage of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be interesting in view of some of the remarks passed yesterday by Deputy O'Kelly to see what marked improvement there has been in the health of the City of Dublin <Col N="1158" /> over a period of about 40 years.  In the year 1879 the death rate was 37.5 per 1,000; in the year 1880 37.89.  Now we come to the quinquennial periods.  From:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1881 to 1885 it was 30.3;</P>
    <P>1886 to 1890 it was 28.7;</P>
    <P>1891 to 1895 it was 29.2;</P>
    <P>1896 to 1900 it was 30.3.</P>
    <P>We will see the effect of the main drainage system.  From 1901 to 1905 it was 24.8 and from 1906 to 1910 23.1.  Now we will see the effect that Deputy O'Kelly and myself had upon the city.  From 1911 to 1916 it was 22.3.  From 1916-20 when Deputy O'Kelly was virtually absent from the country it was 21.6.  Then since the happy blessings of the setting up of the Saorstát, 16.3, a marvellous improvement! It is into that healthy city that we are inviting Deputy Good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few.  Nearly all died at home.  It is much more comfortable.  The death rate is decreasing. May I occupy your attention just for a moment to deal with one particular item in the report which I think crept in unintentionally at the end of Section 79.  The report goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;According to the statistics of the Department of Justice, the alien influx through Cobh alone has increased during the past year from 6,302 in 1924-5 to 7,389. The City Manager should have power to frame regulations whereby the Gárda Síochána would demand from new arrivals in Dublin such particulars as are now demanded from strangers in all the towns of Western Europe; to reject undesirables; and to limit by licence the period in which other immigrants would be permitted conditionally to remain.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact what they have got out there, strangely enough, is a figure showing the effects of the tourist problem.  Those are, I should say five-sixths of them, Americans, and the number is growing, I am <Col N="1159" /> glad to say, from 7,389 in 1925 up to 11,000 last year.</P>
    <P>It is not an alien problem at all. I would like to correct that, because I am sure the Commission did not wish to mislead anybody.  Mention was made last night of an enormous sum of money now owing by the City of Dublin, and it was stated that the dead-weight debt, or whatever one likes to call it, had gone up in the last five or six years to the extent of a sum of two million pounds.  The facts are that for the year ended 31st March, 1924, the total indebtedness of the city was £2,832,773.  That sum consisted of two items.  One is called reproductive debt and the other unproductive debt.  In the case of reproductive debt the amount was £1,932,904 7s. 3d., and in the case of the unproductive debt, £899,867, and a few odd shillings. The total capital invested on the 31st of March, 1929, was £4,452,725, consisting of a reproductive debt of £3,618,837 15s. 1d., and an unproductive debt of £833,887.  It will be observed, therefore, that the total increase in indebtedness between the years 1924 and 1929 is £1,619,952.  If my recollection is correct, Deputy O'Kelly mentioned £2,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Reproductive debt means debt incurred for undertakings which represent tangible assets and unproductive debt represents expenditure in respect of which no receipts are available other than rates imposed on the citizens for their maintenance.  This sum that I have mentioned is further subdivided. There has been an increase in respect of indebtedness on housing of £1,497,826.  Advances made under the Small Dwellings Acquisition <Col N="1160" /> Act, which should be added to that, amounts to £138,152.  There has been a slight increase in the capital indebtedness in regard to public health, namely, from £37,000 to £56,000, mainly due to the construction of an abattoir, and for waterworks in respect of the completion of the reservoir which was necessitated by housing schemes on the north side.

      <P>I am not very far off the mark and, if the Deputy wishes, I will have it examined and submitted to him.  The point is that, however rhetorical these statements may sound which were made last night, they have a bad effect.  They depress business, they depress industrialists and manufacturers, and they depress Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar, who will say that it is not worth while coming in.  I want, however, to invite them in quite cordially.  In respect of housing, somebody asked what rights the council would have in respect of schemes.  Supposing the council met and wanted to make up its mind in regard to housing and, if the manager is engaged in preparing a scheme, the council can ask to see it. There is a direction by which the Lord Mayor can ask the manager to produce anything, but if that provision is not sufficiently strong we can strengthen it so that it will have all the characteristics of an ironclad, <Col N="1161" /> impervious to attack or assault of any kind.  If they are dissatisfied, either in regard to the number or size of houses, they can say so, but for goodness' sake do not put us in the position, after the manager and everybody else have been engaged for months in preparing a scheme, when the scheme has been proposed, that somebody gets up with a footy objection and says, &ldquo;We will not give the money.&rdquo;</P>

We listened to two or three cases in respect of Cork, but into their merits I am not going to go.  We will accept the statement that there is a question regarding a stone bridge, and that the manager said that he was going to put up a concrete bridge.  Now, mark this difference, as between putting down concrete in the estimates last year, allowing a sum of £1 for it, and putting down £20 as the cost of a stone bridge. The manager must insist on concrete, or allow the work to stand over for twelve months and put sufficient provision in the estimates which will cover the cost of the work being done in stone.  Is that clear?</P>

      <P>I told the Deputy in respect of borrowing money that the council had authority.  I asked the Deputy to suppose that there is a meeting, that Deputy O'Kelly has been elected Lord Mayor, and that I say: &ldquo;Lord Mayor, have you approached the City Manager in respect of any plans or schemes you <Col N="1162" /> have for housing?&rdquo;  He will say: &ldquo;Yes, I saw him.  He has a scheme consisting of 50 houses for Donnycarney, 100 for Crumlin and 500 for the Bull Wall.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass then says: &ldquo;I want 300 at Crumlin,&rdquo; and the Lord Mayor says: &ldquo;He is only putting up 100 there, as that is all the grant he got.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;I will insist on getting more land acquired in order to provide 400 more.&rdquo;  The manager, having got notice, then goes to provide the necessary money for the scheme, otherwise a complaint can be made against him by the council.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  In connection with the other matter of spending money, supposing there was a sum of £5,000 allocated to the pulling down of gas lamps in Grafton Street&mdash;that is, supposing they were there&mdash;and replacing them by electric standards and it is provided in the estimates.  If the manager does not do that duty within a certain time it is open to the Lord Mayor to draw attention to it and to bring that dereliction of duty before the council, and, if the council is dissatisfied&mdash;I do not mean to say that they should be dissatisfied on small things but on matters affecting major considerations&mdash;and if you get a two-third majority&mdash;I am sure you would, because I do not think that Deputy Good would stand for hanky-panky on the part of the manager&mdash;the manager will have to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Bill from the beginning.  It is in that portion of the Bill that deals with the estimate.  It is in that portion which makes him responsible to the Lord Mayor, who can ask him for any information in respect of schemes.  I have just got the figures in respect of valuation regarding which I was queried by Deputy Lemass and I find that I made an excellent shot.  The figure is £109,000.</P>

      <P>I will stand an examination with any member of the Fianna Fáil Party in connection with this measure or with local government.  Let us understand one thing.  There was nothing but politics talked on the Bill since its introduction. Members wanted to know what subscriptions we were getting in connection with this Bill. I do not know whether any party will agree with it, but I do not think that any party can charge us with having pandered to popular feeling in the last seven or eight years.  It is in that sense and with that sense of responsibility that we submit the Bill.  We could easily have broken it up into two or three parts and get it through the House, but we have done the courageous thing and have introduced the measure in this form.  The work that this new council can do, when it is established, the new orientation of areas which will occur, and the potentialities of the new organisation, will justify the policy of the Minister in introducing the Bill.</P>

      <P>If there is one thing in which the President shines <Col N="1164" /> more than another it is in debating strategy.  When he began his speech he devoted himself more or less to the proposals in the Bill.  He dealt in a superficial and cursory way with the coastal borough, then he proceeded to defend the commercial register, and when he had led us down what Deputy Lemass described as Cosgrave's Blind Alley, he told us that business men were to be brought into the council in order to help in framing the estimate, but then he immediately skidaddled and endeavoured by picturing Dublin as a modern health resort to induce Deputy Good to forego his objections and to vote for the Bill.  I would like, if I could, to bring the President back to the portion of the Bill which was immediately under discussion when he sat down, and I would like him, while I am on my feet, to refer me to a section which I can read to the House which will unmistakably and clearly give to members of the council the power of framing the estimate.  The President referred us to Section 69 and I asked him to read that section, but he evaded doing so.  I would like to read it now so that the President may know what the section prescribes. Section 69, sub-section (1) says: &ldquo;The Manager shall cause to be prepared in each local financial year at the prescribed time and in the prescribed form an estimate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt for a moment?  We will assume that I am wrong and that the Deputy is right.  If the Deputy wishes to interpret my point of view into that clause what would he say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not interpret the President's point of view into that clause unless I was going to read into the Bill something which is not there.  It is a primary rule of legal interpretation that you should read the text in the ordinary sense.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The council shall cause to be prepared at the prescribed time and in the prescribed form an estimate.&rdquo;  It is, however, the Manager who will prepare, or cause to be prepared, the estimate and not the council.  It is the Manager who will give the estimate its first form and shape, whatever other powers the council have afterwards to modify or amend, and if they have powers to modify or amend the estimate they are definitely limited, not only by the circumstances and by the exigencies of local administration but by the Bill itself.  The President wishes the House to understand that because of sub-section (6) the council has absolute control over the policy of the Manager.  Take a case in point.  Suppose the Manager decides that he is going to raise money for a housing scheme and that the houses are going to be of a particular type. He then goes to the council and says: &ldquo;I want you to strike a rate of so much, to cover interest and sinking fund in connection with the scheme.&rdquo;  The council say: &ldquo;We will not strike that rate because we do not believe that these houses are of a proper type and are going to meet the requirements of the people in that district.  Therefore we will not strike the rate.&rdquo; What is the position?  The people want houses.  The Manager says that he will build them houses of a particular type.  The council will be put into a false position before the people when they will not vote the money to meet the service of the loan for this particular type of house which the Manager desires but which the council, as representing the people, do not think suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the position of the council in that dilemma?  On the one hand, they have the Manager, who will be able to appeal over their heads to the people and say &ldquo;At any rate, I am going to give you some sort of house.&rdquo;  On the other hand, they have people wanting houses, and in that position what is left to the council but to surrender and to accept the policy dictated by the Manager and not laid down by them? <Col N="1166" /> You could multiply instances of that sort.  Everybody knows that municipal services must be carried on, sanitary services must be carried on and, supposing the council are of opinion, at any time, that these services are not being carried out in a suitable manner and in a way best adapted to the requirements of the city, can the council refuse, no matter how strong it may be in that belief, to strike a rate for those sanitary services and consequently suspend them?</P>
    <P>Why if they did that, immediately there would be an outcry.  The health of the citizens, the Manager would say, is imperilled by the obstinacy of this council.  The council, willy-nilly, no matter what it thought, no matter what the powers which the President, in order to mislead the Dáil, said they have over policy, would again be compelled to yield to the Manager.  I admit that sub-section (6) does give them power to modify and amend certain estimates. But sub-section (7) of the Bill, unless I am wrong, virtually compels them to accept that estimate at a subsequent meeting which must be held within fourteen days after the meeting at which the original estimate is amended or rejected.</P>
    <P>The President, in order to sustain the case which he made that the council has complete power over policy, referred the House to section 50 of the Bill.  The fact that he referred to that section, and that obviously he was prompted to do so by some of his colleagues on the Government Bench proves that neither he nor they have read the Bill, with the possible exception of the Minister for Local Government, because that section deals entirely with the question of the appointment of the Manager and his powers.  Sub-section (1) of section 50 states that &ldquo;before the appointed day the appointment of a person to be a Manager shall be made by the Minister on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners,&rdquo; and so on.  Sub-section (3) provides that the Manager shall hold office until he dies, <Col N="1167" /> resigns or is removed from office, and sub-section (7) provides &ldquo;that the Manager may do all such matters and things, including the making of contracts for and on behalf of the Corporation and the affixing of the official seal of the Corporation to documents, as may be necessary for or incidental to the exercise or performance of any of the powers, functions and duties of the Corporation which are by this Act required to be exercised or performed by the Manager.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President quoted that section in order to sustain his argument that the council would have control in matters of policy.  He said that powers with regard to policy are reserved to the council, and that the function of administration is delegated to the Manager.  He quoted this section in support of that argument. If there is one thing that is clear from the sub-section I have quoted it is that all the powers of the Corporation, except those expressly reserved to the council, are delegated to the Manager to be exercised, discharged and fulfilled by him.  That is the effect of the sub-section which the President quoted in order to, as I have already said, sustain his argument that the council would have control over questions of policy.  Under this sub-section the Manager can, without the consent of the council, enter into contracts which he considers are &ldquo;necessary for or incidental to the exercise or performance of any of the powers, functions and duties of the Corporation which are by this Act required to be exercised or performed by the Manager.&rdquo;  These powers to be exercised by the Manager include every possible power or function the Corporation had, with the following exceptions:</P>
    <P>(a) the making of any rate or the borrowing of any moneys; (b) the making, amending or revoking of any bye-law; (c) the making of any order and the passing of any resolution by virtue of which any enactment is brought into operation in or <Col N="1168" /> made to apply to the city or the borough (as the case may be) and the revoking of any such order and the rescinding of any such resolution; (d) the application to be made to any authority in respect of the making or revoking of any such order as aforesaid; (c) the making or revoking of any order under section 5 of the Shops Act, 1913 (in that Act referred to as the Closing Order); (f) the powers conferred by section 5 of the Borough Funds (Ireland) Act, 1888, in relation to the promotion or the opposing of legislation, the prosecution and defence of legal proceedings, and the application for those purposes of the public funds and rates under the control of the Corporation; (g) the appointment or election of any person to be a member of any public body; (h) Parliamentary and local elections; (i) the admission of persons to the freedom of the city or the borough (as the case may be); (j) subject to the provisions of this Act, the appointment, suspension and removal of the Manager and the granting of an allowance or gratuity to the Manager on his ceasing to be the Manager; (k) the determination of the amount of the salary and remuneration of the Lord Mayor or Mayor (as the case may be); (1) applications to the Minister for a Provisional Order under this Act extending the boundary of the city or the borough (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>With these exceptions the Manager, as I said before, can do everything that the Corporation under its charter or subsequent Acts of Parliament has the power to do, or is obliged to do.  In doing that he can enter into a contract without a shadow of control or an iota of restriction being imposed on him or exercised over him by the City Council.  In fact, though the council will have the responsibility for finding the money and facing the citizens when it strikes a rate to <Col N="1169" /> find the money, it will be powerless to interfere with the Manager when he enters into a contract for the building of houses, making roads, the extension of drainage schemes or provision of water supplies, or when he determines that the city shall be extended in one direction or another.  The City Council, which will have the responsibility for facing the citizens and asking them to provide the money to defray the costs of these works, will not be able to intervene by advice, criticism or authority between the Manager and those with whom he enters <Col N="1170" /> into contracts in relation to these matters.  It is quite obvious, therefore, no matter what the President may say, no matter what the Minister for Local Government may urge upon this House, that the council as such is going to have no real control over the Manager so far as matters of policy are concerned.</P>
