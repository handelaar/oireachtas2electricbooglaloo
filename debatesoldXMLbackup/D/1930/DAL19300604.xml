      <P>Yes, I shall deal with it as rapidly as possible.  I should like to point out that the Grain Inquiry proved much heavier than the members of the Tariff Commission anticipated when they took it up. Seventeen public sittings have had to be held to deal with it and a large number of private sittings.  But for that, this particular report would have been issued before now.</P>

The police, as a matter of courtesy, called upon Mrs. Skeffington and asked her if she knew Francis Breen and if she would have any objection to state if she was related to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That in order to remove doubts it is hereby declared and enacted that for the purpose of determining liability for assessment to and payment of income tax, the Electricity Supply Board is not and never was the State or a branch or Department of the Government of the State.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the annual value with reference to which tax is to be charged under Schedules A and B of the Income Tax Act, 1918, in respect of any tenement or hereditament in the exclusive possession or control or the occupation of the Electricity Supply Board and for the time being exempt from assessment to poor rate shall be ascertained according to the surveys and valuations made under the Valuation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always intended that the Electricity Supply Board should be liable to income tax.  That was stated by the Minister in this House and in the Seanad, and, of course, <Col N="401" /> it was also told to the Board, but, in consequence of legal advice which has been received, there seems to be some doubt as to whether the intention was carried out or not.  While the Board is apparently advised that it is not liable to income tax, the Revenue Commissioners are advised that it is liable, and whatever the decision of the Court may be, the position is, that without legislation litigation would take place and this resolution, which will be embodied in an amendment to the Finance Bill, is introduced.  We are quite clear that the Electricity Supply Board ought to be liable to income tax.  In the first place, it is to a certain extent in competition with private firms.  It is in competition, for instance, with gas companies which are liable to income tax.  It is in competition with firms which are engaged in the wiring of houses and the selling of electrical appliances which are also liable to income tax.  It has taken over a number of private concerns which are making profits to the extent of about £120,000 per annum and which are liable to income tax.  It is felt on all grounds that the Electricity Supply Board should have the same liability to income tax as these competing firms and as concerns whose works it took over and as, in fact, an ordinary commercial firm running a scheme of this nature.  As I say, the object of the resolution is to remove doubts which have been raised and to give effect to an intention which has been on previous occasions expressed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreeable to the passage of this resolution.  As the Minister has said, it would not be right that a concern which is in competition with privately owned concerns in the State such as gas companies and electrical equipment suppliers should be subsidised by the taxpayer in order that it may be able more effectively to compete with its rivals.  We also support the resolution on the ground that it would be wrong to ask the general taxpayer to subsidise the consumers <Col N="402" /> of electricity in the State and thus make it possible for them to get electricity at a lower rate if the subsidy were sufficiently large.  I would like, however, to ask, if many more resolutions of this kind are to be tabled, that Ministers would refrain from criticising Bills from private members on the ground that they are badly drafted.  If Ministers, with the assistance of large Departments and the official draftsmen, are unable to produce Bills which will not give rise to doubts as to their meanings, private Deputies cannot be expected to do so.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether or not this income tax relief applies to interest and sinking fund in connection with the money issued for the use of the Electricity Supply Board and what the total amount of tax involved in the matter is?  Before we do pass a resolution of this kind we certainly ought to know the size of the sum involved.  I would also like to know whether or not any application has been made to the Electricity Supply Board for income tax and if they have in fact declined to pay it.</P>

Here we have a retrospective resolution which says that the Electricity Supply Board are not and never were, in fact, exempt from income tax.  That is introduced by saying it is to remove doubt, but if, in fact, the advice which apparently has been given to the Electricity Supply Board that they were in fact exempt from income tax under the existing law is sound, what is the position of that law when we have simply passed a declaratory resolution which says they are not and never were exempt?  Does a resolution of this kind take precedence of the law?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it was never intended to exempt the Electricity Supply Board from income tax and that was repeatedly stated, but there has been legal advice offered to the Electricity Supply <Col N="404" /> Board that the electricity supply undertaking constitutes a State undertaking or is in the position of a Department of State and consequently is not liable to tax.  There was an application made to the Electricity Supply Board in respect of income tax on the undertakings which they had taken over and they stated that they were advised that they were not liable.  If the Electricity Supply Board were advised by their legal advisers that they were not liable to pay, of course it was their duty to act on that advice.  The position therefore has arisen that litigation in default of legislation carrying out the intention of this resolution would necessarily ensue. It might result in the Board being found liable to income tax or it might result in the Board being found by the courts to be not liable to income tax.  We are not waiting until that litigation has been fought out at considerable expense.  We are introducing this resolution in order that the position might be as it was always intended it should be, that the Board should be liable to tax.</P>
      <P>There are various reasons why it is difficult to say what amount exactly is involved and we are really concerned here with the principle that this Board should pay the tax for which they are liable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The loud laughter that bespeaks the vacant mind.&rdquo; Put it the other way.  Before the Minister asks the House to put upon the Electricity Supply Board a liability surely he ought to have taken the trouble to find out what that liability is.  Do I understand the position is that the Electricity Supply Board have refused to pay income tax until it shall be made clear to them that it is legally due.  If that is the position when does the Minister propose to proceed against the Electricity Supply Board for embezzlement?  The word embezzlement <Col N="405" /> is applied generally to those who refuse apparently, according to the Minister, to pay debts until it has been ascertained that those debts are legally due.  As far as I can understand from the Minister now the Electricity Supply Board set up by him is in precisely that position.  Does he intend to apply to them the term &ldquo;embezzlement&rdquo; which he applies to his political opponents in precisely the same circumstances?  Again, I ask what is the amount?  As far as I know the Board will have directly to pay the interest and sinking fund on about nine millions of monies.  What is the income represented by the interest and sinking fund on that amount and what is the amount of income tax which they are now going to put on the Electricity Supply Board by this means?  Before the House is asked to put on the Electricity Supply Board a loan of that kind, which, apparently, has not been put upon it by law, it is the business of the extremely lazy Minister for Finance to take a little trouble to ascertain what that amount is and to tell the House.</P>

      <P>Before moving the Second Reading of this Bill I would like to see that the procedure suggested is satisfactory.  This is a Bill of fourteen clauses, some of <Col N="406" /> them related and some not related one to the other.  It depends for its explanation on the clauses themselves. What I propose to the House is not to have the debate on the Bill now, but to go through the clauses and make an explanation on each section, where the sections seem to call for explanation, and then, if it is thought that time is required for consideration of the Bill, to have the debate postponed, either to a later hour this evening or until to-morrow.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,561 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Tariff Commission (No. 40 of 1926).</P>
    <P>There is a slight change in this Vote as compared with that of last year.  Certain items which appear in the details for clerical assistants and fees for expert advisers were in the original Estimate last year.  When, however, the supplementary estimate was taken for allowances for members of the Commission the money was found largely from these two particular items which had not been used.  The result is that the net increase in the Estimate is not large, in fact it is very small.  The items for clerical assistants and experts have been inserted this year because there is a possibility that in regard to some of the applications before the Tariff Commission the money included under those heads will have to be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to the voting of this money, in the first place, because we object on principle to the establishment of a Tariff Commission of this kind at all.  I do not intend to deal with that matter at any length now as, presumably, I would not be in order in doing so. We think that the economic circumstances that exist in this State require the establishment of machinery for the consideration of applications for protection of an entirely different nature to that created under the Tariff Commission Act.  We are opposed to the Tariff Commission not merely on principle but also in practice.  We think that the existing body has proved itself extremely dilatory and, in so far as <Col N="408" /> it is dilatory, incompetent in its work.  The attitude of the members of the Commission towards applications for tariffs appears to be that it is their duty to make a case against the application except where the case for it is so clear that it cannot be opposed with any show of common-sense at all.  In other words, the bias of the members of the Commission appears to be definitely free trade.  Their attitude is similar to that of the Minister for Finance, namely, that tariffs should not be imposed except where the case for a tariff is overwhelming. That attitude is wrong. It should be in favour of protecting Irish industries except where it can be shown that the steps proposed in regard to any application would be more disadvantageous than advantageous to Irish industry.  We expressed the opinion before that this body was established to impede rather than to facilitate the imposition of tariffs.  It has worked out that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not tell us what applications are now pending or in the process of being heard by the Commission.  I would be glad if he would do so and also if he would indicate the various stages of decomposition which the different applications have reached.  I would like if he would tell us when he expects to have the report on the application of the coach builders. As he is aware, it is almost four years since that application was made.  It is certainly over three years since it was referred to the Tariff Commission, and the loss in wages to Irish workers occasioned by the delay in reporting on the application has been estimated at over £1,000,000.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question a few minutes ago the Minister for Finance admitted that the report on the application of the coachbuilders had been further delayed by the fact that the members of the Tariff Commission were appointed to conduct the Grain Inquiry.  At the time that the Minister was proposing to establish the Grain Inquiry the fact that the appointment of these members <Col N="409" /> would have that effect was forcibly pointed out from these benches, but the Minister took no notice.  We now find that the unemployment and the wastage of capital occasioned by the Commission's delay will be continued for another period.  There is work available in this country for almost 2,000 additional workers in the coach-building industry, if that industry is given an opportunity of developing here.  Deputies are no doubt aware that we have the facilities for developing that industry, but for three years it has been steadily declining while its representatives have been appearing before the Tariff Commission and pleading in vain for a speedy decision on their application.  Those engaged in the industry estimate that the loss in wages to Irish workers last year alone, due to the fact that protection was not afforded, was £400,000. There is not a tremendous amount of money available for the payment of wages to Irish workers, and such loss is particularly serious in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think that the Commission would be well advised either to scrap the Commission altogether and to get back to the position that existed before its establishment or to do as we suggest and establish not one but two Commissions so that the work could be expedited.  I would also be glad to know if the Minister would tell us the position in regard to the application for a duty on wrapping paper and whether there was any prospect of the report being available in a short time, within six or twelve months.  The Minister should also inform us of the progress of the Grain Inquiry.  Although there is no provision for that inquiry in the Estimate, the fact that members of the Tariff Commission are also conducting the work of the Grain Inquiry is impeding the work of the Commission.  The progress made in regard to the Grain Inquiry will indicate whether anything can be done next year or whether all the time of the Commission is to be devoted to dealing with special inquiries. No matter what the answer <Col N="410" /> of the Minister is, we are dissatisfied with the result of the Commission's work and will vote against the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister intends to adhere to the present system of hearing applications for tariffs, I suggest that that system would be improved by issuing interim reports.  There must be instances in which after a first examination the Commission would be in a position to recommend a tariff, perhaps a tariff limited to certain branches of the manufacture concerned. In the case of coach-building, for instance, I think that it must have been obvious, and that certain Ministers expected that it would be obvious, to the Commission that a tariff on farmers' carts and traps, commercial lorries, bus bodies, and so forth, would result from the hearing by the Commission.  I think with regard to these lines that the Commission must have had no difficulty in ascertaining the position.  One of the real reasons for the delay in issuing the report is, I take it, the very involved and intricate problem that surrounds the question of import duties on the bodies of private motor cars.  It seems, however, very unreasonable and a great hardship on those who manufacture bus bodies and farmers' traps if they must have their industry crippled and if, as is happening, the workers have to be disbanded simply because there has to be a delay in granting protection to them until the Commission has fully examined into another department of the industry&mdash;a department that is altogether different in its circumstances from the particular branches to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the inquiry into an application for a tariff on woollens, that must also have occurred.  It would seem that the Commission had no difficulty in making up its mind that a tariff on certain woollen goods was a desirable and necessary thing.  In that case, too, an interim report, recommending a tariff on certain woollen goods, might have saved the emigration of a great number of woollen workers and <Col N="411" /> might have resulted in a great deal of employment and a great deal of income, which was lost to this country through the long delay.  There is room for that improvement, at least, in the present system of inquiry, and I hope the Minister will give the suggestion consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the application for a tariff by the coach-builders.  I admit that since the Grain Inquiry was begun there has been a delay of which the applicants might complain.  Up to that, a number of these delays were due to action and inaction on the part of those who made the application. The Grain Inquiry is a special inquiry which is not conducted under the Tariff Commission Act. Although it does not actually propose a tariff, the application is really of the same nature as the applications that are made for tariffs.  It seemed to us that the Tariff Commission was the best body to carry out that inquiry, as the matters that would be submitted to it and the matters that would have to be decided were of the same sort as had been before the Tariff Commission in relation to manufacturing industry. Although it is a special inquiry, the Tariff Commission is, I think, doing as good work in investigating that particular matter as in investigating an industrial application.  The drafting of the report, I am informed, has reached a very advanced stage and the report is likely to be in my hands at a very early date. The same remark applies to the tariff on wrapping paper.  There is very little to be done to complete that report and it is expected to reach me even before the report on the coach-building application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only a comparatively small number of applications actually before the Tariff Commission at present.  The principal one is at present being dealt with&mdash;an application for a modification of the tariff on woollens, the modification being to lower the exemption limit. There is also coming up&mdash;I do not know what stage it has reached at <Col N="412" /> the moment&mdash;an application by the ready-made clothing manufacturers for an increase of the tariff in respect of their productions.  There is also before the Commission an application in respect of gold, silver and electro-plated ware.  There is an application in respect of cement which those making it would seem not to be proceeding with at the moment. A number of other applications have come to the Department of Finance and consideration is being given as to whether or not those sending in the applications are really substantially representative of the industries concerned.  There is nothing to indicate that you could find work for two Tariff Commissions, even if it were desirable to have two Commissions. I think that would not be desirable on general grounds, because you could not get two commissions which would have exactly the same outlook or which would pursue the same methods.  It would be undesirable to have one application considered by a commission which might look at things in one way and a second application considered by a group of men who would have a different outlook altogether.  Apart from that objection, there would not be work for two commissions. I dare say there would be plenty of work if applications were not thoroughly examined and if tariffs were recommended almost automatically as applications came in.  In that case, I have no doubt that all sorts of industries and sections of industries would roll up with applications. But if applications are to be examined impartially and seriously and if it is to be necessary to make a case, I think there are not going to be many more applications &mdash;at least not so many applications as would keep even one commission occupied full time, not to speak of justifying the appointment of a second commission.</P>
    <P>As regards the Grain Inquiry, I understand that the Commission's view is that there is not much more than a month or six weeks' work be fore them.  They have heard the grain growers' evidence and a great deal of time has been given, at private <Col N="413" /> meetings of the Commission, to consideration of that evidence.  They may possibly look for certain other evidence but that is not expected to take a great deal of time.  There will remain only the drafting of the report.  I understand that, as the matter has been the subject of discussion at quite a number of private meetings of the Commission, they believe it will be possible to present a report within six weeks or so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if all applications are dealt with in the order in which they are received? Is it not possible that, in the case of the cement application, the applicants finding that they might have to wait for two or three years for the result of their application, abandoned interest in the proposal, especially as it is understood they were not natives of the country?  Does the Minister not think that in a case like that there would be some advantage in guaranteeing that the application for a tariff would be considered within a certain time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for tariffs are made to the Minister for Finance, in the first instance.  They are considered, in so far as consideration is necessary, in the Department of Finance.  There is generally no great delay there.  In some cases, practically no consideration is necessary because it is obvious that those making the application are substantially representative of the industry concerned and are people whose application should be considered seriously.  The applications go, then, to the Tariff Commission and the Tariff Commission, after fixing the fee, requires the applicants to submit their detailed case.  It would be impossible to say that applications would be taken in any particular order.  Some applicants have been able to submit the detailed case very quickly and in very full and satisfactory form. Others have delayed very considerably in making the detailed application. There have been a great many instances in which, after the detailed application was sent in or <Col N="414" /> when the applicants were drafting their detailed application, the parties concerned desired to alter the scope of the tariff for which they had applied.  All sorts of delays have been occasioned in that particular way, so that the Tariff Commission has, in a sense, to deal with business as business offers.  Then, if it is a very complex matter, the members of the Commission may have not only to consider the detailed case before arranging the public hearing, but may have to seek a good deal of other information.</P>
      <P>In the case of the woollen inquiry the public sitting was postponed for a considerable time after the detailed case had been received. Nevertheless, an enormous amount of work was done by the members of the Commission before the public hearing.  Reports were obtained and various written authorities dealing with the industry were considered, so that although the public hearing was delayed, the report was not delayed at all.  I do not know that they could have dealt with the matter in any way other than they have done.  There was an application made in regard to cement. Then, for no reason that we are aware of, the applicants seem to have decided not to go on.  It was not in consequence of delay on the part of the Commission that that happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Tariff Commission has the power, in a case such as that of the cement application, to take into account that the people concerned must get a reply fairly quickly? Has the Commission the discretion to go ahead with a particular application if the circumstances seem to require expedition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  But I think that if such an inquiry as the Tariff Commission carries out is to take place it is impossible to have a decision within two or three months. The different stages involve delay. After the preliminary stages have been dealt with, the consideration of the detailed application involves <Col N="415" /> some study.  The Commissioners cannot simply read over the detailed application and proceed to a public hearing.  The position is like that of Deputy Lemass listening to the explanation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the Electricity Supply Bill.  In order that members of the Commission may get the benefit they ought to get from the public hearing, it is necessary that they should have given a fair amount of time to the study of the application in advance. After the preliminary hearing, it is necessary to give those who object to the application an opportunity of being heard.  It is impossible to do that, with fairness to them, within a week or two weeks.  There must be some delay.  It is generally necessary to hear the applicants again after the opponents of the application have been heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be some delay over that and, finally, there is the actual consideration of the case, the checking, the trying to find the truth between contradictory statements, and all that kind of thing.  So with the greatest possible speed, no matter how a case was being expedited and no matter how straightforward it was, it would not be easy to have it <Col N="416" /> dealt with very much within a year, if it could be dealt with at all within a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if he has made any inquiries as to the reason why it was possible for committees established by the British Board of Trade under the safeguarding proposals of the late Government to check and report on the safeguarding of industries in England in many cases did so within four or five months, in view of the fact that these industries are very much larger and more complicated than they are here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will appreciate that it would be a very serious thing if there were applicants for a tariff duty who were going to start a new industry that was not likely to be started with native capital, but who became discouraged by being told that they might have to wait two, three and even four years.  I think it would be very serious if there were lost an industry like artificial silk or cement or things like that through such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Kelly, I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The purpose for which we are moving the reference back of this Estimate is to give the Dáil an opportunity of expressing its view on the policy of the Government in relation to unemployment.  We have had numerous discussions upon this question of unemployment, and it might be thought that no useful purpose would be served by bringing it forward for consideration again.  We feel, however, that we cannot possibly endeavour too often to impress <Col N="421" /> upon the minds of Deputies the serious situation that exists in the country and the lack of success which has attended any effort made by the Executive Council to remedy that situation.  I think it will be generally admitted that the country is perturbed, and seriously perturbed, at the obvious failure of the Government, not merely to deal with the problem of unemployment but even to appreciate its seriousness. That uneasiness is not confined to any one section or class of the community; it exists among the supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party just as strongly as it exists amongst the supporters of other Parties.  The Government appear to feel that their duty is met if they periodically produce estimates in the Dáil which tend to show or to imply that the problem of unemployment is diminishing in extent.  Whether their failure to realise its seriousness is due to self-deception or to inadequate information, it has prevented the necessary amount of attention being given to it.</P>
      <P>It may be held, and it probably will be argued here to-day, that the Government has no direct responsibility for the unemployed.  As Deputies will remember, the attitude of the Government in this matter was expressed in the past in that form.  It is held that although the Government should do whatever it can to encourage industries and the initiation of schemes that would give employment, it has no direct responsibility to provide work for those who are without it.  That view is altogether at variance with the view held by Deputies on this side and by a large and growing section of the people, particularly by a number of those who are to be regarded as the most important industrialists in the State.  The people maintain and pay for the maintenance of the machinery of State&mdash;the Executive Council and the Oireachtas, the Civil Service and the police force, to ensure that their social, political and economic activities will be so regulated that their welfare will be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a large number of our people <Col N="422" /> are, as we know they are, destitute, the machinery of the State should be set to work in order to improve their conditions.  The machinery of State is not being so worked at the moment.  The State's obligation to its unemployed citizens is not discharged merely when it provides schemes for the granting of outdoor or institutional relief to those who are actually on the borderline of starvation.  It may be held that the Government has no function other than to see that nobody will die for want of food.  The Government has taken steps to ensure that such is the case.  Nobody need starve.  At the worst a person can go into the poorhouse and be provided for there or can throw a brick through a shop window and go to jail.  Nobody need starve in any case.  But I urge and maintain that the duty of the State is not discharged when it merely provides that there will be food available to keep persons from dying.  The State should take upon itself the duty of providing work at a wage that would enable all those willing to work to maintain themselves in decent comfort.</P>
    <P>Within this State a particular social order has evolved, and its evolution has been protected by the machinery of the State, maintained and paid for by the people. We give our resources in agricultural land, in minerals, in capital and in technical skill into the control of a number of individuals or groups of individuals to work and develop.  If, as a result of their efforts, a livelihood cannot be found for all our people in their own country, the State must step in and so alter the social order that the evils of unemployment and emigration will be either modified or removed entirely.  We do not know the extent of the unemployment problem here.  I do not wish to renew the complaints which we made quite recently concerning the delay in the publication of the census figures. No matter how plausible the excuses produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce may sound, we are convinced&mdash;and a very large <Col N="423" /> number of people in the country are convinced&mdash;that the publication of the figures relating to unemployment, ascertained by the census, was deliberately impeded because it was the view of those associated with the Party management of Cumann na nGaedheal that such publication would be detrimental to their interests. It is, in our opinion, amazing that such essential information collected in 1926 should not be available in 1930.  Various estimates of the number of unemployed have been made, not merely by persons associated with the different Parties in this House, but also by persons associated with charitable organisations. These estimates very from 50,000 to 75,000.  I do not intend to make any estimate, but anyone who has travelled through the country and discussed the existing situation with public men in different towns &mdash;and those men might be expected to know the truth&mdash;must be convinced that a serious unemployment problem exists here which has not been adequately attended to.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, associated with the problem of unemployment the kindred problem of emigration.  This country suffers a net loss of population through emigration every year which is four times heavier than that suffered by Great Britain, the next highest in Europe.  The existence of a big unemployment problem now is only a new phase of a problem which has existed for many years and is due to the fact that emigration no longer provides an adequate outlet for those who are unable to get remunerative work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Other countries have unemployment problems as well, although they differ in nature and extent from the problem which exists here.  In Great Britain and in the United States of America the seriousness of unemployment has aroused widespread public attention, and is, in fact, the subject-matter of important discussions in the legislatures of those countries.  Unemployment in Great Britain and America, however, is due <Col N="424" /> to causes which we do not find operating to anything like the same extent in the Free State.  In the first place, it is due to the fact that the home markets are saturated with the products of the industries of those countries to the limits of the purchasing power of the people. Various remedies for that situation have been advanced and novel suggestions are being discussed in different quarters to remedy and prevent the recurrence of such a situation.  It does not exist here, however.  If our markets are fully supplied with the goods we require, these goods are foreign and can be substituted by our own manufactures if we take steps to reserve the home market for them.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in Great Britain, the United States, and similarly situated countries has also been largely aggravated by improved methods of production, improved machinery, improved labour-saving devices which have been adopted and put into operation without any necessary consequential alterations in the working hours of those engaged in the industry.  We are, in fact, passing through a transition stage in industry.  The invention of a machine which enables the amount of work which 500 men do in a week to be done by half that number results in 250 men being dismissed and deprived of their livelihood, instead of resulting, as common-sense would seem to suggest, in the number of hours which the 500 men formerly had to work being reduced by one-half. Under social conditions as they now exist improved methods of production generally aggravate unemployment. They certainly have had that effect in Great Britain, Germany, America, and other countries.  That situation is not serious here, because our capacity to produce the goods we require is, in relation to many articles, much below our consumption of those goods.</P>
    <P>In other countries, also, the unemployment problem has been made more serious by the fact that foreign markets are contracting, due to the efforts of foreign Governments to <Col N="425" /> make their nations self-contained. That contraction of the foreign market has gone on while at the same time productive capacity and population have increased at home. That aspect of the problem does not apply here.  Our export trade is mainly confined to agricultural products. We have been repeatedly assured by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and in this matter, at any rate, he is possibly right&mdash;that our export trade in agricultural produce has by no means reached its maximum and that with improved marketing methods it would be possible greatly to extend it.</P>
    <P>In Germany there is a serious unemployment problem due to the same causes as those operating in Great Britain and America, but aggravated by the fact that the German Government has to pay in reparations to the Allies a sum which bears the same relation to its total State revenue as 21 bears to 100.  That particular situation is reproduced here and must be accounted for as one of the contributory causes of unemployment here.  We are paying to Great Britain, under the Ultimate Financial Settlement which the Minister for Finance negotiated in 1926, a sum which bears to our total State revenue a higher relationship than the amount which Germany pays in reparations to the Allies has to the total revenue of the German State. Reparations are 21 per cent. of the German State revenue; our payments under the Ultimate Financial Settlement are 24 per cent. of our total State revenue.  International economists of undoubted reputation and ability have met in solemn conference and decided that the payment of reparations is one of the main causes of unemployment in Germany. It is to be presumed that if these international economists met to consider the situation here they would conclude that the payments made under the Ultimate Financial Settlement form one of the main causes of the unemployment and emigration in this country.</P>
    <P>If we are going to consider methods of solving the unemployment problem we cannot leave out <Col N="426" /> of account the fact that this payment is being made.  I do not want to discuss now whether these payments need or need not be made. Deputies know that we urge, and a number of persons not associated with our Party whose ability to express an opinion cannot be denied also urge, that there is no international obligation existing binding us to pay the money.  Deputies on the other side insist that we should pay, whether they have any argument to support their case or not.  The money has been paid, and because it is being paid we have here an unemployment and an emigration problem of very considerable magnitude. Any responsible body that meets to consider the economic conditions prevailing here cannot leave out of account the Ultimate Financial Settlement payments.  The only way by which that particular cause of unemployment can be removed appears to be by removing the present Government.  I do not hope that this Dáil will do that; but this Dáil will not always have the sole power of deciding questions of that kind.</P>
    <P>Leaving that particular aspect of the problem aside and coming down to the consideration of the immediate cause of unemployment, we find that the outstanding fact concerning unemployment in this country is that it need not exist at all. Other countries in which the unemployment problem is as great if not greater than ours are facing up to the task of dealing with it.  The Ministers appear to be satisfied with suppressing information relating to its magnitude, or in so presenting that information as to delude the people concerning it.  Repeatedly the Minister for Industry and Commerce has come to the Dáil and endeavoured to present the number of registered unemployed in a manner which would lead people to understand that they represent the total number of those without work.  If there is a slight downward fluctuation in the number of registered unemployed the Minister and his colleagues shout loudly that the worst <Col N="427" /> has now passed; a way of dealing with the question has been found, and we have only to sit back with our hands in our pockets and leave the rest to Providence and everything will work out well.  Not merely are we failing to face up to our unemployment problem, but we are failing to do so, although it is much easier of solution here than in any other of the countries mentioned in the course of my remarks.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have repeatedly urged the necessity for protecting Irish industry from foreign competition and brought to the notice of Deputies the advantages that would accrue from the granting of that protection.  It must be admitted that the solution of unemployment depends in the long run upon the development of industry. Whatever can be done in the short run, if we are going to abolish unemployment as we now know it permanently from our national life we must take steps to ensure the development of industry here.  It cannot be done in any other way, except we reconcile ourselves to a permenent reduction in the number of people living in the country.  The development of industry will require capital, managerial ability and technical skill and we have them all. There will be difficulties undoubtedly in getting them to work, but these difficulties will disappear under the pressure of the demand in the home market, if that market is reserved for Irish enterprise.</P>
    <P>The extent of the home market can be easily estimated.  Certain puny efforts at protection have already been made by the Government and the results were so good that it is amazing the Government hesitate to follow them up.  The few and inadequate tariffs imposed in 1926 and since have given additional employment to just 13,000 workers in the protected industries.  The number of protected industries is few, the tariffs, in nearly every case, were too low and the imports of tariffed goods are still very high.  And yet, 13,000 workers, who would otherwise <Col N="428" /> be idle, are to-day earning good wages in consequence of the steps which the Government took under the pressure of public opinion.</P>
    <P>There are still imported into this country £18,500,000 worth of goods which are at the present time not merely capable of being produced but are actually to-day being manufactured within the country.  Leaving out of account goods capable of being manufactured here or goods capable of being substituted by our own products, there are imported into the Free State every twelve months goods to the value of £18,500,000 which are sold in competition with home products.  I include in that list such commodities as bacon, hams, flour, bread, slates, motor bodies, and woollen goods, particularly wearing apparel.  The net output per head of industrial workers in the Free State in 1926 was £225.  Each person engaged in industry in that year was responsible for a net output of £225.  The corresponding figure for Great Britain was £210.  If we calculate on the Free State figure, we find that the number of workers required to produce a net output valued at £18,500,000 is 82,000.  If we calculate on the British figure we get a number of 88,000.  I do not believe that there are 82,000 people unemployed in the Free State at present. It is obvious, therefore, that if we can ensure the production merely of these goods which we are in fact engaged in producing, although we are not fully supplying the home market, we shall be able to abolish the unemployment problem as it now exists altogether.  That can be done obviously by excluding the foreign goods.  I do not think that the exclusion of these foreign goods would have any deterimental effect upon the agricultural community.  It has been argued that protection increases the cost of living.  The inadequate measure of protection which the Government are responsible for has not, in fact, increased the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Since 1925, as I have had occasion to point out before, the cost of living in the Free State has fallen relatively <Col N="429" /> more than in Great Britain, America, France, or any country in Europe. Official statistics published by such bodies as the League of Nations, or statistics made available by journals like the &ldquo;Economist,&rdquo; are available to show that.  Even, however, if it can be argued that the cost of living might have fallen more than it did if these tariffs had not been imposed, it cannot be argued that protection has increased the cost of living.  Civil servants, who have had the cost of living bonus reduced since 1925, know that.  In any case the provision of such a large additional market to the Irish farmer as would be occasioned by the absorption of 82,000 additional hands into work would have such a good effect that he could afford to bear whatever little burden, if any, would be imposed upon him for one or two years &mdash;a short period at any rate&mdash;consequent upon the adoption of a protectionist policy in relation to these goods to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I am not talking now about industries not yet established here and capable of being established here, but of those industries which do exist, many of which are capable at present, if given a chance, of producing the full quantity of the goods required by the Irish people.  It only requires the reservation of the home market to enable these industries to get on their feet and, even if there is a slight dislocation in trade following the adoption of a full protectionist policy, that dislocation will soon disappear and only the benefits of the protection policy will remain.  The figures recently produced by the Department of Industry and Commerce showed clearly that one person employed in the Free State consumed a quantity of Irish agricultural produce equal to that consumed by 15 persons employed in Great Britain.  It is much more important to the Irish farmer that one additional man should be given work in the Free State than that 15 should be given work in Great Britain, and if we can so extend our industrial production as to provide work for another 82,000 men, then it is a <Col N="430" /> crime against the Irish nation if we are not doing it.</P>
    <P>I will admit that it would not be possible to effect that increase at once, no matter how drastically we applied the protective weapon, but we can set out to ensure that industrial production here would be increased by that amount at the end of a fixed period&mdash;say 10 years.  If we set about that programme with the same vigour and enthusiasm as the Russian Government is now applying to the five-years' programme in operation in that country, we would undoubtedly be able to increase our productive capacity so as to be able to provide the whole of the requirements of the home market in these particular goods at the end of the 10-year period.  In that way a permanent solution of the problem of unemployment, as we now know it, can be found.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an immediate problem.  It is of very little benefit to the unemployed worker to be told that if he sticks it out for 10 years he may get work.  The particular task is to provide work for him tomorrow&mdash;to find work for him this evening, if we can.  He is hungry and his wife and children are without food.  Unless he goes into the workhouse or breaks a shop window he is going to continue without food. The State has a duty to ensure that each of these workers who is willing to work is given an opportunity of doing so.  It cannot be argued by any responsible individual that there is a single person idle in the Free State at present because there is no work for him to do.  There is work waiting to be done&mdash;important work &mdash;and there are men waiting to do it.  But something is gone wrong with the machinery by which the energy of the men can be applied to the performance of the work.  What has gone wrong is the collapse or the absence of organisation and leadership. It is the duty of the Executive Council to provide leadership and to erect the organisation.  They have not done so; they have failed in their duty, and because they have failed. I suggest that the Dáil should reject this Estimate for the Department of <Col N="431" /> the President of the Executive Council and so express its dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>Other countries have, passed through periods of depression such as we have known.  I know that it may be argued that unemployment here is due to a variety of causes for which the Government cannot be blamed.  We have had post-war depression trotted out as an excuse for unemployment here.  We have even been told that the Irish nation is a country cursed by Providence to remain for all time depopulated and impoverished.  Do not believe it. In the United States of America within the past 12 months there was experienced a period of depression in industry as severe as any we have known here.  Did the President of the United States sit idle and talk of economic forces which he could not control?  Quite the contrary.  In a recent speech he stated that the coordinated efforts for which he was responsible among business men, public bodies and other authorities have definitely mitigated the evils of the present slump and brought recovery nearer.  He stated, the acceleration of the construction programme had resulted in contracts totalling nearly 500,000,000 dollars during the first four months of this year, or about three times the amount brought into being in the corresponding period of the great slump in 1921.  Mr. Hoover stated further his belief in the possibility and indeed the necessity of controlling these occurrences.  He did not accept the view that trade booms and trade depression were acts of God, inscrutable as well as inevitable. We have urged in the past and still urge that during any period of depression which now exists here in which a large number of our people are without work the State should embark upon schemes of work providing public utility services which are needed so as to relieve that depression and continue its work on these lines until the period of depression had passed.  In other words when trade is booming and unemployment is not serious the <Col N="432" /> State should hold its hands but when trade is depressed and unemployment is serious the State should embark directly upon construction schemes so as to provide work, increase the purchasing power of the people and thus help to bring the period of depression to an end.</P>
    <P>Take housing.  It has been estimated by the Minister for Local Government that some 40,000 houses are required in the Free State at the moment.  That is an underestimate in my opinion.  I have made a calculation myself upon the census figures, and I put it at nearer 50,000 than 40,000.  The number of houses for the construction of which the State has been responsible, or which the State has facilitated by the giving of grants, is only 17,000.  The number of skilled building workers unemployed has increased by 44 per cent. between 1926 and 1929.  The number of building trade workers at present insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts is 24,390. If the present rate of construction were doubled it would not provide all the houses we now require within ten years, and yet by doubling the present rate of construction we could provide direct employment on the construction of the houses for at least 12,000 or 15,000 additional workers.  As Deputies know, house-building means not merely employment for those engaged on the construction of the houses, but also employment for those engaged in producing the building materials required. At present building materials are not produced to any great extent in the Free State.  Yet we have the natural resources and we have everything else needed, except the market, to enable the majority of the materials required for the construction of houses to be produced here.  The market is not available. For some reasons those responsible for housing programmes do not seem anxious at all to encourage the production of building materials here.  We have repeatedly pointed out how the Killaloe slate quarry, for example, has been able to sell large quantities of its products <Col N="433" /> to the Glasgow Corporation. In fact, in a recent housing scheme, for which the Glasgow Corporation was responsible, Irish slates were definitely specified, but that same quarry has not succeeded in selling a single slate to the Dublin Corporation, which is controlled at the present time by Commissioners appointed by the Government.  If we are going to deal with the housing problem properly we have got to tackle it here from the centre.  We cannot possibly ensure the production of 40,000 or 50,000 houses if we are going to leave it in the hands of private enterprise or local government bodies.  The existence of this problem is itself a monument to the failure of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Before the Great War, when house-building was not regarded as a State matter at all, the conditions in this country were such as to earn it an unenviable reputation throughout the world, and that particularly relates to the City of Dublin.  The housing problem with which we are now faced is very largely a legacy inherited from pre-war days, except that the construction programme for which the Government are responsible is not keeping up with the growth of the demand.  As Deputies know, the number of families living in single rooms in tenement dwellings in Dublin has increased by five per cent. in the last eight years.  If we get a national housing board established, responsible for the construction of these 40,000 houses, it will be able to organise the production of building materials within the country, because it will be able to provide a guaranteed market to those carrying on that production. In that way it will be able to provide direct employment, not only to those required in building houses, but to a large number of workers throughout the country, producing cement, bricks, slates, and the other things required in house-building.</P>
    <P>And yet house-building is only one form of public work on which the Government could engage.  I grant it is the most urgent form, apart altogether from the problem of unemployment. The bad housing conditions <Col N="434" /> that exist in Dublin and a number of our towns constitute a social menace which it should be the duty of the Government to remove as rapidly as possible.  I have expressed my opinion and I adhere to it, that there can be very few cities of the same size as Dublin in Europe in which the housing conditions are as bad as they are here, 68,000 people living in dwellings described as unfit for human habitation and incapable of being made so fit.  I wish Deputies would try to bear that figure in mind, and bearing it in mind, realise the magnitude of the Government's failure, both in relation to this question of housing and the co-related question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of other avenues along which the Government might seek opportunities of directly providing work for the unemployed. I have pointed out here in the past that there are a large number of medium-sized and smaller towns in the Twenty-Six Counties which have got neither a proper water supply nor a proper sewerage scheme.  In the case of some of these towns medical opinions have been expressed that serious epidemics of sickness, due to defective water supplies, seem only to be avoided by good luck.  The absence of these works afford an opportunity to the Government of giving constructive employment at a period like the present when unemployment is particularly serious.</P>
    <P>There are other avenue that I do not wish to enumerate, such as land reclamation, afforestation, the removal and reconstruction of dangerous bridges and similar work of that kind.  Certainly there is plenty of work waiting to be done here in the Free State, sufficient to deal with the immediate problem of unemployment if the Government would only tackle it.  That immediate problem can be dealt with in that way while the steps taken for the encouragement of industrial production are being put into operation.  We could thus gradually emerge from the present period, dealing with that in the special manner I have indicated.  At <Col N="435" /> the end of our 10 years' efforts the amount of work available would be so increased that unless the population substantially increased in the meantime unemployment could not exist.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to consider this matter seriously.  We have in the past generally confined out discussions on unemployment to requests for the voting of money for relief schemes.  Money of that kind is very largely wasted though it may be necessary to spend it to relieve cases of hardship.  I want the Dáil to realise, however, that unemployment need not be here in this country of ours; we can remove it if we only can get the organisation and the leadership to direct activities along the lines I have suggested.  We have at least 50,000 people unemployed in the Free State at this moment, and that is after eight years of native Government, during which time the population of the 26 Counties actually decreased by just a quarter of a million.  During the same period over 300,000 of the very best of our race have been forced to emigrate to other countries to find livelihoods they cannot get at home.  These facts, which cannot be controverted, constitute a condemnation of the present Government which would justify this Dáil in passing the amendment to this Estimate and thus expressing its dissatisfaction.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has given us a great mass of interesting figures.  I do not propose to deal with a number of the figures he has given us, though one would like to deal with them, especially in connection with the building industry.  But there was one figure on which he will forgive me for stating he went hopelessly astray.  I think it will be within the memory of all in the House that he stated in connection with the cost of living that there was a greater reduction during the last five years in the Free State than in Great Britain.  I happen to have the figures before me for the last four years.  Let us see how far these figures are true, and we can judge <Col N="436" /> from this particular example the truth of the other statements made by the Deputy.  I find that on the 1st January, 1927, the cost of living in Great Britain was 175 over 1914. The corresponding figure in the Free State was 182, a difference of seven points in favour of Great Britain in the year 1927.  On the first of January, 1928, the figure for Great Britain was 168, and for the Free State 177, a difference of nine points. In other words, in the one year the cost of living in the Free State has gone up two points on Great Britain. Take the following year, the year 1929.  We find, again on the 1st January, the cost of living in Great Britain was 167, and in the Free State on the corresponding date it was 177, a difference of ten points as against nine points in the preceding year.  Take the year 1930.  We find, again on the 1st January, in Great Britain the cost of living figure was 166, and in the Free State 179, a difference of thirteen points.  So that instead of the Free State showing a greater reduction than Great Britain the circumstances are absolutely the opposite.  On the 1st January, 1927, the difference in favour of Great Britain was seven points.  On the 1st January, 1930, the difference in favour of Britain was thirteen points. In other words, in the four years the cost of living has gone up in the Free State by six points in comparison with Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Let us take these figures from another point of view.  We find from 1927 to 1930 a gradual decrease in the cost of living in Great Britain&mdash; 175, 168, 167, and in January of this year 166.  Let us take the corresponding figures for the Free State&mdash; 182, 177, 177, and on the 1st January of this year 179.  So that no matter what way one takes the figures one cannot but come to the conclusion that the statement made by the Deputy was hopelessly inaccurate.</P>

      <P>Might I correct the Deputy?  I do not know where the Deputy procured his figures but I was basing my argument on the index of retail prices published by &ldquo;The Economist.&rdquo;  The figures in <Col N="437" /> that paper are calculated on the prices of articles of common consumption in 110 towns in the Free State and a similar number of towns in Great Britain.  They show that the index figure in the Free State in 1925 was 188.  In 1929 it was 174. That is a drop of 14 points.  In Great Britain the figure in 1925 was 173 and in 1929 it was 163, a drop of 10 points.</P>

      <P>I do not think that they make the difference to the extent which Deputy Good thinks they do.  Speaking on the question introduced by Deputy Lemass, I desire to say that I am in favour of the motion he has down and I wish to congratulate him on the wholehearted adoption and advocacy of the plans, which have been suggested from these Benches on many occasions, for dealing in a radical way with the question of unemployment. Like him, we blame the Government for adopting a wait-and-see policy rather than taking positive action to deal with the problem that faces them in the country. I do not at all agree that any Government are justified in allowing things to go by default, as it were, in regard to the provision of employment because people who are unemployed are an economic and, in fact, a moral loss to the country as a whole.  In some form or another, <Col N="438" /> provision must be made for their upkeep and maintenance.  If they are idle they have to depend on home assistance and provision for such assistance must be found by the community as a whole.  Even though such men cannot be economically employed, it is better that they should be employed, even though not to a full economic extent, rather than have them idle.  As I say, it is not only an economic but a moral loss to have a large number of people unemployed and dependent on the efforts of other members of the community to sustain them.</P>
      <P>One of the things about which the Government deserves censure is that they have taken no active steps to deal with the problem as a national one.  They have made certain facilities available under the Trade Loans Acts and in other directions, but they have always depended and, according to recent statements, will continue to depend on private enterprise. That sacred thing known as private enterprise must not be interfered with in this country.  I wonder if we waited for private enterprise to build the Shannon scheme how long we would have been waiting if the Government had not tackled the problem in the only proper way in which it could have been tackled?  I wonder how long we would have waited for the facilities now available from Ardnacrusha if we waited for private enterprise?  I cannot conceive that the Government who did that, and who handled it as they did, would say that a question like housing, for instance, must be dealt with by private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Minister for Local Government a few days ago speaking at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and in the course of his statement he made it very clear that he was against the idea of even a municipality engaging in the work of house construction.  He was of the opinion that something in the way of a public utility society ought to take up the work of house-building. In my opinion along those lines we shall find no solution of our housing problem.  We have heard nothing of <Col N="439" /> that famous Commission which was set up two or three years ago, and under which we were to have a great number of houses provided. That has been allowed to die. Nothing has come of it.  No further action has been taken by the Government so far as we know.  The point touched on by Deputy Lemass in regard to a building programme is most important.  There ought to be a definite building programme laid down, under which provision would be made for the building of a definite number of houses each year over a period of ten years.  In that way those engaged in the building industry, whether engaged in the production of building materials or in the construction of houses, could plan beforehand and, knowing what they are up against, make due provision for extending their operations either in the production of materials, the construction of houses, or the employment of men.  The men in that event would not be obsessed, as they are at present, with the fear of continued unemployment.  They would know that a certain amount of work was available and would be available for a certain period.  That would be a tremendous advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>During the past few years a considerable amount of money has been made available by the Government but we never knew from one year to another how much will be available in the following year.  It should be the business of the Government to make their plans ahead and to look forward to a definite programme.  There is no fear that any such programme, if outlined by the present Government, would be interfered with or upset by any Government which would succeed them.  I agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass, and often made before, that there ought to be a provision whereby unemployed men would be engaged on work of public utility, especially during a period of depression in private industrial employment.  The Minister will say, and has said repeatedly, that such works do not pay, that we <Col N="440" /> cannot engage on such works unless there is value obtained.  I do not agree if he wishes to obtain full economic value because, as I have pointed out, it is better that men should be employed, even though not giving full economic value, than to be dependent on the community as a whole.  When we advocated provision of relief schemes it was for no other purpose than to afford temporary relief until permanent work could be obtained.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, evident that the development of industry will be the only permanent cure for unemployment. Here again, I think that the Government would be well advised to take more positive action in that direction than they have done. They have set up a Tariff Commission who will hear any representations put before them by industrialists who demand tariffs for their particular industries, but there is no body in this country, apparently, whose duty it is to examine into the position of industries for which a tariff might not be claimed.  There are industries in this country operating in a limited way and those engaged in them do not wish for a tariff as they themselves are all right and are making a comfortable profit.  They are able to sell the amount of goods they produce and they look at the matter entirely from the standpoint of their own personal interests.  There is no concern for the interests of the community as a whole and there is no one to examine the question as to whether these industries might not be extended considerably in the interests of the country as a whole. We believe that there should be somebody to examine a problem of that kind.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all that wholesale protection, as advocated by Deputy Lemass, would entirely meet the problem.  I think that if you are to have protection it ought to be intelligent protection.  There is no use attempting to protect or to put a tariff on an industry which you have not got.  Take the case of boots, for instance.  I think that in cases like that it is not a wise course to put on <Col N="441" /> a flat rate tariff on boots of every kind and description, no matter whether the country is producing that kind of boot or not.  We know that factories here are able to produce a certain class, or two or three classes, of boots and shoes and produce them at cheap rates, whereas there are other classes of boots and shoes which I doubt if they could produce at all.  I refer to childern's and certain classes of ladies' boots and shoes.  There is a 15 per cent. customs duty on all classes of boots and shoes.  I think that a much better plan would be to decide what classes of boots or shoes could be made most efficiently in the country and then to give the fullest measure of protection to them, even to prohibiting the importation of those classes of boots or shoes, whereas the tariff on the boot or shoe that cannot be economically manufactured in this country should be removed altogether. I think that a flat wholesale protection policy is not sufficient to meet the problem.  Any protection of that kind ought to be applied intelligently and with a view to extending a particular industry, or branch of an industry, which we have here already.  Much the same might be done in the case of woollen materials.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this matter, more than in any other, there has been a failure on the part of the present Government to understand and appreciate the problem.  The Government has failed to do all that a Government should do in the matter. It is not sufficient to make certain facilities available and then to fold your arms and wait until certain things happen.  It is no excuse, as has been advanced on more than one occasion here, that a similar problem exists in other countries.  That does not concern us.  What concerns us is the problem that exists in our own country.  As Deputy Lemass has argued, and as has been argued more than once here, the problem does not present the same difficulty in this country that it does in highly industrialised countries, like Great Britain, which find their outside markets cut off.  I have little hope that <Col N="442" /> anything we say here will encourage the present Government to change the attitude which it has consistently adopted in this matter during practically its entire lifetime.  The unemployment problem is one that requires to be tackled in a national way.  The community as a whole is suffering, and will continue to suffer, while this problem is allowed to exist &mdash;for the unemployed man is a danger to himself and a danger to the community as well as being an economic loss to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel called upon to say a few words on this Estimate, having regard to the statement made by Deputy O'Connell in the course of his speech.  That statement has been made on a number of occasions in this House.  I passed it over on those occasions because I hoped, at the time, that some good would come from the conference to which Deputy O'Connell referred.  Deputy O'Connell said a few moments ago: &ldquo;We have heard nothing of that famous Commission of two or three years ago; it has been allowed to die.&rdquo;  The inference, of course, is that the Government is to blame because nothing came of that conference. Having regard to the fact that I acted on that conference, and on a previous conference, I felt that I was under a certain obligation to keep silence regarding its deliberations, even when imputations were made against me personally.  But when this statement is repeated on the eye of a bye-election, I can only assume that it is repeated for political purposes.  I must also assume &mdash;because I would not care to suggest that Deputy O'Connell would wilfully make an inaccurate statement of that kind&mdash;that the Deputy is not really in touch with the Labour Party.  Deputy O'Connell knows perfectly well the genesis of that conference.  But I am afraid he does not know very much of what happened at it, even though he is leader of the Labour Party.  May I tell the House, as briefly as I can, what happened there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know, an Unemployment Committee was set up in 1927. That Committee reported and dealt <Col N="443" /> particularly with the housing problem.  The report was unanimous. Two distinguished members of the Labour Party&mdash;I do not mean Deputies&mdash;were members of that Committee&mdash;Mr. O'Brien and Senator Duffy.  As regards those two representatives of Labour.  I am perfectly satisfied that they acted with absolute sincerity and conviction and that they believed that they were right in the estimate they were putting forward as to what would happen when certain proposals were made to those engaged in the building trade.  Dealing with this question of housing, the report, which these two representatives of Labour signed, stated:</P>
    <P>If the problem is to be solved in the present generation, this can only be done by (a) a drastic reduction of building costs; and (b) the provision of housing loans for local authorities....  We have already adverted to the recognition of the moral duty of the taxpayer and the ratepayer of bearing their share of the burden.  There is an equal moral duty and an equal responsibility to the nation on the part of those engaged in the building trade to make their contribution to the provision of houses for the poor.  The employers can make their contribution to this project of national welfare by cutting the costs at their end of building houses for the poor to the lowest figure which will suffice to enable them to carry on their industry. In the long view, they will serve their own interests best by enabling the State to initiate and carry through a continuous programme, giving them the advantages of being able to buy ahead and of having the services of contented workers.</P>
    <P>Having regard to Deputy O'Connell's statement I ask the attention of Deputies to the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The output of the building operatives has hitherto been restricted by the very natural and human fear of unemployment, resulting from the spasmodic and <Col N="444" /> uncertain employment in their industry. It is asking too much from human nature if we expect men to give the best output they are capable of, when they know that by doing so they are hastening the day when they will themselves be relegated to the ranks of the unemployed.  We feel assured that if this fear were removed from the minds of the building operatives by a guaranteed programme of work, spread over a sufficient period (say, ten years), their civic spirit would respond to the national call and to the need of the houseless poor.  We feel assured that by such a reduction of builders' costs, and a substantially increased output from the building operatives under such conditions of continuity, a solution of the housing problem to the lasting benefit of the nation can be worked out in our day.</P>
    <P>That report was signed by the two representatives deputed by Labour to attend that Conference.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but I am perfectly satisfied as to their complete sincerity and their belief that that report would be carried out.  A Conference was summoned on the head of that.  I must assume that Deputy O'Connell is not aware of what happened at that Conference.  The break-down at that Conference has been used again and again as a ground for sneering at the Government's policy and for the purpose of showing that the Government had not done what it should have done.  The reason of the break-down was that the building operatives refused to make the slightest concession on the terms of that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is relevant from this point of view: This is a debate on the Vote for the President's Department; a charge has been made against the Government by Deputy O'Connell as to things that are not being done when he is aware, or should be aware, of the reasons why these things are not being done.  Deputy Cooney has interrupted to know what was the nature of the concessions that were asked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Cooney had listened to the paragraphs of the Report which I read he would have understood what the concessions were and he would not have indulged in that interruption.  These charges should not be made in this House or elsewhere by persons who, if not aware of the facts, should be aware of them.  The builders' side in that conference offered to produce the books of a number of firms &mdash;any firms selected by the building operatives&mdash;and have these books examined by auditors appointed by the Labour representatives, and then consider what concession could be made by them on the basis of those figures.  The building operatives, on their side, refused to make the slightest concession.  For that reason the conference was adjourned and has not been reassembled; no proposition <Col N="446" /> has since been put forward which would give any hope of a solution being reached if the conference were reassembled.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in the course of his observations on this question in the House, suggested that twelve or fifteen thousand workers could be absorbed in the building trade. It is perfectly obvious that Deputy Lemass has given no consideration or study to this matter.  If he had he would be aware that no arrangement is possible whereby the absorption could take place of any such number of workers in the building trade.  The difficulty would be met at once that 90 per cent of the people seeking employment are unskilled.  You cannot have adulteration of labour, and you cannot get the necessary number of skilled men to absorb the number of unskilled workers which the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is not the first time I have stated the facts in this House as I knew them and as I know them.  The fact remains that, for whatever reason, the Government has not acted on this Report of the Conference.  It has taken no action on the recommendations that were made to it in regard to the provision of houses.  As to the breakdown of this Conference, I stated in this House before, and it has not been contradicted, that the position was that a certain demand was made from the two sides to this Conference&mdash;the builders, on the one side, and the building operatives, on the other side.  I agree with the recommendation of the Committee and the members of the Committee themselves admitted that the action of the operatives hitherto was due to the uncertainty that attached to their occupation.  I think the way to remove those difficulties would be to give them certainly of employment. We hear that the offer of the employers was to open their books for inspection.  They did not suggest that there was any possibility&mdash;in fact they suggested the opposite&mdash;of reducing building costs.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is the complaint of the Labour Party, that although the memorandum was submitted there was no official meeting of the conference.  The Labour Party took it that the conference was adjourned to see what offers they would get towards carrying out the intentions of the report of the conference. A constructive programme in black and white was put before the chairman, and the chairman now publicly admits here that he took it upon himself to say: &ldquo;This is not worth considering and therefore I will not call the conference together, even for the opportunity of considering the memorandum.&rdquo;  Now that is <Col N="449" /> certainly where I think the chairman of the conference is open to blame.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell that Deputy Rice, in spite of his position as the official apologist for the Government in their inactivity in the matter of providing employment, has not given an explanation which would satisfy any person who is intelligent enough to believe that the labourers of Dublin have as much interest in the settlement of this question as the builders. According to Deputy Rice, the builders opened their books but no co-operation was forthcoming from the operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that a considerable number of the building operatives in Dublin are unemployed. I know also that some of them&mdash;I do not know whether all or not&mdash;have taken a considerable interest in this matter, and if Deputy <Col N="450" /> Rice, instead of wasting our time here apologising for having anything to do with this Unemployment Commission which never resulted in anything, had turned his attention seriously, as the House and the people who elected him in North Dublin thought he was going to do, to try and bring the different interests involved in this dispute together; we might listen to him, but time after time he, like the Minister for Local Government, in his closing remarks on the Estimate for local government recently, has told the Opposition parties &ldquo;You are shirking the question of building costs.&rdquo; We are not.  We are prepared, and I hope the Labour Party are prepared, to discuss this matter in a common-sense manner and in regard to the circumstances, but it is quite wrong and it shows utter futility and an utter negation of Government policy that at this hour of the day all they can do is blame the building operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any Government can be justified no matter what the excuse may be.  I do not agree that the building operatives are as black as Deputy Rice wants to make them out.  I believe there are common-sense men amongst them who have studied this question of building costs and probably quite sincerely prepared this memorandum.  If Deputy Rice had the interest of the unemployed at heart he should have taken advantage of any circumstances to get these rival interests together until something would be hammered out.  He stresses one point, the question of building costs. He says nothing whatever about the question of loans.  It has been proved over and over again that, whether you effect economics in building costs or not under the present facilities the Government are able to give, the rent that will be fixed on these dwellings will be such that it will be absolutely impossible for the tenant to pay, and until a serious effort is made to provide credit facilities and to enable local authorities to bring the rental within some relation to the income of the ordinary labourer or ordinary artisan <Col N="451" /> it will be quite impossible to go ahead.  In my opinion both matters must be taken up.</P>
    <P>The whole question of building I think is one which would come aptly under the functions of the economic or development commission which we have several times urged from this side of the House should be set up.  Here you have a question where people who are not acquainted with the technicalities of the industry would find it absolutely impossible to reach a solution. You must have engineers, architects and men who will not be satisfied with looking at the books of the builders which show that they are not deriving a profit.  You must have men with initiative and organising power to whom, I hope, the Government would say, &ldquo;We give you authority to go ahead with a five years, ten years or three years' programme provided you can show some result and get these different interests to co-operate.&rdquo;  If the matter were dealt with in that way and independent technical experts were brought in as well as the Government representatives I feel that some benefits would have accrued and some results would have appeared.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell quarrelled with Deputy Lemass because it seemed to Deputy O'Connell that it has been suggested from this side of the House that we want to protect industries we have not got.  We want to provide industries we have not got.  Millions were expended in the hydroelectric or Shannon scheme which we were told was to provide power. We want to see industries started which will absorb that power.  We want to see them going on with a system of technical education.  We realise we cannot have workshop practice or that familiarity with modern industrial technique unless an attempt is made to set up industries, for example, in connection with engineering and the motor business. Unless we have these industries here it would be impossible to give our operatives the training they require. He also said that he wants to know <Col N="452" /> whether Fianna Fáil stands for a policy of producing and protecting commodities which perhaps cannot be economically manufactured in this country.  What does he mean by economically?  Does he mean the same as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who praises up the efficiency of the port mills in Birkenhead? Does he want the efficiency of Deputy Good?  Is he deceived by these figures Deputy Good read out and which have no bearing directly on the situation in this country with reference to the difference in the cost of living between Great Britain and here?  Deputy Good may not be aware that 60 per cent. of the ordinary worker's income or perhaps the ordinary citizen's income in England is spent on food.  Furthermore, Deputy Good has not shown us that the calculations which go to make up this index are not the same as in this country.  It is not necessarily the same commodities that are selected. Furthermore, everyone knows that distribution in this country is more wasteful and expensive than in England. Whether we have protection or not or the whole hog free trade Deputy Good wants or not, we would not buy our tomatoes a penny cheaper in Dublin.  We would not buy the food imported into this country cheaper.  All these things are coming in through a wasteful system of distribution.  There are a great many other factors which make it absolutely impossible to make a comparison between the two figures.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Good says that the tendency of protecting small industries in this country, which are necessarily limited in their output, has caused an increase in the cost of living, well and good.  We admit that may happen.  We have no proof it has happened.  Although Ministers have gone out of their way to say that protection has effected an increase in the cost of living they have not proved that, and until it is proved, while the tendency may be there, we are simply beating the air when we say that protection has caused a change in the cost of living. Deputy Good and those associated with him will have to show us that <Col N="453" /> those extra points which denote a higher cost of living in the Free State than in Great Britain are directly attributable to the protection accorded to industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will give us something definite on the point as you are taking it up.  We say in order to tackle this question in a national manner a development commission should be set up.  The Minister for Finance to-day in defending the Tariff Commission said that it would be impossible to have two Commissions working.  The Tariff Commission simply examines applications for tariffs.  It never examines how the industries are proceeding, how exactly their working and costings are going ahead.  It never seems to go back upon its work and readjust it.  It is doing that to a certain extent now, but in the question of boots and shoes referred to, it has not gone back on the tariff and examined whether the tariff was sufficient or insufficient, whether there was in fact a change in the cost of living or not.  We have said, and still contend, that if the terms of reference of the Tariff Commission are extended to include that, it will be welcomed on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> We want to have the full facts placed before us.  We do not want to have the protection programme prejudiced in the way it has been by loose statements from not proceed with protection because it would mean an increase in the cost of living.  There might be a tendency for that to happen in the beginning, but it is no satisfaction to the idle workers in the towns, it is no satisfaction, as I said in the debate on the flour motion, to the operatives who are thrown out of employment in the different inland mills throughout the country, to say that a tariff on flour would increase the cost, and the same holds true of the other commodities with which protection under a progressive policy should deal.  All these other articles which are at present being imported are a dead loss to the country and are creating an adverse trade balance. No doubt they provide employment for a number of distributors and importers, but they are of no advantage to the ordinary worker who cannot find work on the land, who is being driven into the town, and who is existing there on home assistance, and it is no advantage to the ratepayer who is maintaining him to say that it would affect the cost of living to give that man employment.  It might increase the cost of living in the beginning, but if a start were made in the proper manner, if the necessary technical advice were called in to try to develop our industries to produce the things we are at present importing, I have no doubt but that all sections of the population would rise to the occasion, and that if the manufacturers saw a secure policy in front of them which meant the building up and the consolidation of industry, they would lend a hand, and that the labourers, if they saw a continuity of employment before them, steady employment and some security of living in the country, would give better value, would give the best that is in them, as they have to give in other countries when they leave this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has referred to <Col N="455" /> the number of articles which are being unnecessarily imported.  At the risk of wearying the House.  I will again go through that list. Wheat and flour, £5,500,000; corn offals, £450,000&mdash;that is nearly £6,000,000 between wheat, flour and offals&mdash;apparel, £4,315,000; boots and shoes, £1,746,000; woollens, £1,557,000; paper, etc., £1,161,000; motor bodies, £816,000; fertilisers, £760,000; bread and buns, £225,000; furniture, £119,000, and slates, £83,000.  Does any Deputy suggest that with reasonable organisation and reasonable efficiency all these commodities which are being imported to the tune of millions of pounds every year could not be dispensed with?  Does anybody seriously suggest that producing these commodities in this country and giving employment here would not tend to remedy the present emigration, would not tend to better conditions generally?  Is the policy simply to be that this country is to go on as a grass ranch until it ultimately declines to a couple of million people, or is the policy of the Government to be to try to preserve the population here?  If it is the latter it would be much better for them to tackle this question in a big national manner and to get the co-operation of all parties than to deal with it in a piecemeal fashion, as they have been doing up to the present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was the first to scoff at this idea of a development Commission. What has happened?  A Tariff Commission has been set up to deal with the question of tariffs, a Grain Tribunal had to be set up, a Gaeltacht Commission had to be set up, a Ports and Harbours Tribunal had to be set up, and a Fisheries Committee had to be set up. In each industry for which Commissions were set up you will find that as the question looms large and as the demand of the industry for assistance comes before this House, you will have to take steps to reorganise it, that ultimately you will <Col N="456" /> have to provide assistance in one way or another, either financial assistance or technical assistance.</P>
    <P>In any case you will have to take steps to build up these industries. What is the objection, therefore, to the setting up of a Commission which would survey the whole field, which would examine existing industries carefully and find out what their potentialities were, which would find out whether their output could be increased, find out whether branches of them could be founded in some other towns that are at present rotting into decay, and side by side with that, examine the possibilities of new industries and take up the question of our mineral resources, which was taken up by the old Dáil but which has not been touched since?  Then there was the fisheries scheme, which we talk about so much and for which we are waiting so long and so patiently.  In 1921 the old Dáil Commission proposed that a Commission should be set up to develop the fishing industry in almost the same way as is now being suggested.  But nine years have been lost, and the cause of that loss was that there was no body to carry on the work in the meantime; there has been no body working constantly at this problem, and till the Government have some body on which to shift responsibilities&mdash;not the building operatives, not the Labour people, but some body like the Tariff Commission&mdash;they will have these constant discussions on unemployment coming up here.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been frequently brought before the attention of the Government is the question of sewerage and water supplies in small towns.  That is very important. In connection with the relief schemes that have been given in the work of the Land Commission and in the work of drainage the Government made a claim that it has done a certain amount to provide employment rurally, and that it has also done a certain amount on the roads. But there is an urgent demand for work in the small towns, and even in some of the big towns, but the <Col N="457" /> Commission for which Deputy Rice had some responsibility simply left that question in the air, a question that will have to be tackled some time, and it is better that it should be tackled when it can do the maximum amount of good than that it should be done later.  That Commission left the whole question in the air by piously suggesting that the Government should take steps to show to the local authorities the advantages that these schemes would mean to them and the necessity for having them.</P>
    <P>There is a crux in this matter.  I have three fairly important small towns in my own constituency&mdash;Tullow, Bagenalstown and Callan&mdash; where there is unemployment and where the sanitary conditions are extremely primitive.  In two of these towns there are town commissioners but in the third there are none.  It is absolutely impossible for the town commissioners to raise the necessary finances to do what is required. There is no use asking the county board of health to do it; the farming community believe that they have enough burdens already in the upkeep of the roads and so on.  The Government will simply have to deal with this matter, and I think they ought to make a big national effort to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The question of the roads is another matter.  Perhaps too much attention has been given to the construction of main and trunk roads for tourists.  The farmers are paying £1,114,000 this year in rates for the upkeep of the roads, according to the Minister, much of which is being spent on the upkeep of roads that are actually of benefit to a very small percentage of farmers, if any.  The Government ought to change that policy.  They ought to give some inducement to the local bodies to enable them to proceed with road making that would be of utility to the people of the countryside and that are really necessary.</P>
    <P>In the case of drainage, the present policy of the Government, of which everybody has so much hope, has been almost a complete failure. <Col N="458" /> Out of 500 schemes prepared only about half, I think, have been fully examined.  The Parliamentary Secretary informed us recently that the most he could expect under the Act would be fifty schemes, costing about £100,000, but now at the end of the five or six years during which the Act has been in operation we find that only eighteen schemes out of the 500 which had been suggested have been begun.  The difficulties are there and they are tremendous difficulties, but we must hope to meet them if we really want to get the work done.  We should try to provide employment and at the same time to give work which we believe will be useful.  What I submit is that we have a right to expect more from the Board of Works than eighteen schemes after five or six years.</P>
    <P>In the case of agriculture the Ministerial policy is well known.  The policy is to concentrate upon the production of articles over the ultimate price of which it is admitted we have no control.  It is said that we have some control at least over our own home markets, and that small as that is it is of importance.  If we could produce at home the £360,000 worth of butter which we are importing, it would at least relieve the situation to some extent in the present oppressed position of the butter industry.  The same applies to oats, barley and barley products, and maize products.  Bacon and hams alone come to £1,627,000 annually, and whether or not the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues believe that it would be good policy to prevent these agricultural products coming into this country, they ought at least to take some steps to discourage them.  It was suggested at one time that they would at least compel the branding of Chinese bacon, so that when the Irish people were eating it they would at least know that it was not a home product, but even that has not been done; even the step of compelling foreign merchandise to be marked has not been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> If we are going to solve the problem of unemployment we are not going to do it solely by protecting and building up industries.  There is a limit to our industrial capacity and to our resources.  But we have land, the most fertile land in Europe, land which is as fertile as the land in England or any other country.  There is no reason why that land should not be made to maintain a much larger population than it does at present.  There is no reason why that land should not produce more food, why there should not be more intensive work put into it, and in that way, perhaps the best way of all, reduce food prices, and thereby bring about an easing of the circle which would ultimately reduce the cost of production.</P>
    <P>The Ministerial policy is that the country must remain a cattle ranch. There is not a word about the people in the congested areas who think that better land should be given to them, about the landless people who must get land to live upon if they cannot get work in the towns, about those farmers who complain that they cannot make ends meet, or about the tillage farmers, who ought to be the backbone of the country; let them go into the bankruptcy court, let their farms become derelict, let their children leave the country, but do not interfere with the policy of free trade.  So long as the free trade policy, which was ruthlessly forced upon us without our people having any opportunity of fighting it, continues to hold sway, so long as men who talk about Griffith and Griffith's policy continue that policy of free trade, then unemployment will continue. If they at least take steps to inquire into these matters; if they realise that there is another point of view as well as the point of view of free imports; that there is a point of view as well as that of the cost of living of the unemployed labour; if they take into consideration the common-sense factor that whether the loaf of bread is a farthing more <Col N="460" /> or less does not matter to any man who has no loaf, then we may expect some policy from the Government in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect dealt with by the Opposition is the question of protection.  I stand as strongly for protection as any member of the House, but when I am told that protection is going to solve all the economic ills of the country I have to rebut such an absurd statement, If one glances at the effects of protection in Australia and compares the economic condition of Australia with the economic condition of this country, what does one find?  Which of the two countries is the more prosperous?  The national debt of Australia to-day is £1,095,000,000, and the national debt of the Irish Free State is £20,000,000.  The Irish Free State can borrow money at 4½ per cent.; the Commonwealth of Australia can scarcely borrow money at all.  In Australia everything is protected.  Even labour is protected, and what has been the result?  Has it benefited the country? The financial condition of Australia is an ample reply to that. The condition of Australia financially can only be described as deplorable. <Col N="463" /> If one reads the papers intelligently one can see that in Australia they are now in the position of rationing the imports.  Perhaps I should say not rationing the imports, but the actual necessities of the country.  Tobacco is rationed and whiskey is rationed.  I can see that in the present year in Australia there will be the same panic looking for a package of cigarettes as there was here during the Great War.  And protection is to be the sovereign remedy for all our economic ills!</P>
      <P>The only man I heard dealing with the subject in anything like a reasonable way was Deputy Derrig. Deputy Derrig rightly said that protection is only one means for the building up of a country.  If we were to proceed upon the protective lines advocated by the Opposition there could be only one end to it and that is the end that has been brought about in Australia&mdash;practically bankrupt.  Let us analyse the position closely.  If all the prosperity springs, as we are told it does, from protection, how is it that 18/- of our money can buy an Australian sovereign?  The Opposition emphasises the importance of protection, but how can that particular thing be explained?  I was down at Kilbeggan on Sunday and I heard Deputy Lemass delivering a speech on protection.  I asked him to explain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy must deal with Deputy Lemass's speech here to-day.  Kilbeggan is out of bounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If protection brings the prosperity that we are told by the Opposition it does bring, can they explain how it is, with this much despised State of ours, that 18/- of our currency is worth 20/- of Australian currency?  It must be remembered that there is no more highly protected country, if I may except the United States, than Australia.  The farmers of the country have something to say about the cost of living.  A statement was made here to the effect that the imposition of a tariff on boots did not <Col N="464" /> increase the price of boots.  If you had half-a-dozen children to buy boots for you would know very quickly whether or not boots are increased in price.  Anyone who has to buy boots for a family knows that the price has gone up by 10 to 20 per cent.  Ordinary boots are at least 2/6 to 5/- a pair dearer, and there is no gainsaying that.  The woman who runs the house will tell you, and we need not go into economics to find that out, because it is a matter of common sense.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the question is the wonderful part that Labour is going to play in the new housing programme that the Opposition intend to set up.  I am sorry there is only one Labour member present, because I was anxious to ask Labour Deputies to explain why it is that when labourers are receiving over 300 per cent. of an increase in wages they are giving a lower output to-day than in pre-war days.  I happen to have some knowledge of the matter about which I am speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have knowledge of the conditions amongst labourers for many years.  I remember the time when a skilled labouring man was paid from 8d. to 10d., whereas now he is receiving from 1/10½ to 2/2.  That represents 300 per cent. more money, while the index figure of the cost of living is only 100 per cent. above pre-war. The labouring men want to get things at pre-war, but when they are asked to pull their weight in the building of houses for the country their reply is the impossible scheme referred to by Deputy Rice.  If the workers would only give an increased output I would not ask to have a single penny taken off their wages, because I realise that lowpaid labourers are one of the worst calamities that any country could have.  I know that no section of the community spends its money more freely than the labouring section. The least they should do, in view of the wages they are getting, is to pull their weight.  As far as the building of houses is concerned, the labourers are not pulling their weight.  If one looks at the papers one can see that there is a strike threatened in Cork <Col N="465" /> for an increase of wages notwithstanding that they are already getting 300 per cent. over pre-war and the prices of commodities are only 100 per cent. over pre-war.  I have known men to get 2/2½ per hour, and when they are asked a price scarcely 100 per cent. over pre-war for an article they walk out rather than pay it.  That is Labour for you!  If this scheme that Labour has set forth of a ten years' programme with cooperative buying is put into operation the least that might be expected is that the labourers themselves should pull their weight.  It appears to be the Opposition Party's scheme as well.  I would like to ask the Front Bench of the Opposition if they ever got a job done by time and material?</P>

      <P>If you got it done once you would not get it done a second time.  These are the facts that the Opposition are closing their eyes to. This country is steadily progressing. We are told that the tillage of the country is declining.  If anybody looks at the figures for the last three years the position will be made quite clear.  The statement about a decline was made freely in this election.  One can see from the figures that far from there being a decline in tillage there is a steady increase.  Take the trade returns for the country during the last three or four years. Speaking from memory, in 1926 the amount was £103,000,000; in 1927 £105,000,000, and in 1928 £107,000,000.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt I would have a more attentive audience listening to my speech than would the Deputy.  Let us get down to the bedrock of common sense.  The country at the present moment is steadily progressing and the rate of <Col N="466" /> progress would be considerably accelerated but for the political uncertainly existing.  Does any man here think that any capitalist is going to put money into Irish industries in view of the statements made by the second biggest Party in the State?  Would any sane man invest money in an industry&mdash;anybody who knows anything&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Ford was brought back to this country by the genius of one man who sits on that Bench there.  If it was not for the genius of that man Henry Ford would have left the country bag and baggage. The Opposition knows that but they will not own up to the truth.  And Henry Ford has no protection.  This industry with its huge output has no protection.  It is able to send its products to all parts of the world without protection.  Protection is an important factor in the programme of Fianna Fáil.  If we want Irish industry to stand upon its feet we want Labour to pull its weight, we want the Opposition to pull their weight and we want those sitting on this side of the House to pull their weight.  Only those who are standing behind President Cosgrave are endeavouring to do something to build up this State.  Let us take the case of the beet sugar industry.  What was the criticism upon it from these benches?  We were told that it was a waste of three millions of the Irish rate-payers' money.  Yet there is no industry in which protection plays a greater part than it does in the Irish beet sugar industry.  The Shannon scheme was organised to give cheap power to manufacturers to enable them to compete with foreign rivals.  The money could not be spent in a better way; but no matter what the Government does there is no word of appreciation from those who prate about Irish industry but never do anything to bring it about.  If the different parties in this State would only pull together quite a lot could be done.  We would have the Labour Party reducing the <Col N="467" /> cost of labour and giving a reasonable output.  We might have the Opposition doing its bit and putting an end to political uncertainty. Then we would have the Party on this side of the House that has all along been doing its bit to pull the country out of the rut.  If all Parties did their share, this country of ours would be as prosperous as any other country in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>Deputy O'Connell, replying to Deputy Rice, stated that the Labour representatives at the Housing Conference asked for certain particulars, and Deputy Rice's explanation was that he did not think it worth spending a twopenny stamp to summon the other members of the Conference to consider the question.  We have heard a lot about housing.  We in Wicklow have been endeavouring to do our part in providing houses, and the chief opposition we have received is from the Local Government Department. On the 11th April last the Wicklow Urban Council sent plans to the Local Government Department, and up to the present no word has been received from the Department by way of approval or otherwise. The treatment accorded to the Board of Health in connection with the Greystones houses is known to the public.  The Wicklow Board of Health is spending £16,000 per year on home assistance, and seventy per cent. of that goes to the relief of unemployed persons at an average rate of 5s. per week for a man and his family.  The County Council has provided in the rates for the relief of unemployment by road work.  In connection with road work a regulation of the Government has been in operation for some years that ex-National Army men must get preference. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that regulation, because I hold that if a man is unemployed and able to work he should get work, no matter what army he has been in. Under that regulation, as at present worked, if twenty men are to be employed, about seventeen married ex-National Army men and <Col N="468" /> three single men are employed.  The result is that the ex-National Army men get all the work on the national roads.  If that is to be continued, there will be no alternative but for the county council to withdraw their officials from the work, because the county rates contribute 60 per cent. of the amount spent on road work. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that regulation, because it is going to lead to endless trouble.  In our county we want every man who is unemployed to get work.  When it was not popular we always gave work to ex-National Army men.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Deputies that the Government should come to the assistance of public bodies. Sewerage and waterworks schemes are required in the rural areas, and public bodies are faced with the position that they are unable to provide proper sanitation and water schemes unless they receive assistance from the State. Labour Deputies have never tried to decry the credit of the State, and the credit of the State now being so high there is nothing to prevent the Executive Council from assisting and encouraging public bodies that are desirous of doing work of public utility, as well as relieving the rates, by reducing the number in receipt of home assistance.  Deputy Byrne has stated that there are more unemployed in Liverpool than in the whole of the Free State and that there are more people registered in the North of Ireland as unemployed than in the Free State.  The reply to that is that there is no use registering in the Free State when you have exhausted your benefit, because you get nothing for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the men are to get the information that they got in the Exchange I mentioned, there is no use in their wasting their time registering. The men go to the home assistance officers looking for home assistance, and if you want a proper return of those unemployed at present it can be got from the home assistance officers.  Deputy Byrne stated that the workers in Dublin are in receipt of wages which are 300 per cent. higher than they were pre-war. Those who are employed may be in receipt of these wages, but there are thousands of men willing to work at the recognised rate of wages and not at 300 per cent. over pre-war who are unable to get work.  The wages allowed to be paid by the Government in the various areas for road work, drainage, and work of public utility is from 27/- to 30/- per week. That is not 300 per cent. over pre-war.</P>
      <P>There is a large amount of tillage done in my constituency, and if the policy of the Minister for Agriculture is to continue we shall have even a larger number unemployed after the next harvest.  A small farmer in Wicklow has not a lot of stock to feed, and he does not agree with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  The merchants there who buy the oats from the farmers have over three thousand barrels of oats in stock for which they are unable to get a market owing to the German oats coming into the country.  The result is that they have notified the farmers that they will require no oats next season. That will mean that the farmers will have to dispense with the labourers they employ.  The small farmer wants to sell his oats to the merchant so that he may be able to pay off the bank and pay his rates and annuity.  The prospect is, therefore, a very gloomy one for the people in my constituency if the Minister for Agriculture continues the policy which he announced last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Executive Council to give some assistance to <Col N="470" /> public bodies who are prepared to do work of public utility.  There is no use in having county medical officers and looking after people suffering from tuberculosis if the houses which are condemned by the county medical officers cannot be replaced by others.  The boards of health appealed to the Government to give them long-term loans and a subsidy to enable them to provide houses for agricultural labourers.  The Minister for Local Government pointed out that agricultural labourers should pay something like 5/- per week for a house, which would be impossible out of the small wages they receive; therefore; the Minister refused to extend the long-term loans to the boards of health.  In Nenagh the boards of health have secured far better terms from an English insurance company than they would get under the Local Loans Fund.  They have secured a loan repayable in 60 years.  If something like that could be given to boards of health and urban councils it would go a long way towards solving unemployment and the housing problem in the rural areas.  Public boards are receiving deputations from the unemployed at meeting after meeting appealing for work, and resolution have been passed and sent to the Government, but without any result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that the Government were solving the unemployment problem.  While we give credit to the Government for certain things they have done, we say that they have not given the attention that is necessary to this matter, and that it is the duty of the Government to solve this problem.  When the Unemployment Committee met it was confined to city men, and representation was not given to the rural areas. When that Committee failed to agree the whole thing was finished as far as the rest of the country was concerned.  In the rural areas we have not the high wages that are paid in the city, and even though the conference on the housing question failed in Dublin I am quite certain that if a conference was called representative of employers and employees <Col N="471" /> and others concerned in the housing problem in the rural areas an agreement would be arrived at which would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the Executive Council to remove the regulation which I have referred to, that ex-National Army men must get preference in road work and other work. If it is insisted upon the work will be held up, because the county councils, who are paying 60 per cent. of the money, are not going to be parties to putting one set of men against another, and to seeing certain men getting employment while others are allowed to go hungry.  I support the amendment to refer the Estimate back pending a decision by the Executive Council to do something for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that the Government fully recognise that they are more or less on trial on a very serious charge, in view of the fact that they have put up two such eminent members of the legal profession to defend them on this Estimate. Deputy Rice and Deputy Byrne were the only two apologists so far for the Government inactivity in connection with unemployment with the exception of course, of the Minister's brilliant contribution when he interjected the term &ldquo;shut up.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion on this Estimate resolves itself into a question as to whether or not this Government has used the powers which it has in its possession to the fullest extent to do something really effective in connection with unemployment.  I fully realise that there are world forces at the root of this unemployment question, the twin forces of machinery and finance, and I admit that it is problem which cannot be settled overnight.  But the tinkering that has gone on, while it provides material for platform apologies for the Ministers and their supine Press, is certainly worse than useless. We had Deputy Rice's famous committee on housing, and as we said <Col N="472" /> at the time&mdash;at least I said it, and I repeat it now&mdash;that committee was set up for no other purpose than mere eyewash.  It is a well-known fact that the unemployment statistics with which the Government dope the country are by no means accurate. Members of the Government go about the country talking about the revival which their tinkering petty protection has brought about, when they know quite well that this revival has not led to any real relief of the terrible sufferings which thousands of our people are undergoing. While Deputy Byrne talks in terms of comparison between this and other countries, and proceeds to defend the Government in such an eloquent fashion, and quotes statistics, there is, after all, only one real question to be dealt with.  Have the Government used their powers to the fullest in order to deal with this problem of unemployment?  Are they prepared now to admit that they have not used those powers? If they come to this House and say: We are unable to find a solution, we can appreciate, at any rate, that they are honest.  But we are convinced long ago that the lines upon which they are going cannot possibly lead to a solution, and I personally am convinced that there is no genuine desire on the part of the Ministry to solve this problem.  We have had ample evidence of their callous attitude towards the unemployed during the last eight years. The farmer is getting poor prices for his produce, and the citizens in the towns and cities are compelled to pay exorbitant prices for their produce. It is here exactly at this point that Government intervention is required, to ensure that the producer is guaranteed a fair price for his produce and that that produce will reach the consumer at a price which he is able to pay.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister can he tell this House why he has failed up to the present to deal with this problem. Has he not the necessary machinery to organise a system to regulate the cost of production&mdash;the cost to the producer and the cost to the consumer?  This Tariff Commission, <Col N="473" /> with one eye on its masters' divergent views and the other timidly on the capitalist Press, whose interests are not the welfare of the people, I have no hesitation in saying, as at present constituted, must be scrapped if we are to make any progress, and must be succeeded by a body of independent experts who will have the real interests of the people at heart.  Call them what you will&mdash;an economic council&mdash;but above all secure the type of person who will go into that council determined to do his best in order to save this country from the ruin which it is steadily heading for if something is not done, and set it down as a first principle that they shall direct all their efforts to see that articles that can be produced here at home will not be allowed to be imported.  It is not beyond the powers of human intelligence and organisation to do that.  It is, to my mind, a very simple and obvious remedy, and yet, during the past eight years, with increasing unemployment, increasing hunger, increasing emigration, and all the other evils attendant on those, we have had nothing but apologies, no genuine explanations.  We have had reams of figures dished up to us year after year by Ministers, but, as I say, the real cardinal fact still stares everybody in the face who wants to see it.  Hunger and poverty exist, and we have our delegations touring the Continent, our legations abroad beautifully furnished, our plenipotentiaries well salaried, well clothed, and well fed, and we are told that our national credit is the highest in the world.  Of what use is our high national credit if we cannot deal with this vital problem? Between the Census of 1911 and that of 1926 Ireland lost by emigration 512,600 of its people.  Since the Census of 1926, to countries outside Europe alone, a further 125,000 have emigrated.  In eighteen years, therefore, 637,000 persons, 85 more than the population of the whole province of Connacht, in the prime of life and in the maximum of their productive power, have had to leave the Twenty-six Counties in order to seek a livelihood abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> I could follow on the same lines as the Government's apologists by quoting statistics to show that even the limited protection that has been given proves conclusively that if further protection was immediately applied we would head in the direction of finding a remedy for this evil. Let us take the boot and shoe industry, for instance.  There was a tariff duty of 15 per cent. put on boots and shoes in 1926.  The duty has been only partially effective.  Home employment in the boot factories has increased from 539 when the duty was imposed to 1,074 on the 1st December, 1928, a two-fold increase, but the import of boots and shoes in the year 1928 amounted to £1,170,000, compared with £1,951,086 in 1924.  The quantity of boots and shoes imported has actually increased. The home industry produces about eleven per cent. of the requirements.  Obviously there is very great room for extension.  The Minister must recognise that that tariff of 15 per cent. is not sufficient. It is well known that those who import these articles can pay the tariff, and whether it is due to the retailer or not, we can buy foreign boots and shoes in this country at cheaper prices than the home-made article. Finance is being used, and savagely used, in exploiting the unemployed, where cheap labour can be found, and when the Irish workers have reached that stage of starvation which the Minister for Industry and Commerce once described as being necessary before they adopt his point of view, a point of view of which he afterwards gave an earnest when he paid the Shannon workers 32/- per week, I have no doubt that, according to the point of view of his Department, we will have a happy and contented capitalist system established here.</P>
    <P>I have to accuse the Government of direct hostility towards the unemployed in this State.  I believe that they have inspired a policy of strikebreaking, a policy of lowering the wage standard of the workers.  We had further evidence of that here only last week in the attitude of the <Col N="475" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce towards the Shop Hours (Drapery) Act.  He refused to support a renewal of that Act in order to give his Department time to provide machinery for a full and comprehensive measure to regulate hours in that particular trade, knowing quite well that his attitude last week must inevitably lead to further trouble in this city when the Act expires next month.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I think that that incident alone is proof sufficient that he is not concerned about the conditions which obtain in this city, and when I informed him that young girls were being brought into the city, employed at rates of from five shillings to ten shillings per week and working 16 hours a day, he said that he had no representations on the matter. What is the Department of Industry and Commerce doing?  I am informed that various representations have been made to get that Department to take up the matter of hours and conditions in that and kindred trades.  The Minister for Agriculture still continues to advocate his policy of the 200-acre farm. He wants all those who are unable to hold the 200-acre farm to get cut of this country.  He will, of course. afford opportunities for employing a few men and women in opening and closing the gates of those 200-acre ranches on which will be fed cattle to provide John Bull with good Irish beef.</P>
    <P>That is the policy down through the last eight years which this Government have espoused and propagated, a policy the results of which we have now to face.  Perhaps the Ministry are satisfied with that policy and will hold so long as their term of office holds, but it is a consolation, at any rate, to know that their term of office is drawing to a close.  We have, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, 79,000 people living in one-roomed tenements in this city, tenements which have been condemned as unfit for human <Col N="476" /> habitation.  I have no doubt that the Minister will get up and in his usual sneering fashion will, as the Press will probably report tomorrow, tear the arguments of the Opposition to shreds.  He will, I suppose, show the inconsistencies between the points of view put forward by one Deputy and another but nevertheless, he cannot get away from the fact that this menace of hunger and starvation is still with us and is still growing.  He cannot get away from the fact that there is in this House and outside it a volume of opinion, represented at any rate by this party and by other Deputies I am sure, which is convinced that it is first of all the duty of any National Government to see to it that before anyone has too much no one shall be allowed to starve.</P>
    <P>No matter what radical alterations may be required in the administrative machinery that principle should be accepted, but it has not been accepted by this Government. The Minister for Finance and, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have repeatedly stated that it is not the duty of the Government to provide employment.  Very well, those who support this Vote and who oppose our amendment to refer it back must take their stand behind that declaration.  On the one hand, you have a Party in this House prepared to take responsibility and to stake their reputation on that principle and on giving effect to it.  We have had sufficient of this policy of free trade, emigration and hunger, and I hope that Deputies, particularly Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, will, when the Division bell rings, answer the call of their constituents.  Represent your constituents in this matter and, if you are satisfied that the Government have done everything possible that this great prosperity about which we hear so much is real and genuine, and that Ireland has turned the corner, follow the Ministers into the Division lobby.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has hurled an insult at the skilled workers of this country. He stated that they refused to pull their full weight in the matter <Col N="477" /> of output.  That is the first time, I think, that any responsible member of this House, any responsible man in public life, has charged the Irish workers with being slackers.  I refuse to believe that there is any truth in the statement, but, when Deputy Byrne charges them with not pulling their weight and, consequently, with imposing a further increase on the burden of costs, I ask those who hold that view what they think of the Directors of the I.O.C.? Are they pulling their weight when they refuse to recognise the right of employees to join whatever trade union they wish?  As a result they have caused a strike in the city and, incidentally, they have been given police protection, which involves extra cost on our expenditure.  There is, however, no charge put on the Directors of that Company for such protection.  I hold that there is no right to use that police protection as it is being used, in order to afford these people an opportunity of crushing the employees into defeat.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has been in this House for the past few years cannot. of course, hope that as a result of this debate any radical change of attitude will result.  All we can do in the circumstances is to repeat our appeals to the people who can compel the Ministers to change their attitude, the members of the Government Party, and to them once again, fruitless as it may appear, I make that appeal.  In this connection I will quote an extract from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; in reference to the great Civic Week display of last year.  When the leading article of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; sheds tears over the poverty and misery of our people surely it is time for members of Cumann na nGaedheal to waken up to the fact.  Dealing with that great display, and referring to the stoppage of transport which occurred at that time, the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot exonerate the authorities, national and municipal, of blame for yesterday's event.  Dublin is beflagged and illuminated, and the organisers of Civie Week bid the citizens and <Col N="478" /> the stranger to admire her amenities and her happy prospects. Behind the gala decorations of the main streets, however, there lies a wilderness of slums, where the light of prosperity never shines, and where ill-fed children are bred in dirt to recruit the ranks of the unemployable.  As if to exasperate the chronic misery of so large a proportion of the city's people, a stoppage of the greater portion of the public transport system has been allowed to last for a month, relegating one of the most respectable branches of the city's wage earners to idleness, and crushing the hope of a much-needed &lsquo;boom&rsquo; in general business.  Observers marvel at the detachment of the powers of the moment from the needs and the sentiments of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  Of course, it is dealing merely with the question of the stoppage of the tramway service and pointing to the hunger and misery of the unemployed, but if that same &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; brought the Ministry to boot on anything in connection with their disloyalty to Imperial institutions in this country they would immediately respond.  There is no need to answer to the crack of the Unionist whip when there is involved only such trivial matters as those which affect the ordinary citizen.  When the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; shouts in defence of Empire the Ministry answer without hesitation.  They have always answered, and will continue to answer, the call, but the calls of hungry citizens and hungry children go unheeded, and will continue to go unheeded.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister, when replying, to deal specifically with the simple question with which I prefaced my remarks, as to whether the Government have used the powers in their possession to the best advantage to deal with this problem.  If so, is the Minister prepared to state that, having used those powers, he has to admit that he cannot find a solution, that he cannot hope to find a solution in the near future, or at any <Col N="479" /> time in the future?  There is no use in quoting statistics and figures, and telling us what has been done.  We do not want to know what has been done, but what can be done.  The evil is now greater than ever.  I ask the Minister not to go over the same ground as the other apologists have covered.  Nothing will be gained by that.  Face up to the realities of the situation.  Tell us if you can solve the problem.  If you cannot solve it, make room for those who can, and will, find a solution if they get the opportunity.</P>

      <P>Deputies on this side of the House who have been listening to the speeches of the Opposition must be possessed of a great deal of patience.  Never in the history of any assembly was there a more unjust attack made on a Government than that made to-day. In the first place, the Government have been put on trial for their eight years' work.  I ask any member of this House, or any citizen of the Free State, who knew Dublin eight or nine years ago, and who walks through its streets to-day, whether he cannot honestly say that a great change for the better has come over the city.  Dublin is extending its wings, and giving employment on all sides.  Men are employed in every suburb around the city, and there is an air of gladness and joyousness everywhere.  To-day I had an interview with a few humble workmen. I asked them what the prospects for labour were in the city, and they told me that they were exceedingly good.  Despite that, we are told that there is nothing but misery and starvation everywhere.  Go round the city to-day and you will find men working in every direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, you may take it for granted that the activity that characterise Dublin is also in operation down in Cork.  The same activity will pass along throughout the Free State if the Government are only treated with fair play.  I have been here for the last few years and I must honestly say to the electors in the Twenty-six Counties that I <Col N="480" /> have seen practically no measures that were brought in here to do away with unemployment and to do good for the people of the Free State that were not opposed by the gentlemen who should be in sackcloth and ashes on account of the misery they brought to the country.  Was there ever such humbug preached in any country as the speeches they have delivered here?  Deputy Lemass knows as a citizen of Dublin that Dublin is on the upgrade.  Let him examine his own books and take stock and he will find that he himself is steadily growing in prosperity. There is a system in vogue of running down the State and saying it is bankrupt.  Yet, the Minister for Finance got £6,000,000 in one week and he would get twenty millions as readily for the building up of the State if the Depnties on the opposite benches played a rôle different from the rôle they are playing now.  The rôle they are playing now is to belittle the State and to &ldquo;down&rdquo; the State.  I was listening to Deputy O'Kelly saying the other day in the Dáil that we were a miserable, dark, little spot in the Atlantic Ocean, that we had no status and no friends, and that we should remain isolated from all the world.  Is that to be the policy in the twentieth century when every small nation is forging ahead and endeavouring to increase in wealth and prosperity?  Are we to remain on the roadside?  Are we not to take our share in the great era of prosperity?  The Deputies opposite attacked the Government because they sent their ambassadors to Geneva.  We will send them all over the world where they will be of help to the country and the electors of the Twenty-six Counties will manfully come along and support the Government in carrying the flag of the Free State in triumph.</P>

I recognise that there is <Col N="481" /> a vast improvement in the slums as compared with what they were when I first visited them.  I have been coming to a council in Dublin every year for the last 40 years in connection with the poor, and I noticed a decided improvement in that respect. If you, sir, and the Deputies around you will only co-operate with the Government here I promise faithfully&mdash;I will not be wrong in making the promise&mdash;that the slums will gradually disappear.  How can they disappear when you are blocking the Government at every step? When there was a Vote for a quarter of a million brought in in connection with the Gaeltacht did you give the Minister a &ldquo;laudate&rdquo;?  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce brought in a scheme for the electrification of the Shannon, you denounced it as an extravagance and a waste of public money.  Now you say <i>laudate.</i>  What sort of policy is that?  For God's sake, change your policy, throw your weight in with us, and drop your nonsense.</P>

I do not want to say anything more about it than this&mdash;that there will be no decrease in unemployment, but rather an increase, if there is any persistence in the type of conduct that seems to meet with approval here, if there is any furthering of particular methods adopted in a trade dispute by insisting that police protection should not be afforded to property&mdash;in other words, that workers will not make up their minds as to whether or not they want compulsory arbitration not upon one question but upon all questions but prefer to have used methods of hooliganism in order to drive one party to a dispute into arbitration with another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has gone on the usual lines.  The panaceas for unemployment are protection, the setting up of some sort of development commission, certain agricultural experiments that some people would like to have made, and repudiation of certain debts.  All these experiments are advocated and all these suggestions are put forward by people who confess themselves that they do not know what the extent of the problem is.  I have on many occasions brought forward here the unemployment-register figures.  I bring them forward again.  In bringing those figures forward, I have always stated the limitations that have to be read into them.  I give the limitations again.  In so far as the live register is concerned, it may mainly be taken&mdash;but not entirely&mdash;as a record of those who were at some time or another in insurable occupation. Therefore, it may be stated to exclude almost entirely&mdash;but not entirely&mdash;those engaged in agricultural occupations.  There is a live-register figure at the moment of something like 18,000.  That represents substantially the volume of the unemployment in this country which deserves consideration.  If the system that is employed at the moment for getting those figures is not a sound system, there is no other system of getting the figures than that of sending round Civic Guards every week to every house in the State to inquire: &ldquo;Are you or are you not an unemployed person?&rdquo;  People who feel the pressure of unemployment and who realise that many thousands of vacancies are filled annually through the Exchanges may, without any expense or trouble <Col N="483" /> to themselves, get registered as unemployed. What is the full extent of their obligations in order to get on the register?  They have to get a scrap of paper and something in which to enclose that scrap of paper; they must have the capacity to write and they must have writing material; without expense to themselves they can, if thus equipped, send forward their names to the office without expense to themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantages are that 16,000 vacancies annually have been filled over the past six years from the people who notified themselves to the Exchanges.  That is, at least, an incentive to register. If a man is unemployed and will not take the trouble to get a scrap of paper and, without even the cost of a postage stamp, send forward his name to the office, then I say the pressure of unemployment is not so severe on that person that he should really be considered here at all. What other system is there for getting these men to register if that is not good enough?  Are we to have people going round and collecting names?  Are we to send round inquirers, or are we to have a weekly or monthly statement furnished by the police as to conditions in their areas when all that is required is that an individual shall get a piece of paper, write his name upon it and send it to the office, without even putting a stamp on the envelope?  If a man does not take that amount of trouble to register as unemployed, his case is hardly worth consideration.</P>

      <P>I might get a comparison of that sort made, but it has not been made.  There are less than 20,000 people who take the trouble to get a scrap of paper and, without expense to themselves, drop it into a pillar-box for transmission to the office, notwithstanding that it has been bruited through the country for some years past that so many notified vacancies are filled each year through the medium of the exchanges. Is that a good system or is it not?  Is it a system that will get recorded those upon whom unemployment really presses?  And if it is not a system that will effect that, let us have some suggestion as to the system that will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the fact.  That is a simple answer to a simple question.  If I am asked to do so, I will have a segregation of those figures made, but what the Deputy suggests is not the fact. That figure is, at any rate, some indication of the extent of the problem. I say no more of it than this: taking the limitations&mdash;I am cutting out of my calculations agriculturally-employed people who have never been in insurable occupation; that means people so completely tied up in agricultural occupations that they have never even worked on a road scheme in the last two or three years&mdash;so far as people ever were in insurable occupations, the register is substantially accurate in respect of those on whom unemployment presses to the point that they will take the trouble to get their names recorded in the way I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard here Deputy Cooney and other Deputies talk about free trade.  Where is there free trade in this country?  When that phrase is used there is no sense of proportion.  I have given a calculation over and over again, and I have given some of the details on which the calculation is founded.  I <Col N="485" /> know it is an arbitrary distinction in some ways.  But the figures should be taken and argued about.  I took the list of goods coming into this country in the year 1925.  I divided those goods into two classes&mdash;goods that could be tariffed and goods that could not be tariffed.  My calculation was that 50 per cent. of the tariffable imports had been tariffed. On my calculation 50 per cent. of the goods that could be tariffed were tariffed in two years.  And yet we are a free trade country!  Deputy Lemass said that he drove us to that. Deputy de Valera said, somewhere down the country during the weekend, that Fianna Fáil had driven us to this limited scheme of protection. These tariffs were imposed in 1924 and 1925 when Fianna Fáil were blathering in the wilderness about oaths.  They did not know what was going on here with regard to economies. They were more concerned about the nonsense described in the two documents, (A) and (B), which were published recently on demand from the other side.</P>

      <P>They were more concerned as to whether the President of the Republic, being a barrister, could practise under what he called English law, and whether according to English law the Republic was existent or non-existent, and nonsense of that kind, than they were about economics. That is what Deputies were doing in 1924 and 1925.  This House was then imposing tariffs on 50 per cent. of the tariffable imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the result of tariffing 50 per cent. of our imports?  About 15,000 people put directly into employment.  That 15,000 is really an illusory figure, because it is a 15,000 figure when one scales down part-time employment to conditions of full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That 15,000 is a record of 15,000 people engaged full-time in occupations at the moment.  There are probably <Col N="486" /> 20,000 people brought into work through the tariffs, but sealing all that down, three-quarters time work and half-time work, to the sort of economic figure here, where the man is engaged full-time the whole year round, fifteen thousand people are put into occupations directly through tariffs.  The figure of those indirectly concerned is a little bit more conjectural.  In the beginning when factories were being built we had machinery and plant brought in and there was widespread subsidiary employment in the way of the building trades.  Probably the indirect figure might rise to 5,000.  At the moment put it as low as 3,000. There are 18,000 people on the unemployment list.  Of the insurable occupations, that is, people who take the trouble to write their names on a sheet of paper and post it to the office, there are 20,000.  There are 18,000 at the moment.  You might say if the 50 per cent. tariffable imports had not been tariffed that figure would have been double what it is at the moment.  Yet this is a free trade country and people talk in terms of free trade and what Fianna Fáil might have done in the years 1924 and 1925.  I am going to leave out of my calculations in this debate altogether such things as the amalgamation of the railway system, a very big move that was beneficial to trade and industry in this country. I am going to leave out of my calculations at the moment the Shannon scheme and all the attendant benefits that scheme has brought and is going to bring, and all the bigger and more spectacular things, so that we can concentrate on employment that is being given to industries that once were alive and prosperous and how that employment is being increased and new employment is being given through the simple machinery of attending to the industries and making suggestions to those who are likely to introduce new industries into the country. Fianna Fáil wants&mdash;a useful way to avoid discussing things themselves&mdash; a big development commission and economic council.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said there is nobody at the moment who is looking <Col N="487" /> after industry in the country. Various speakers on the Fianna Fáil side said that nobody is looking at industries at present, and seeing how tariffs have resulted, and where changes in the tariffing might be beneficial to the country and the industries concerned.  They are being looked after without the spectacular setting up of an economic council with all the benefits that economic council or anyone can think of can bring already there.  I have around me in my Department all the industries in this country grouped into thirty-three committees.  Some of these committees do not meet because when you write to them and ask them things that are troubling them, and things in which intervention might be useful to them, their answer is that they are going along steadily, and that they do not require meetings.  Sometimes we get them to come to discuss matters.  We have thirty-three groups representing industries in this country.  We have the best brains industry in this country has been able to produce in these committees.  We get the best evidence of what is being done, and what changes they think are required to bring an improvement in the situation.  We get them in to discuss, one committee with the other, and with trade representatives of our own and other people, with a view to securing markets here and elsewhere.  Yet we are told there is no attention being paid to industry in the country.</P>
    <P>I quoted here a remark which was made on one occasion by one of those committees representing the best brains that particular industry had in this country, and Deputy de Valera, who left this country a second-class honours man in the University, and came back to find himself a scholar of European repute, characterises this statement as imbecile.  Anyone who knows anything about industrialists will say to the industrialists that that remark is imbecility.  We get information from them.  We get consultations when they are required, and we follow up the progress of the tariffs <Col N="488" /> in the industry.  I hold certain of the tariffs are at this moment putting an extra cost on the consumer. I hold that most of them, in the beginning, put an extra cost upon the consumer.  I hold that the biggest groups, as far as articles go, are imposing no cost upon the consumer at the moment, but certain groups, and, unfortunately, the groups, although few in numbers, are the groups that contain most articles imported into the country, do impose a certain cost upon the consumer.</P>
    <P>I think of the groups that were attended to in 1924 and 1925 that the consumer in the Free State, if he is not minded to buy a luxury article, if his mind does not run that way, can get himself articles of equal quality at at least as good a price as the English consumer of English-manufactured articles in the following things: tobacco, soap and candles, margarine and blankets and oatmeal, metallic bedsteads, jam and sugar confectionery and cocoa preparations. I include the last two although there is still a big import shown&mdash;the import is of a luxury type&mdash;because of the reservation I made that if a man is looking for good value he can get Irish stuff as good in those as the Englishman is getting from his English-manufactured things.  In that group there are two or three points to be challenged. There is an import still shown under the heading of jam. That includes other things than jam, and there is an import shown under the heading of sugar confectionery and oatmeal preparations.  Under the import of oatmeal there is a certain breakfast preparation which people are brought to buy because of long-continued advertising.  They are continuing to buy it, and something approaching prohibition of that import would be required to stop the purchase of it.  If such prohibition is recommended that brings us to the question of sumptuary laws and of preventing people from eating things they want to eat. To that I shall come later on.  In the matter of jam there is an import of about £36,000 shown, but that includes fruit jellies, and it is mainly in that particular item that the import <Col N="489" /> is shown.  As far as sugar confectionery and cocoa are concerned I have indicated that there are still higher grades of sweets and chocolates coming in from the other side and being bought, but if the consumer is not looking for the luxury article he can cut himself free from any extra cost now after four or five years.  In most of these articles there was an increase at the beginning. I do not think that any of the manufacturers would deny that in the beginning there was an increase in most of these articles.</P>

      <P>Let me go on.  I mentioned certain things.  With regard to these I held that the consumer at the moment is not paying anything more, need not pay anything more, than the consumer in England of English manufactured goods of equal quality.</P>
      <P>There are certain items in which the consumer, I think, is still paying more&mdash;boots and shoes, clothing, hosiery, furniture and glass bottles. I am going to leave two of these out of my calculations.  They do not amount to much, glass bottles and hosiery.  Hosiery is a peculiar business. In so far as it is concerned, the figures of 1926, in the census production of that year, show that £250,000 worth were produced.  The import for the same year was about £1,000,000.  There was a total consumption here of one and a quarter million pounds.  We believe that in regard to articles made in the country in the line of hosiery the consumer is not paying anything extra, but that he or she is paying for what is brought in from outside. Why is there anything brought in from outside?  Mainly because certain poorer people want to buy a particular type of cotton goods and certain other people want to buy artificial silk goods.  If you are going to block that you get again into the region of sumptuary laws and the prevention of purchases.</P>

      <Col N="490" /> Furniture is of less importance than the boots and shoes or the clothing either.  Again taking the census of production figures of 1926 there was produced in this country, £400,000 worth of furniture.  There was imported £100,000, a total consumption of half a million.  We believe, and I have got the figure agreed by certain people in the industry, that the consumer of Irish furniture is paying 10 per cent. more than the man buying the same type of furniture in England, produced in England.  This could be said up to seven months ago.  Those buying imported furniture were paying the full amount of the tariff in whatever was coming in.  The two big items outstanding in this calculation are boots and shoes and clothing.  The census of production figures of 1926 show that there was a production in this country of £340,000 worth and a total import of £1,800,000, total consumption being £2,140,000.  Let us separate the imported article and the home manufactured article.  The best evidence that can be got with regard to the imported article is that the full tariff is being charged.  On the home manufactured article, it is very hard to get a proper figure.  I would not go to the point of saying that the full 15 per cent. is being charged to the buyer of the Irish boot or shoe, but there is some percentage being paid extra, something about 7 per cent.  I do not agree with the foolish statement Deputy Cooney made that the foreign boot of equal quality can be bought far cheaper than the home manufactured article. I think that is nonsense, but I do think that the consumer, to the difference between £340,000 and £2,140,000 has yet to rely on the imports and that the consumer of these imported articles is paying the full amount of the tariff.  He is paying about 7 per cent. on the home manufactured article.  Supposing he is paying nothing you must spread over the whole boot purchasing community the full amount of the tariff.</P>
    <P>But the consuming population is paying something more by reason of that tariff.  With regard to clothing, <Col N="491" /> I have again to take the figures of the census of production, which are the most reliable I can get.  For all classes of clothing except hosiery the total production in the Free State in 1926 was about £1,750,000, and in the same year the total import was 3¼ million pounds.  There was a total consumption of about five million pounds.  Of the £1,750,000 made in the Free State at least £1,000,000, probably something over that, was composed of shirts and men's and boys' clothing, and we are convinced, from all the examinations we can make, that in all shirting, and I think in all boy's clothing, and in most men's clothing, the consumer is not paying anything extra.  Take £1,000,000 off the £5,000,000 consumption, and of the £4,000,000 worth remaining something extra is being paid by the consumer&mdash;a maximum of 15 per cent., and a minimum anywhere you like below that&mdash; except that one must take this into consideration, that the vast majority of the clothes represented in that £4,000,000 was ladies' clothing, of which very little is made in this country.  That has to be spread over the purchasing community.</P>
    <P>The consumer is being charged something extra on clothing and on boots and shoes, and that is after some of the tariffs have been in operation for six years and some for five years.  If I had made a similar statement a couple of years after the tariffs were imposed it would look much worse.  But, at any rate, for boots and shoes and clothing&mdash;I will leave furniture out of consideration, because it is not purchased very often, and when people do purchase it they do not bother much about the sum expended&mdash;the main items in respect of which some cost is imposed on the consumer by reason of our tariffs&mdash;we get 15,000 people directly into employment and, say, another 3,000 indirectly employed.  I take that 15,000, which is an accurate return of the employment, actually found to exist, and I compare it with the employment that was claimed when applications were coming forward for tariffs on these items.  I <Col N="492" /> know that a great deal more employment was claimed as likely to result than that 15,000.  I take all the other articles of the 50 per cent. tariffable, but not yet taxed, imports, in nearly all of which applications for tariffs at some time or other have been made, I scale down their claims by an amount proportionate to reach a figure corresponding to the 15,000 and I find that if we put on all the tariffs that were asked on the other 50 per cent. of tariffable imports we might get 10,000 people employed, and with a cost to the consumer, five years after, of nothing like what I have given here.  There would be a greater cost to the consumer.  We had to bear in mind that when tariffs were put on first there was no trained customs staff and that discrimination meant delay and expense, but we took the tariffs that showed themselves likely to give immediate employment, those where benefit was likely to be got almost immediately, and those which we postponed were those for which a case did not seem proveable at the time, and therefore those that were likely to impose a greater cost relatively than the ones we took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister's case not against tariffs, but against inadequate tariffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  There have been 15,000 people given employment, and we might get another 10,000.  The 15,000 cost something to the consumer in the way of increased cost of living, and the 10,000 that we would get from the rest of the tariffs if they were imposed would cost more.  As to the Deputy's interjection with regard to the inadequacy of the tariffs, I refer again to my thirty-three advisory committees.  There is no tariffed industry that I have not represented by a group.  I consult them with regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of a tariff, and my Department gets considerable help from them.  If any industry feels that a tariff at present imposed is badly placed, that it does not give discrimination as they think there <Col N="493" /> should be discrimination, or that it is not high enough, we assist them, and we ask them to move forward with a case to the Tariff Commission. In the case of how many industries have the Tariff Commission themselves thought that the tariff is not adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say, but the Minister knows that in the case of very few applications was the full tariff asked for given.  The estimate of employment made was generally based upon the full tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And therefore would be higher than what is here. We come to the fact that tariffs have been imposed and that in only one case have we been able to get the advisory committee to proceed to the Tariff Commission to get a change made.  I think that the judgment of these committees is the best. We do not agree with their judgments in everything, but I think these matters are hardly for outsiders. Unless they can show that they have a prima facie case, that they have a better knowledge of the facts, that the tariff is not adequate and that they must have a bigger one&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They asked for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They asked for it in the beginning.  Naturally everyone puts his claim high.  We are pressing them steadily with regard to employment and questioning them as to why more employment is not given, questioning them, say in the boot industry, as to why there is not an increase in the quantity of boots and shoes turned out.  I will take boots as one instance.  The manufacturers will not go to the Tariff Commission for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not because there is a general fear amongst manufacturers that if higher tariffs were imposed there would be a big rush into the country of British and foreign capitalists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such fear current generally in industry, <Col N="494" /> and that case could be met when it was put up.  But there is the situation.  The people who are best qualified to judge do not make any case about inadequate tariffs. Are we to set up some sort of economic committee to say to people: &ldquo;The tariff is not enough for you, we are going to impose a bigger one?&rdquo;  Yet that is apparently what is being asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever had an application from the boot factory in Waterford for an increase? I understood that they wanted one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I deal here not with individual factories but with the boot factory committee, and the Waterford factory has a representative on that committee.  I deal with the committee as a whole and they make representations to me.  If one man in a particular business were to ask me for an increase which the committee did not back up, I would not go on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that certain boot manufacturers did oppose an increase of the tariff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, they did.  The adequacy of a tariff should be raised through the advisory committee. But to complain that nothing has been done with regard either to new industries being tariffed or with regard to an improvement in the tariff in the case of industries which have already had its benefit is simply shutting one's eyes to the fact that these people are grouped together, that the best brains of all the industries in the country are in these advisory committees, that you have in them a combination of the best of them that no economic council could give.  I can tell the House, from experience of these business men, that Irish business men on the whole in the present state of affairs are more inclined each to look after his own business than to go delving into general economic considerations, and in the present circumstances the best way that one can get effective work <Col N="495" /> done is by insisting that each man delves deeply into the business which he knows well, of which he has experience, and in which his whole capital is.  In that way we hope to get development, and not by a general economic committee that would do nothing.  If there is any body to do an economic committee's work it is my Department, and I say that it is doing it.  There is not an industry tariffed or not tariffed that we have not touch with through these groups.</P>
      <P>There are industries that are not in the country at the moment whose representatives we do not meet, and yet we try to induce people to take them up.  There is a great deal of information available with regard to industries not at the moment existent here, and any amount of information has been put before people who showed the slightest evidence that they were likely to embark in any one of these industries.  All the information that is required is at hand.  I would like to hear anybody make the case, and establish it by one example, that information was asked on anything upon which the Department might if it were an efficient Department be expected to have information and the applicant finding himself unable to get what he required.  One example of that type would be worth all the floods of oratory that we have here about the absence of effort on the part of the Government to get industries going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what I have said about the small number of people relatively that might be brought into employment if we tariffed everything, and the increased cost to the consumer that might result&mdash;I say no more than &ldquo;might result&rdquo;&mdash;there is another side to economic activities in this country.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that we have Messrs.  Ford's at present working in Cork, with 7,000 men employed at not a penny cost to the consumers in this country through their activities. We have Messrs. Jacobs giving employment in this city to the extent of 3,000 people.  Divide those people on the basis of the amount of the <Col N="496" /> firm's products consumed here and the amount exported and you will find that at least 2,500 have employment on account of the export trade and 500 on account of the home trade, and I doubt whether it would come to as much as 500.  Estimate Messrs. Guinness in the same way. In so far as they have an export business it may be said that they do not cost the consumer in this country a penny.  We must keep that side of things going.  Whether people like it or not we are tied, and we will be tied for a long time, to the European community, and whether people like it or not, in the European community at the moment there is a very definite drive against tariffs.  We will have to enter into trade relations with European countries with a view to keeping the 7,000 people employed in Messrs. Fords and the 2,500 employed in Messrs. Jacobs, and we will have to make trade treaties with European nations which are setting their faces against tariffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What European nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost any European nation.  The one nation which could be said at Geneva last year to have as completely favourable an attitude on protection as ourselves was Yugo-Slavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But the trend of tariffs is upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The position with regard to tariffs is that they are much higher elsewhere than here, but there is no trend upwards at all.  If Deputies had to deal with these trade treaties they would realise that we have to keep certain a protectionist policy when we think it good, when we think we will get employment through it without any great cost to the consumer, but that we must also dovetail into the European system for the reason that we want to sell the products of the two firms I mentioned to those countries, and we must be caught to some extent in the drift of their whole economic policy. <Col N="497" /> We have to make these trade treaties for the good of our industries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass sneered, in another connection, at the fixing of a modus vivendi with Turkey.  I told him afterwards when he asked what crisis there was in our affairs that caused us to jump into that suddenly, that there was an actual crisis.  There has hardly been a trade treaty that we have entered into&mdash;either an arrangement or a treaty or a modus vivendi&mdash;that we had not to start in at the behest of either of those two firms, and sometimes other firms, because we have exports from other firms besides those two.  I am stressing those two firms because they are the biggest, if one is to measure from the point of view of employment. There are other productive industries that we must attend to, because some portion of their products are going abroad, and we have to pay attention to this side of things. It may come to this: that at some time this country will have to make its choice and have a ring around itself, try to be self-supporting and try to sell everything that is produced here to the people in the country and not bother about an export trade, because we may not be able to get an export trade.  The best policy at the moment is to keep both ends going, to get another 15,000 employed here, to get others, such as the woollen manufacturers and other manufacturers, to make their way and give extra employment with small cost to the consumer. The best policy is to have some of the unemployed brought in by reason mainly of an export business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any industry thinks it can make a case for a tariff, it can go before the Tariff Commission.  I cannot deal with any argument put forward in this House of the insinuating type that Deputy Cooney used with regard to the people on the Tariff Commission.  There are people there who can be examined from any point of view&mdash;their past history, what is called their record, and their <Col N="498" /> whole outlook nationally.  It may be said that the Tariff Commission, judged in that way, have a very much more pronounced national bias than most of their critics.  The Tariff Commission metes out justice.  It was established because the officials of my Department and myself felt that we could not examine thoroughly the applications from various industries.  We had to examine them thoroughly in order to get at the exact facts of the situation. There were certain industries that we did deal with.  They were plain sailing, but there were others that were not.  What is the position we have achieved by dealing with tariffs in that way?  This is a very big thing: there is hardly anybody to be found in the country at the moment who is free trade.  There is hardly anybody who has suspicions about the tariffs that were put on. It is notable&mdash;notorious&mdash;that in countries that go in more and more for whole-hog protection the element of corruption, of trying to get after people to secure votes, of lobbying&mdash; everything that can be summed up in that use of the word corruption, not in its criminal sense&mdash;comes to the top.  Everything of that nature comes up as the country goes more and more deeply into the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs.  We have achieved the position that at the moment there is no tariff put on that is not backed by the big majority of the people.  The farming community &mdash;and the farmers are the most conservative class in any country&mdash; accepted these tariffs.  Will they accept the imposition of every tariff &mdash;of tariffs as they are suggested for every article?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it be tried and see.  Will they accept all these tariffs put on at the one go?  We risked putting a pretty big burden on them in two years when we imposed that list of tariffs on them. Remember that in the early years my statement about these articles would have to be different from the statement I make now.  Are we <Col N="499" /> going now in one sweep to put tariffs on everything else?  The essence of the complaint is that we are not going fast enough.  The method of selection is the better one and it is one that Deputies on the other side at last seem to be coming to.  Deputy de Valera, who used to talk about tariffs and about protection in its most extreme form, issued a statement on unemployment a year ago. His phrase was that &ldquo;We stand for the protection of all articles that can economically be manufactured at home.&rdquo;  I do not know any better definition of selective protection. Deputy Lemass said that we could get all our unemployed people at home employed within 10 years.</P>

      <P>Am I being asked about the unemployment that is here and what is being done in regard to it?  I am not answering on that. I am leaving out transport, the Shannon scheme, relief works and drainage.  I am dealing mainly with the industrial present and the industrial future of this country as one item of this question of employment and unemployment.  That is the situation as I see it from the angle of my own Department with regard to industries giving employment. We have done everything that any spectacular economic commission can do.  We have got the best touch with industrialists&mdash;men interested in their own industries.  We have solicited enquiries from abroad.  We have brought people in this country not interested in a particular line of business into touch with the facts and we have given them data which <Col N="500" /> they would be likely to find useful. There is a wealth of material collected by the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputies say that nothing has been done, and that we should have an Economic Commission.  What is the great secret of the Economic Commission? Is it that we are to call in experts from outside to examine into the state of this country, to suggest industries where they are not at present, to suggest how industries here might develop more speedily, and give better results, or is it that we are to collect businessmen, or are we to have the maligned civil servant brought into it?  The civil servant is in it already, and the businessman is in it already; even the foreign experts are in it already, looking into different matters, getting data, and trying to formulate reports.  What is required more than what has been done?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass is always given to wild statements.  Speaking on the 28th May on the Finance Bill he said that the problems of unemployment and emigration are very serious here. He pointed out that Deputies who read the news in the papers were aware how greatly the failure of the existing British Government to remedy the unemployment situation was perturbing the people of that country.  He said: &ldquo;Deputies who study the American and German newspapers in the library here know how greatly the unemployment problem is disturbing the people of those countries.&rdquo;  Has the Deputy any appreciation of figures?  The Deputy put the number of unemployed people here at 50,000.  On that he bases the statement that we have an unemployment problem as big as there is in America, Germany and Britain.  Does the Deputy stand over that?</P>

      <P>Prohibition of every import would mean that nothing would come in.  Whether you are going to get a happy economic state of things hereafter that is another matter.  Whether you are going to get anything at all that would make up for the loss of 10,000 employees as between Fords and Jacobs is an important consideration. <Col N="503" /> What one has to do in a matter of this sort is to act with discretion and to act so that the people will not suffer.</P>
      <P>The way to protection is the way we have chosen as the best.  We have got people in harmony and agreement on it.  We have come to the point that on the tariffs in force, with one exception, there is pretty definitely a good conscience in the country: a feeling that these tariffs were imposed because they were necessary; that there was no &ldquo;hugger-mugger&rdquo; about the imposition of them.  There is one exception which I quoted before, that of margarine. That is suspect, and is suspect because of the way in which a certain applicant for that tariff behaved. I spoke of this before, and I have waited to hear a statement in defence made in the Seanad.  I hope to get it in the Seanad; I am going to raise it when the Bill goes there.</P>

They put in an application, they heard a statement made in the early summer and they took six months after that before they decided to withdraw. Having withdrawn, they made contradictory statements as to the reason why they did withdraw.  A statement was made in the House of which that Senator was a member that the reason why six months' delay had occurred was because that gentleman was trying to get an allocation of output as between himself and another firm.

      <P>We are asked for proofs of employment in this country.  I have from time to time given proofs.  I have quoted the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the way it has grown.  I gave the returns from the sale of stamps.  There is no test equal to that as a test of the growth of employment.  If there are people in employment paying contribution <Col N="510" /> to the Unemployment Insurance Fund that is tested by the stamps bought centrally.  If the number of stamps purchased goes up, there are more people in employment. There are more people purchasing stamps because they are in employment and the fund has gone up.  There are innumerable evidences of a similar type with regard to employment and there is the outstanding figure I quoted before of less than 20,000 who think it worth while to get a sheet of paper, write their names on it, without any trouble to themselves other than that of walking to the nearest pillar box, and without the expense of putting a stamp on it, and registering themselves as people who feel the burden of employment pressing upon them. That is the figure we have to deal with.  We have reduced it to that. If it had not been for what we have done it would still be about 45,000 instead of 20,000.  We claim that is a good record and a record that is not going to be equalled by any imposition of a whole heap of tariffs or any setting out of economic theories.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £40,235 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
      <P>The decrease which is shown here is particularly due to less provision for temporary clerical assistance. That arises from the fact that certain classes of temporary work in connection with compensation, and also in connection with repayment of the Dáil Eireann Loan, require less extra staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Vote there are one or two matters which we, on this side of the House, are anxious to raise.  The first of these is a matter which was raised, I think, not only on this year's financial statement, but on the financial statement for the year preceding, that is the matter of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, in which the State, through the Minister for Finance, has a certain interest.  This company, as most of the members of the House are aware, was formed in 1926.  Its directors include a number of well-known men, including the Chairman of the Independent Newspapers, Ltd.  It was formed, I believe, to <Col N="513" /> finance industrial and commercial undertakings in the Free State, and particularly to make loans in respect of which the service as to interest and redemption was guaranteed by the State, by the Government under the Trade Loans Act. The capital of the company is £250,000.  The capital issued and paid up amounts to £162,878, and in this company the Minister for Finance holds something like £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two remarkable features common to all the balance-sheets which have been issued by this company to which I think it is proper to direct the attention of the House.  From the first balance-sheet covering the period from the inception of the company to the 31st December, 1927, it is clear that all the money advanced by the company under loans guaranteed by the Government had been borrowed from the Bank.  That left virtually all the paid-up capital of the company, including the Minister's £50,000, which was originally intended to finance and develop Irish industry, free for investment in other securities.  The loans made under the Government guarantee carried interest at 6 per cent., and the value of such loans made was £208,363.  The gross interest earned on these loans, therefore, could not have exceeded £12,500, and we may assume that the banks which advanced the money to finance the loan would have charged a rate of interest at, say, five per cent. on their £208,000.  So that against £12,000 gross earnings on loans we have to set off interest due to the banks upon the money used to finance them at £10,418, leaving net earnings on guaranteed loans about £2,000.  Assuming that the entire capital of the company which, as I have shown, was not invested in these Government guaranteed loans was invested, say, in gilt-edged securities either of this State or of some other State, that capital would not have earned more than £9,773, and if we set aside about £2,000 to cover working expenses and management, we find that the net profit for <Col N="514" /> the first year's operation of this company should have been, say, about £9,512.  But the first balance-sheet reveals that the total profit made by the company in the first year of working was £20,367; and that is a very remarkable figure for this company, the business of which was strictly limited, or, if not strictly limited, should have been strictly limited.  In view of the fact that the Minister and the Government were making a substantial investment in this remarkable profit of £20,000 compels us to ask the question: in what way and for what purposes were the funds of the State which the Minister made available to this company used?  It is quite clear that they were not used for and were not devoted to the purposes of the Trades Loans Guarantee Act.  They were not devoted and were not used to finance and develop industry in this country, and the question which I would like to put to the Minister &mdash;he should be in a position to give this information to the House since he is represented on the Board&mdash;is what use was made of this £50,000 of the Irish people's money?</P>
    <P>Of course, when the first balance sheet became public property rumour got busy and we were told that the money&mdash;as I would like to repeat and emphasise so that there may not be any misunderstanding in the mind of any Deputy as to the purpose for which it was originally voted&mdash;which was intended to finance and develop Irish industry was utilised in a wild gamble on the London Stock Exchange.  Fifty thousand pounds of the Irish people's money was used to buy bogus gramophone shares, and probably used to buy Ner-Sag or other flimsy shares.  It was used for every other purpose except that for which it was voted by this House.</P>
    <P>Though, as I have said, the matter was raised twice, not only on this year's financial statement but on last year's financial statement, we have never succeeded in extracting from the Minister a clear statement of his attitude towards the company and as to the uses to which the money <Col N="515" /> of this State has been put.  He has preferred to remain silent.  The first year of the company was a remarkably successful one.  As a general rule, neophytes in speculation have extraordinary success.  We know the luck which attends the simpleton in these matters.  The following year, however, presented an unpleasant contrast, for in that year, the earnings of the company on trade loan advances at 6 per cent. did not exceed £13,856.  If the earnings on other investments had averaged five per cent. they would have amounted to £14,957, and interest on the company's bank loans and overdrafts at five per cent. would have amounted to £16,158.  If we add the first and second of those sums and subtract from the total we would get the gross earnings at £12,315.  That represents the gross amount that would be available for expenses and dividends if the company had confined its activities to the purpose for which it was originally established.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the picture. Some of the most prominent figures in financial life were on the Board, assisted by some of the Minister's nominees.  It will come as no surprise to the House, because the House is familiar with the methods of the Minister in making the national balance-sheet budget, to learn that though the actual profit returned by the directors was something like £24,982, that is, nominal earnings, and in the second balance-sheet certain investments were taken in at a cost of £291,947, the auditors appended a note to the effect that the market value on the 31st March, 1929, of these particular items which the directors returned at £291,947, was only £233,189. Therefore, the difference between the nominal profit returned by the directors and the actual figures of the balance-sheet showed a real loss of £58,757, exceeding by over £13,000 the total earnings of the company since its inception.  That was the story on the 31st March, 1929.</P>
    <P>On the 31/3/1930, we again had a profit of £14,851.  Again, in making <Col N="516" /> up this profit, there were investments in industrial and other undertakings returned by the directors at a valuation of £271,547.  Again, we have the auditors' note to the effect that the market value of these investments was only £199,000, showing a net deficiency on these investments, which were altogether outside the advances made by the company under foot of a Government guarantee of £72,547.  Therefore, instead of a book profit of £14,851 returned by the directors, there was an actual loss last year of £57,696.</P>
    <P>What is the present market value of the shares of this concern?  It has a capital, as I have said, of £250,000, and last year there was a loss of £57,696.  In the preceding year the loss was £58,757.  It has lost at the very least, so far as I can see, anything from 23 to 25 per cent. of its capital.  This loss has occurred, not as the result of investment in well-established undertakings, not as the result of any ventures in manufacturing or productive activity, but purely as a result of Stock Exchange speculation, indulged in by the directors of the company, including nominees of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What value would any person with a knowledge of finance and with a knowledge of the Stock Exchange, what value would any prospective buyer place on the shares of that company?  I am certain that he would never be so foolish as to value them at par.  No matter how new to the game he was, no matter how inexperienced, he would never return the 50,000 shares which the Minister holds as being worth £50,000.  What does the Minister do?  What value did he place on these shares in his financial statement? He valued his 50,000 shares at £50,000, putting par value on the shares of a company which already lost 23 per cent. of its capital.  Even if his nominees had failed in their duty, the Minister was not, I take it, unaware of what was being done by the company because the chairman, to give him credit, in his first speech at the meeting of the company, held, <Col N="517" /> I think, in February, 1928, stated that the company, in addition to advances to Irish industrial concerns, also made advances without the guarantee of the Government.  That amount, however, was comparatively small.  He went on to state that the company had participated from time to time in underwriting public issues and had invested approximately £250,000 in a very wide range of securities which were so spread over various forms of enterprise and in various countries as to obviate any risk in any one direction.</P>
    <P>The chairman and the company, unfortunately, had not been so prudent and far-sighted as they anticipated because, though they spread their investments wide and though apparently they did not exceed the bounds of prudence in the amount invested in any one particular undertaking, for two successive years the balance sheet shows a loss of between 23 and 25 per cent. of its capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as early as 1928, knew that these sorts of investments were being made.  The point which I wish to put to the House is that when he knew that this was being done he was guilty of breach of confidence and trust to this House, because this money was not voted by the Dáil to finance undertakings in any other country but this.  It was voted, I will almost say, to finance no undertakings except those carrying a Government guarantee.  Therefore, the moment that the Minister was made aware, through his nominees or through the public statement of the chairman, that the directors were exceeding the authority given to them by the Dáil, he ought immediately have come to the Dáil and ask either for additional sanction or to be authorised to withdraw the money and cut his losses.  There is one thing certain and that is, with the crying need which we have for capital to run our industries, that the people of this country would never contemplate this money being used to finance other industries, possibly in competition with their own.</P>
    <P>The secrecy which has shrouded <Col N="518" /> this whole transaction from the beginning is remarkable.  I mentioned a name at the beginning of my speech which indicated why the daily newspapers have been silent about this scandal&mdash;because it is nothing less than a scandal.  We know why the newspapers are silent.  I would like to know why the Minister is silent.  This is not a matter which the House can afford to take easily. When the Government takes the unusual step of investing public money in a private company it is most desirable that the company concerned should confine its activities as strictly as possible to the particular purpose for which it was formed and for which the Government gave its support.  It is equally desirable that full information should be available concerning the company's operations and financial results.  If any other course is followed it is inevitable that suspicions will be aroused which will damage not merely the credit of the Government but the nation as a whole.  It is quite clear from the figures which I have put before the House that this company exceeded the limits within which its activities should have been strictly confined. It is quite clear that the Minister had full information in his possession that it was exceeding those limits.  It is quite clear, therefore, that it was the duty of the Minister, as I have said, either to wind up the company or to come to the House and make a full disclosure of the position.  The newspapers have been silent.  The Minister has been silent.  I ask him why.  I say that it is an ugly thing from any point of view that he should be silent.  If these men abused their trust the first duty of the Minister, no matter whom he offended, no matter whether they were close friends and political partisans, was to expose that particular abuse.</P>
    <P>It should not have been left to the Opposition, after questioning the Minister on two previous occasions, to make this particular company the object of public debate in this House.  It would have better served the reputation of every man and of <Col N="519" /> every interest connected with that company if the Minister had been candid in the matter.  If these men suffer either in their public or in their private reputation as the result of this debate, then responsibility for that will lie on the shoulders of the Minister.  There were a number of other issues which I should have liked to raise on this Vote.  However, I shall leave the Minister to deal with the question of the Industrial Trust Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee is not correct when he says that it was intended that the Industrial Trust Company should not invest this money in other than guaranteed advances.  As a matter of fact, the question of guaranteed advances was regarded as only a temporary one, in so far as it was hoped the Industrial Company would make them.  We thought that the guaranteed advances were advances that might easily have been made by other agencies.  The Industrial Trust Company was established for the purpose of doing the ordinary industrial business that such companies do in other countries.  There was no such company here.  There was no company here which undertook the business of underwriting, the investment of money in business shares or the making of long-term advances to business undertakings. It was felt that the establishment of some such company was desirable. In order to facilitate the establishment of that company, a certain amount of Government money was invested in it.  Although it was arranged that there should be nominees of the Minister for Finance on the Board of Directors in order that the national point of view might not be lost sight of, there was no intention at any time that the company should be controlled from the Department of Finance.  It was intended that, once established, the ordinary discretion which a company exercises should be exercised by it, and that it should carry on its affairs in the ordinary business way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> It was recognised that if such a company were bound by the restrictions which would operate if it were controlled from the Department of Finance, it might make few or no mistakes, but it would not be able to attempt to do the business for which it was established.  I have from the beginning taken up the position that I, in my official capacity, was simply a shareholder in the company.  As a shareholder in the company, I have from time to time made representations to the company.  With regard to the investment of the company's money, it is obvious that if the company were not going to lose all its money, investment in Irish industries&mdash; apart from investment in the guaranteed loans which, I think, was very properly done by the company &mdash;could only be done very gradually.  It could only be done by looking out for favourable opportunities and waiting until such time as it could definitely assist some enterprise that had good prospects of success.  The company was regarded as being free to use its money.  The point of view we took was that when any suitable Irish enterprise offered it was the business of this company to invest money in it.  It was regarded as the duty of the directors who were nominated by the Minister for Finance to keep that point of view before the company, and to make sure that no suitable Irish enterprise was rejected merely because the prospects of earning were less than the prospects of earning in some outside concern.  It was recognised that while the company should regard it as its duty to assist Irish industries by investment or by underwriting issues of capital when a suitable occasion offered, it should be free to use its money in the way it thought most proper.</P>
    <P>It was definitely regarded as quite correct that the company should invest not merely in gilt-edged securities, but in good industrial securities. One of the needs which the company felt in dealing with Irish industries was the building up of some reserve fund which would enable <Col N="521" /> it to deal with Irish propositions on a freer basis.  The company undoubtedly met with misfortunes. I do not say that I, or an official of the Department of Finance, would have made the choice of investments that the company made.  As a matter of fact, on one or two occasions representations were addressed to the company that a greater effort should be made to get some of the money invested in Irish industries. The point of view of the company was that the Irish industries which were suitable had not turned up. The company was, as I said, unfortunate in some of its investments, and did incur losses.  But to suggest that there was any scandal or that the directors of the company exceeded their powers, or abused their trust&mdash;these are suggestions for which there is no foundation. The best people we could find were selected for the Board.  When the matter was first mooted, and when the Government was asked to invest money, we made inquiries from the promoters about the prospective directors, and as good people as could possibly be found in the city were selected.  There are directors in the company who have run big and successful businesses themselves. There are directors who are auditors and who have had experience of the biggest concerns in the country.  They are as well qualified as anybody could be.</P>
    <P>Since those losses were incurred, I have been in consultation with representatives of the Irish banks who, with the Department of Finance, are the biggest shareholders in the company. The prospects of the company have been discussed by myself, accompanied by a representative of the Irish banks, with the directors of the company.  Agreement in a general way has been reached as to the future policy of the directors of the company.  If a Government passes outside the realms of ordinary Government administration and ordinary official procedure, there is a liability to losses.  We frequently hear the Civil Service blamed for an excessive devotion to red tape.  We hear Government Departments <Col N="522" /> blamed because of their slowness in dealing with certain matters.  If an attempt were to be made to handle certain matters according to Civil Service routine, they would not be satisfactorily handled.  The difficulty of a Government Department in dealing with business is simply the difficulty of people who are not allowed to take risks or to make mistakes. If you have matters dealt with in what is called a businesslike way&mdash;according to the ordinary procedure of business firms&mdash;matters are dealt with more rapidly, but mistakes are liable to occur.  On the other hand, if mistakes occur in dealing with matters in this way, profits can be made that could not be made by a Government Department and work can be done that could not be done according to the methods of official procedure.</P>
    <P>So far as this company is concerned, considerable losses have been shown on the balance sheet.  Some of the shares which the company holds have, I am informed, improved as compared with some months ago. They are believed by those who are best qualified to judge&mdash;though nobody can tell with any certainty&mdash;to be likely to improve still further. The directors of the company with whom I discussed its position, with a representative of the banks, are confident that the majority of the holdings of the company which show depreciation will very substantially improve in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is that confidence worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will show that. If it be justified, the losses which the company have sustained might be wiped out in a very short time.  In any case, the business of the company was carried on by people as well qualified to carry it on as could be found in the country.  What they did for the company was done in perfectly good faith.  If we want business men to participate in anything with which the Government is associated there is no use in levelling charges of bad faith against them. There is no use in making attacks on them.  Any party which hopes to <Col N="523" /> undertake any public work into which business men may be brought to assist must be prepared to recognise that just as in business there are gains so there are liable to be losses.  They must recognise that if we have not the red-tape, rigid, slow-moving Civil Service procedure, we cannot avoid the occurrence of things of this nature from time to time.  If you dealt with this matter according to Civil Service procedure, then nothing would be purchased by the company but National Loan or War Loan or something of that character. When a proposal for investment in an Irish industry came up, you would have the Irish industry dealt with in the same way.  If you had that attitude adopted, there would probably be no investment in Irish industry at all.  As a matter of fact, some of the losses of the company&mdash;although by no means the majority&mdash;did occur as a result of investments in Irish industries.  Even propositions brought before the company which seemed better than others and which were rejected did involve a loss.  Looking at the matter after the event, I think the company might as well have taken some of these bad Irish propositions as some of the propositions they actually chose.  But it is easy to say that afterwards.  It is extremely easy for anybody to be wise after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can say about the matter is this: A body of competent business men, as good a body as could be found in the Saorstát acting in good faith, and giving attention to the affairs of the company, had the misfortune to have the concern sustain some losses. As a matter of fact, a great mass of these concerns did incur losses in the same period.  Even concerns which were longer established and had time to accumulate hidden reserves sustained losses which those hidden reserves were not sufficient to absorb.  I think the previous time this was raised it was raised by Deputy Flinn.  Ordinarily Deputy Flinn raises things in such a way <Col N="524" /> that I would not think worth while replying to.  I do not remember any other occasion in which it was raised in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently made rulings on certain points submitted by my Department which reduced the amount of proof that we require in regard to various applications. Up to a certain point our demands in the matter of proof were very rigid.  I have, on the recommendation of my Department, made certain rulings whereby if everything seems to be right, even although there might be a link in the chain missing, payments will be made, and it is anticipated that although the effects of these rulings have not yet been felt dispensing with some of the formalities now will very much speed up matters, and if the whole amount is not absolutely paid this year very little will remain at the end of it.  On the other hand, it was represented to me by my Department that if we insisted on the same rigidity of procedure that has prevailed up to this, it would take not a year, but two or three years. Every step has now been taken.</P>

      <P>The whole work would be thrown back.  I would not undertake to re-open that question until all applications had been disposed of.  All our hopes of speeding up the work depend on allowing applications already received to be considered. The matter can be taken up again when we see if any money remains after all the applications have been disposed of.  If new applications came in the whole thing would be held up.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £445,650 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the <Col N="527" /> Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote we propose to raise a subject to which I briefly referred in a speech on one of the Financial Resolutions&mdash; namely, the whole question of the methods adopted by the Revenue Commissioners to collect income tax, and particularly alleged arrears of income tax.  I can see Deputy T.J. O'Connell immediately becoming disturbed at the mention of the hated income taxpayer.  Well, just as members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party seem to believe that any illegality is justifiable and sanctioned, provided it be directed against the Republican element in the community, I gathered from Deputy O'Connell's speech on last Wednesday that he is of opinion that an income taxpayer is one against whom the State can do no wrong.  That is not the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connell Mr. T. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor is it our policy either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as this Party stands for justice and fair dealing between this country and its neighbours, so too we believe that within the State justice should be extended to all classes of citizens alike, and that no man, be he rich or poor, should be subjected to undue aggression or unfair measures at the hands of those who are called upon to administer the law.  When, therefore, continuous representations are <Col N="528" /> made to us that the Revenue Department of the Government in its dealings with the income taxpayer is over-riding the law, we are bound to raise and ventilate these charges in the House, and, if they are sustainable, to press them home on the Minister.</P>
      <P>In what I have to say I shall from time to time have to refer to the Revenue Commissioners, but in that connection I should like to make it clear that my remarks have no personal reference to them whatsoever. We on these benches realise, as I am sure the general body of taxpayers realise, that they are merely doing their duty and giving effect to the policy laid down for them by the Executive Council.  In this matter it is the Executive Council, through the Minister for Finance, which is the real driving force.  Whatever hardships have been inflicted, whatever wrongs have been done, it is the Executive Council which is responsible.</P>
      <P>In introducing his Budget in 1928, referring to the proposed new measures of which the country so bitterly complains to-day, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For this coming year we propose to get a substantial part of the extra income required by a resort to expedients which will give us revenue for one year only. We intend to speed up the collection of abnormal arrears of income tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the Minister has been as good as his word.  It is true that he has not used the thumb screw and the rack, favourite devices in mediæval days for extracting revenue, but, short of these physical instruments, there is no procedure to which the Minister has not had recourse, in order to secure the extra sums which he cuphemistically describes as &ldquo;abnormal arrears of income tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From inquiries which I have made, I am perfectly satisfied that large sums of money described as &ldquo;abnormal arrears&rdquo; have been in many cases nothing of the sort, have been simply blood money which <Col N="529" /> harassed and broken men have paid to escape an even more unbearable victimisation.  The Minister smiles.  It is no laughing matter for the men who have been put out of business by the Minister's Department, no laughing matter for the men who have been ruined in health, mentally and physically, no laughing matter for the country and for the industries which have suffered because of the enormous and unjustifiable sums which the Minister has extracted from them.  It would scarcely be correct, I suppose, to describe these payments as blackmail, but the methods which have been adopted to secure them are similar to the methods adopted by those who extort such unwilling tribute.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of pursuing the policy which he enunciated in 1928 I believe the Minister set up within the Department of the Revenue Commissioners a special Inquiry and Investigation Branch.  It is not certain what instructions the responsible heads of this department have received.  I doubt, indeed, whether these instructions have been committed to writing, but it may be assumed that contained in them is a general formula for the extraction of blood from a stone.  Naturally, such an arduous undertaking requires unusual methods, and it is not surprising, therefore, that in pursuing their peculiar activities the heads of this department do not hesitate to exceed altogether their powers under the law.  A favourite device of those who are engaged in collecting these abnormal arrears of income tax is to summon taxpayers to interview them in connection with cases about which there has been a dispute.  These summonses generally take the form of a letter more or less in the following terms:</P>
    <P>A personal interview is necessary with you in connection with incorrect returns of your income made by you for a number of years.  Unless you are prepared to facilitate us in securing correct details of your capital at January 1, 1914, and your profits for each year since, we shall have to institute <Col N="530" /> penalty proceedings against you.</P>
    <P>The first point to note in connection with this letter is the allegation, in some cases, at any rate, unfounded, that the recipient has made incorrect returns for a number of years.  Now the position of this special department is a peculiar one. In the letter which I have just read it is clear that the body in the position of accusers or prosecutors has laid a charge of misstatement and possibly fraud against the individual to whom the letter is addressed.  This individual is summoned to appear before them.  There is no intimation in the summons that the individual who receives it is not bound to respond to it, nor that he may take legal advice in connection with it.</P>
    <P>In 99 per cent. of the cases those who receive this summons present themselves for the interview under threat of the Special Investigation Department that they will have to institute penalty proceedings against them if they do not appear, and I am told that they are asked to give information to these men who are their accusers, and some of whom, as I will show shortly, will be their judges, which under the income tax law they are not bound to give.  I am told that in some cases questions have been asked relating to transactions dating so far back as 30 years. Questions as to the taxpayer's capital when starting business were asked; information is required as to the amount of his annual drawings, as to any gifts or settlements made to children, as to investments at various periods.  He is told that his accounts will have to be audited by an auditor whom the Department will suggest.  Information as to his various bankers and an inspection of various pass-books are demanded, and certified bank returns in many cases are asked for.  All these inquiries, I am informed, are illegal. Nevertheless they are persisted in, and as a result of them a good deal of data which the Commissioners would not otherwise secure is furnished to them and enables them to put undue pressure on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> I have mentioned that the Commissioners in their letter appear first of all in the role of accusers.  During the interview they assume the role of investigators.  We shall see later that, in due sequence, they assume the role of judges, so that the income taxpayer eventually appears before a tribunal upon which there sit, in one and the same person, not only the judge but the prosecutor and the detective.  What sort of justice has he to expect from such a court?</P>
    <P>I have said that many of the inquiries which are put at these interviews relate to information and to particulars which the Revenue Commissioners are not entitled under law to demand.  The only information which a taxpayer may be called upon to furnish is that provided for in Section 139 of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  This section reads:</P>
    <P>If the General Commissioners have received notice of appeal against an assessment made by the Additional Commissioners, or see cause to allow the objection of the surveyor to any such assessment, they shall issue a precept to the appellant ordering him to deliver to them, within the time limited by the precept, a schedule containing such particulars, for their information, as they may demand under the authority of this Act respecting&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the property of the appellant; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the trade, profession, employment or vocation carried on or exercised by him; or</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount of his profits or gains, distinguishing the particular amounts derived from each separate source; or</P>
    <P>(d)  any deductions made in arriving at his profits or gains,</P>
    <P>which particulars the said general Commissioners are hereby empowered and required to demand at their discretion whenever the same shall appear to them necessary for the purposes mentioned in this Act.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the information <Col N="532" /> to be furnished under this section is definitely limited both in form and in content.  It is to be furnished in the form of a schedule, a mere list.  There is nothing in the section empowering the Commissioners or any other person under the Act to ask for certified bank accounts, audited accounts or vouched accounts in any form, and therefore any which may be asked by the Revenue Commissioners or by their representatives, is something which they are not entitled to get, and which ought not to be given.</P>
    <P>I have said that Section 139 is the only section under which the General Commissioners&mdash;there are no General Commissioners in this country, but there are in Great Britain&mdash;were entitled to issue this precept.  The extraordinary thing, however, is that this is the one section which the Revenue Commissioners hesitate to invoke.  I think that they very rarely issue a precept. They are very glib and very emphatic about the penal sections of the statutes, and these are always kept before the minds of taxpayers, but Section 139 of the Act of 1918 is one to which they very seldom have recourse.  Why?  Because this section has been very strictly interpreted by the Courts, and the powers of the Revenue Commissioners under it have been very strictly limited.  But yet it is the law, and anything done by the Revenue Commissioners beyond it is outside the law, and should not be condoned or connived at either by the Minister, by this House, or by any Deputy, even by Deputy O'Connell. It may be that for the purposes of the Minister the powers given by the law are insufficient, but if so, his remedy is to amend the law, not to break it.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, the Minister animadverted upon my statement that the Revenue Commissioners were concealing from the taxpayer the fact that under Section 140 a person who has delivered a wrong statement as to income may rectify the same, and thereafter is <Col N="533" /> not liable to any penalty proceeding by reason of his wrong statement. The Minister attempted to justify the action of the Commissioners in trading upon the general ignorance of the taxpayer in this regard by imputing that in general the delivery of a wrong statement is due to a fraud, and therefore the generality of the taxpayers who have for one reason or another made wrong statements are excluded from the benefits of this section.  Arising out of this, it is interesting to note the general allegation of deliberate and malicious fraud which the Minister levels against the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting me.  What I said was that the section did not apply to the case of fraud, and that if a man had deliberately entered a fraudulent statement in a return, he could not be held later on to have discovered that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to the Minister that my general statement did not indicate that a person who was guilty of fraud was entitled to the benefit of the section.  My general statement was not in any sense a declaration that a person guilty of deliberate fraud was entitled to the benefit of the section.  I said the Revenue Commissioners concealed from the taxpayer the fact that under Section 140 if a man had made a wrongful return, then when he had discovered that wrongful return, either through inquiries made by the Revenue Commissioners or in any other way, provided he made a rectified return before proceedings for penalties had been taken, no penalties could be secured against him.  I made that general statement. The Minister answered it, basing his whole answer upon the case of a man who had been guilty of wilful and deliberate fraud.  He took a particular case, and applied it to the whole general body of taxpayers. If I misunderstood him, and if I am misinterpreting his attitude in that connection, I will withdraw, <Col N="534" /> and will not pursue the question of fraud any further.  I will accept the Minister's statement at once at its face value.</P>
      <P>But again, even if there were fraud, even if the Revenue Commissioners had reason to suspect fraud, that does not establish the charge of fraud.  Fraud is a question of intention, and before a charge of fraud can be brought home, the intention must be proven.  The delivery of a wrong statement may have been occasioned by something other than a deliberate intention to defraud.  Therefore, if a person is to be deprived of the benefit of Section 140&mdash;I would like to emphasise that I am advised that it is the general practice of the Revenue Commissioners to conceal from the taxpayers the benefits to which they are entitled under this Act&mdash;it can only be done where the fraud has been proved, and the mere allegation on the part of the Revenue Commissioners that the fraud has been committed is not sufficient to deprive the taxpayer of the benefits of the section.  Unless the Commissioners are satisfied to go into Court and sustain their allegation of fraud, with all that a charge of fraud involves as to intention, the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the section. I say he never gets that benefit, and I say that wherever those benefits can be withheld from him because of his ignorance of the effects of the section, the taxpayer never secures them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every case in which the Commissioners do not take proceedings the question of fraud is, at the very most, one of doubt, and surely even the present Minister for Finance will sometimes give the taxpayer the benefit of the doubt.  It will be noted that Section 139 of the Act confers certain powers on the General Commissioners in Ireland to secure information.  It happens, however, that there were never any General Commissioners in Ireland, and therefore Section 190 of the Act provided that the powers of the General Commissioners, Special Commissioners and Additional Commissioners <Col N="535" /> in England shall be exercised in Ireland by the Special Commissioners, and it is by virtue of this section that the Special Commissioners of Revenue may proceed by precept to secure the information to which I have referred in accordance with Section 139.  It may be important to point out at this stage the difference between the General Commissioners of Income Tax in England and the Special Commissioners.  The General Commissioners in England are altogether independent of the Executive.  They are an unpaid magistracy drawn from the taxpaying community.  On the other hand, the Special Commissioners are civil servants, are dependent upon the Executive, and are therefore the agents of the Executive.  The Revenue Commissioners in England stand in a position similar to the Judiciary here.  The Special Commissioners in this country are nothing of the sort.  They are not independent judges, and therefore they are not fitted to hear appeals brought by the taxpayer against themselves in many cases.</P>
    <P>The procedure of bringing appeals before the Special Commissioners in this country is as absurd and contrary to the principles of justice as would be the arraignment of a man on a criminal charge before the Attorney-General or a State Solicitor. Moreover, it is questionable whether these Special Commissioners have the power of inflicting penalties. To do that they would have to rely on Section 221 of the 1918 Act, but I do not think that that section confers the power upon them.  I do not think that since the establishment of the Free State Section 190 is any longer applicable.  Nevertheless, since the establishment of the Free State the Revenue Commissioners seem to have acted on the assumption that the Special Commismissioners have the jurisdiction to inflict penalties, with the consequence that proceedings for penalties have been prosecuted, so I am informed, before the Special Commissioners. Such proceedings are entirely criminal proceedings.  In <Col N="536" /> general, it is sought by them to inflict penalties as a punishment for fraud, though the issues are essentially issues which should be tried before the ordinary Courts.  Certainly it is clearly and manifestly unjust that people should be prosecuted before the paid officials of the prosecuting party.  What confidence could any taxpayer have in a tribunal such as the Special Commissioners when he is aware of the fact that these men have been promoted by the grace of the State and are dependent for their future promotion upon the zeal with which they carry through the policy of collecting the abnormal arrears of income tax, as laid down by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech of 1928?</P>
    <P>I say that the whole of these proceedings are in appalling conflict with all sound principles of justice and should not be for a moment countenanced or upheld.  Moreover, the action of the Special Commissioners in hearing appeals and in purporting to exercise appellate jurisdiction is a violation of Article 64 of the Constitution.  Quite clearly the hearing of appeals is a judicial function.  Article 64 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The judicial power of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall be exercised and justice administered in the public Courts established by the Oireachtas by judges appointed in manner hereinafter provided.  These Courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal to be called the Supreme Court.  The Courts of First Instance shall include a High Court, invested with full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions whether of law or fact, civil or criminal, and also Courts of local and limited jurisdiction with a right of appeal as determined by law.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that the Tribunal of the Special Commissioners is entirely excluded by the terms of this Article.  The jurisdiction which that tribunal purports to exercise is not local even though it <Col N="537" /> may be limited.  Moreover, it proceeds to determine matters and questions of law and fact, civil and criminal, a function clearly imposed in the High Court by the Article of the Constitution to which I have referred. I have mentioned the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; because fraud is surely a criminal offence.  I do not know whether the Minister proposes to advance, in justification for the present proceedings of the Special Commissioners, the excuse that Section 190 of the 1918 Act gives to them the power to hear appeals.  If so, however, such argument is nullified by Article 73 of the Constitution, which provides that those British statutes may be adapted in the Irish Free State only to the extent to which they are not inconsistent with the Constitution.  If Section 190 empowered the Special Commissioners to hear appeals it is clearly inconsistent with Article 64 of the Constitution and, therefore, is of no effect so far as Saorstát Eireann is concerned.  It is obvious that the Special Commissioners have not felt too sure of their ground in this matter. My information is that in certain proceedings in which their power to hear appeals was questioned on the grounds that they were estopped by the Constitution from doing so, the Special Commissioners dropped the matter altogether. Furthermore, they have, I understand, refused to facilitate in any way, in some cases, taxpayers who seek to secure redress in the High Courts for the unwarranted proceedings of the Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners, for instance, have refused to divulge their names.</P>
    <P>In a case which was heard in Court the other day proceedings were taken by name against two persons whose names were given in the ordinary public directory as the Revenue Commissioners. When the case came into Court, lo! and behold! the counsel for the Revenue Commissioners asked that it be dismissed on the grounds that it was wrongly constituted, as there were not two Revenue Commissioners, <Col N="538" /> but six.  The two Commissioners whose names are given to the public had become six overnight. If these functionaries can increase and multiply with this amazing fecundity, the Free State will soon be as much overrun by Revenue Commissioners as Australia only a few years ago was by rabbits.  My information further is that the counsel appearing for the Revenue Commissioners refused to divulge the name of these six mysterious beings who &ldquo;work in devious ways their wonders to perform.&rdquo;  Their names are too sacred, their persons are too august, their powers too absolute, their proceedings too arbitrary to permit their names even to be breathed in the Courts of the land.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;and I would like to repeat, that when I speak of the Revenue Commissioners in this connection, my reference is to the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council, whose instruments they are&mdash;have conceived an altogether erroneous view of their function in the collection of revenue. Their function is to collect the tax imposed by law, but to do so only by such means as are strictly in accordance with law.  It is no part of their duty to seek to increase the revenue by an unfair manipulation of the statutory provisions, no part of their duty to deal unfairly between the State and the citizen, and above all, it is certainly not their function to trade upon the reluctance or inability of individual taxpayers to incur the risks of costly litigation with the State.  To use such a leverage in order to extract moneys, which at the very best may be doubtfully due, to my mind, falls little short of blackmail. And yet, I regret to say that I am informed that it is one of the instruments which the Revenue Commissioners have employed most frequently during the past four or five years to collect these huge sums that the Minister for Finance has euphemistically referred to as &ldquo;abnormal arrears of income tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish in conclusion to guard myself <Col N="539" /> against any possible misrepresentation from the Chairman of the Labour Party, of which his speech last week was an example.  I am not asking that any taxpayer who has defrauded the State should be allowed to go free of the penalty which he has incurred, but I do ask that before a man is so penalised he shall have the benefit at least of being fairly tried before an independent tribunal.  Hitherto the luckless individual who has been so unfortunate as to be suspected even of having made a wrongful return has not had the benefit of that fair tribunal.  I hope that henceforth that will be conceded to him and that the Special Commissioners will no longer exercise appellate jurisdiction, which hitherto they have claimed, in contravention of the Constitution, and that the Revenue Commissioners will understand that it is their duty to administer the law as it stands and not as they would wish it to be.  If the law, as it now is, be ineffective for the Minister's purpose in collecting the last drops from the wine press, let him come to this House and seek to have the law amended, and if he can make a case which will be in accordance with the fundamental principles of justice and will not violate the rights of the citizen, I promise that he will have no opposition from these benches.  But let him not license the Revenue Commissioners in their illegality as his colleague the Minister for Justice has licensed the police.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>When in July last I intervened in the discussion of an Estimate similar to the one now before the House, I did so in the hope that something might be done to stop the regrettable and deplorable loss of life which was following in the direct wake of the exercise of present-day income tax methods.  I gave the House two notable examples of the largest employers of labour in my constituency, both of whom I had followed to their last resting-place as the direct result of what is now known as income tax treatment.  One at least of these <Col N="540" /> cases will be personally known to the Minister&mdash;I think he knows of both of them.  I then spoke of a third case of another large employer against whom no man had a word to say&mdash;he was a man whom nobody would ever accuse of fraud. He was at that time in danger of being subjected to a dose of income tax treatment.  I feared for his health, and I ventured to appeal to the Minister for Finance for some consideration.  I do not want to make an exaggerated or false case in any way, and I am bound to say that the appeal to the Minister was treated not merely with the courtesy which he always extends to such appeals, but, I have some reason to know, with the assistance which he is always willing to give. I appealed to the income tax officials. I said as clearly as I am saying it here: &ldquo;Spare that man's life.&rdquo;  I was turned down, and was told I was talking nonsense.  I was talking no nonsense.  On the anniversary of the death of the second victim to whom I have referred, the third victim died.  I do not know that I was ever present at a more harrowing scene than when I paid a visit of condolence not long ago to that man's widow and orphans following on his burial.  I got from them a picture of the last hours spent by that man in this world.  In these last hours when the departing soul should be left free to commune with its Maker, around that deathbed there floated the income tax fiends following that man into eternity. When I left that house I said to myself I would not care to be a Commissioner of Inland Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let nobody think for a moment that I am in the slightest degree exaggerating the facts.  I am willing to put the facts before any tribunal or any fair official, and they will be found to be exactly as I have stated.  Do you think that my interference in the debate which took place in July last caused any qualms to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or the officials?  No.  Within a few days they were hot on my trail &mdash;they were making inquiries from <Col N="541" /> my bankers, trying to ascertain the nature and ownership of cheques which had passed through my firm's account.  What object could they have save to try and bolster up a charge against me?  I care nothing for them.  When charges such as these are made, and when people actually think they can bluff a man like me, it shows the height of arrogance to which the Commissioners have raised themselves.</P>
    <P>Some time later I asked a question in this House relating to the imprisonment of two workingmen in County Cork for non-payment of income tax.  I got an answer from the Minister for Finance, and I tried to raise the question on the adjournment, but there were some Labour Deputies and some Deputies of the group with which I am associated who evidently came to the conclusion that the imprisonment of two mere workingmen was not a matter which should be raised on the adjournment, when there was down for discussion such an important question as the delivery of Belfast mud to the township of Rathmines, and accordingly, I did not get an opportunity of raising the question on the adjournment.  What were the facts of that case?  They were appalling.  Let me not misconstrue them.  I asked the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;How many persons have been imprisoned in Cork Male Prison since 1st October, 1929, for non-payment of arrears of income tax?&rdquo; and the answer I got was &ldquo;two.&rdquo;  I also asked: &ldquo;How many of those imprisoned are working tradesmen and labourers?&rdquo; and the answer I got was &ldquo;one.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;How many of the tradesmen and labourers imprisoned were, at the date of their imprisonment, unemployed?&rdquo; and the answer was &ldquo;one.&rdquo;  That is, that the only two people that they could find to throw into prison in Cork were a working artisan who had a small weekly wage, and whom everybody knew was not in any way legally liable for income tax, and a man who was unemployed at the time, and had been unemployed for one and a-half years.  I also asked: &ldquo;What provision, if any, has been <Col N="542" /> made for those dependants of the imprisoned who have, in consequence, become destitute?&rdquo; and the answer I got was: &ldquo;In cases in which proceedings in the District Courts for the recovery of tax are resorted to, the defaulters usually refuse or neglect to give information at the proper time, both as to their income and as to their family circumstances.&rdquo; When the Minister for Finance gave that information to the House. I have no doubt that he believed that he was stating what was true.  But, if he inquires into the facts, he will convince himself that the officials who gave that information were telling him what they know to be untrue and without foundation.  In one case a working tailor was living about 100 yards from the local income tax collector, who knew about his circumstances, and who, I take it, in the discharge of his duty, was asked to report on these circumstances.  They knew the man was not liable for income tax.  They knew that they were only carrying on a game of bluff. They knew they were sending him to jail not for any money legally due, but to put the fear of God into other income taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Take the second case, the circumstances of which they say they do not know.  I know something of income tax methods, and in that case I took the precaution of seeing that the Commissioners would be convicted by a written document if they dared to say, as they have said, that they did not know the facts. Before the case was heard at the District Court there was sent on behalf of the second man a statement to the Commissioners pointing out to them that he had been sued by civil bill, that the case had not yet been heard, that the man was married in July, 1925, and that he had no employment since June, 1926.  In June, 1925, this workingman, who would earn £3 or £4 per week, had been out of employment for three years all but one month, but when he was in employment in 1925 he paid sums amounting to £26 1s. 6d. in respect of arrears of income tax. <Col N="543" /> He was not an income taxpayer who was trying to commit any fraud; he was a man whom they had full notice was out of employment.  To that letter came a reply from the autocrats of Dublin Castle: &ldquo;We cannot now interfere&rdquo;&mdash;the set answer: the law must take its course.</P>
    <P>There was no mercy or shame when with full knowledge of the facts, that man was sent to jail.  Why was he sent to jail?  As a warning to people who owed arrears of income tax and who could pay them. Secondly, this is not an isolated case. Because they knew that the man had a brother-in-law, and as the collector stated at the time he was satisfied that the brother-in-law would pay in order to get rid of the shame of having a brother-in-law in jail, they got the money from the brother-in-law. That money was got as blackmail, and that money that was paid as blackmail and nothing else is still in the possession of the Inland Revenue authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has referred to the inquisition that has been set up in Dublin Castle.  I have protested against men being brought hundreds of miles up to Dublin Castle at their own expense, there to be examined as to alleged discrepancies in their accounts, the particulars of which are never given to them.  They are simply invited up for a conversation. What is the answer of the Commissioners to that?  I put it down in the form of a question.  They said: &ldquo;Ah, please, say nothing about it; you do not know the happy time that is in store for people who respond to this invitation,&rdquo; because there is a case on record in which a man came out apparently alive minus something like £1,500.  They say: &ldquo;We generously let him out minus £1,500.  We could have piled up penalties for him to about £6,000. Should not he be a thankful man?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I pass from the practice of sending unemployed and impecunious workingmen to jail, I want to make the case that, despite what the Minister for Finance said at a later period to the House, this game of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue <Col N="544" /> is carried on down to this date.  At the present moment there is in the City of Cork a workingman who was better off prior to 1922, and had then run up a bill to something like £200.  At present he is in receipt of £2 10s. per week, £1 5s. of which he has to pay for his lodging and board.  Out of the remaining £1 5s. he has to clothe himself.  It is all he has got.  A solicitor in Cork tried to keep the man out of jail and made an offer on behalf of his relatives rather than stand the shame of seeing the man go to jail for £25.  What was the answer? There is no use pretending that these methods have changed when they have not.  The answer was that they would take no such sum as £25.  The man has 5s. a week for himself after he has paid for his food and maintenance. Of course he could only pay by getting the money from his relatives through the threat of the exposure of having their relative in jail.  As the law stands they can put that man in jail, and I have no doubt they will.</P>
    <P>There was an offer made on his behalf to pay 5s. a week.  Considering that the man has barely 5s. a week after he has paid for his food and clothing he could not pay more. They refused that offer also, and that man is going to jail.  Those are some of the present income tax methods.  I prefer to give concrete instances which I can be challenged about if I am wrong and which I am prepared to prove. I respectfully submit to this House, speaking as mildly as I can&mdash;and I have always spoken moderately&mdash;there never was a more inhuman and barbarous system than the system of sending workingmen to jail purely for the purpose of frightening some taxpayers and blackmailing them.  The instances of blackmail that I have given you are not at all isolated.  I have heard Deputies in this House complain that they were told in Dublin Castle when they went to complain of a poor woman out of work being asked for a sum for income tax which she could not pay: &ldquo;Ah, has she no relatives that she could get to pay <Col N="545" /> for her?&rdquo;  In other words, is there no relative whom they cannot blackmail into paying?  I wish the Minister would consider for a moment the loss that is caused to this country by these methods.  We were all very glad to observe that the National Loan was a very distinct success, but does the Minister ever think of how much greater a success it would be were it not for this almighty threat of income tax methods which are prevailing almost in every house in this country?  I tell him, speaking for one district&mdash; where, I am sorry to say, the contributions were very small&mdash;that the reason they were small was because the inhabitants had the fear of the income tax official to such an extent that they would not subscribe to the National Loan, fearful of the raids that the income tax authorities would make on them; in fact, that they would have to explain not merely where every penny of it came from but what they had for breakfast and dinner every day since the 1st January, 1914.</P>
    <P>I asked another question, and I only mention it now to illustrate what I have said already, that the Minister cannot accept the statements which he gets from the officials of the Inland Revenue as being true. I am stating nothing that I cannot prove by means of a written document. It has reference to a sitting of the Special Commissioners which took place in Skibbereen some time last year.  I asked him if he was aware that a number of taxpayers in West Cork who had appealed against their assessments of income tax received notice from the inspector of taxes that their appeals would be heard in Skibbereen on 7th November, 1929, but when they arrived they found they were not heard.  I asked what would be done to make compensation to these men or, at all events, to apologise to them for what had occurred.  I was told that it had occurred in one case.  The official who made that return told a deliberate lie.  He knew that I knew of one case, and he believed that I knew of one case only, but I did know of at least one other case in which a man <Col N="546" /> who had been brought a very long distance and to whom the official kindly gave the go-by when he was making a false case for the Minister to present to this House.  In that case the man, after coming a long distance at great personal inconvenience to attend on a summons on a certain date, was told by the inspector in my own presence: &ldquo;Go away out of that, you are not wanted here to-day.&rdquo;  One would think it would do no harm to the autocrats of Dublin Castle if they instructed their officials down the country to treat the taxpayers with something like common courtesy and common civility.</P>
    <P>I will give one other instance of what they do and which, I am sorry to say, is a daily occurrence.  I have been attending the sittings of the Special Commissioners' courts for close on 40 years.  In the old days I never saw a priest or other clergyman there.  Nowadays if you attend a sitting of the Special Commissioners it is not an infrequent sight to see a queue of priests going in whose explanations would not be accepted by the inspector of taxes.  Why are they brought there?  They are brought there, in pursuance of the policy of bluff, to demonstrate to the public that the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are no respecters of persons.  While they tell you on the one hand that they do not care a damn about the Minister for Finance they will tell you on the other hand that they do not care a damn about the priests.  As a non-Catholic, I dislike drawing attention to this, but whatever was said about the old officials they were not priest hunters.  These clergymen receive money by way of offerings and part with it as charity, a charity which in many instances has come personally before my notice and which would bring a blush of jealousy to a Carnegie. I would suggest that their explanations might be reasonably taken and that they should not be put to the expense, inconvenience and unpleasantness of being dragged into a Special Commissioners' court. The Revenue Commissioners would get the same in one instance as in the <Col N="547" /> other.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he would be well advised and that it would be in the best interests of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="548" /> if he announced to them that priest-hunting must cease.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday.</P>
