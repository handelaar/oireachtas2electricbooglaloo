      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to a statement made in the British House of Commons by the Secretary of State for India to the effect that the British Government had approached the Government of India &ldquo;as they would the Government of any Dominion,&rdquo; and put before them the injuries that an increased tariff on cotton by India would inflict on British manufacturers, and whether he could say if the British Government had at any time made any representations to the Free State Government with regard to the effect on British industry of tariffs imposed by the Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>These fishermen exercised no private right <Col N="550" /> of fishing in the Shannon and no claim for compensation can arise out of the cesser of any facility which was formerly at the disposal of any member of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these people, or the people who preceded them for fifty years, have had these rights, and is he going to deny them these rights and refuse them the right to live, because the Shannon scheme is in operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to use the fisheries there is the same as the right to use the public road, no more and no less.  I cannot undertake to compensate people for the cesser of a right which is open to every member of the public.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister know that the management of these boats is a very technical matter, much more difficult than walking on a road, and that those who come to fish there are guided by these fishermen, who know every current and breeze and variation of the water, and is he going to deny these thirty or forty men the right to live because the Shannon scheme is a work of public utility?</P>

      <P>That is a different question.  All that I am asked is will I take the necessary steps to compel the Company to meet representatives of the men's trade union to discuss the matters in dispute.  If the Deputy says that he and the rest of the Labour Party want a system of compulsory arbitration in regard to disputes brought in I shall consider that, but in relation to a single dispute, that we should have the enforcement of certain people even to meet certain other people, I cannot consider.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will state the cost to his Department to date of supplying Gárda Síochána escorts to the omnibuses owned by the Irish Omnibus Company as a result of the dispute which has arisen between that Company and its employees; <Col N="552" /> and whether, in view of the continued refusal of the Company to discuss the matter in dispuite with representatives of the men's trade union, he will consider the withdrawal of the escorts or alternatively require the Company to pay the cost of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Police escorts are provided for omnibuses owned by the Irish Omnibus Company Ltd., where such escorts are believed to be necessary for the prevention of damage to the vehicles and for the protection of passengers.  This work is part of the general work of the police and it is fallacious to suggest, as the Deputy suggests in his question, that any part of the cost of the police force should be earmarked for such work.  I do not appreciate the suggestion in the latter part of the Deputy's question that the Minister for Justice should interfere in a dispute of this kind by refusing to grant protection to property and person where he is advised that such protection is desirable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if in the Marrowbone Lane Housing Scheme, for which tenders are now invited by the Dublin City Commissioners, Irish slates are to be used; and, if not, will he see that the tenders are amended, so that Irish slates will be specified.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="553" /> possibility of the use of Irish slates has formed the subject of correspondence between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Dublin Corporation, and I understand the City Commissioners propose on receipt of the tenders which have been invited for the Marrowbone Lane housing scheme to ask for quotations for the roofing of the houses (a) with Irish slates and (b) with Irish concrete tiles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he is prepared to remit the amounts proposed to be added as compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money of the holdings of John Campion, James Hayes, John Hogan, Stephen Walsh, Michael Lanigan, William Lanigan and William Lahert, tenants on the estate of Lady Frances Poe, in view of the fact that a fair purchase price which ensures a favourable return to the landlord has already been fixed upon these tenants, and that they have been paying excessive amounts as payment in lieu of rent for the past six years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. Roddy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have no power to remit the amounts which have been added to the standard price in these cases in respect of compounded arrears of rent.  The cases of the tenants referred to by the Deputy are no different from those of tenants generally who held their lands at judicial rents and who have in fact benefited, first, by the reduction of 25 per cent. off rents in arrear provided for in the 1923 Act, and secondly, by the statutory arrangement by which the arrears so reduced and compounded were added to the standard price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. Fogarty Mr. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that these tenants are paying an excessive amount in lieu of rent for the past six years, does the Parliamentary Secretary think it is either <Col N="554" /> just or fair to ask them to pay the compounded arrears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly just.  The tenants were notified of the compounded arrears that they would have to pay and they were given time to object, and they did not object.  In any event, these provisions are in the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927 and we are acting literally in accordance with the provisions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

With regard to No. 3, if, in fact, the Minister has no power to compel the company to meet the representatives of the men's trade union, what will be discussed on the adjournment?

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss an industrial dispute.  It is <Col N="556" /> relevant by way of Parliamentary question, because the Minister does on occasions act as arbitrator through certain of his officials. Clearly a dispute is not for discussion in the House because an arbitrator, of course, cannot argue the merits.  I prefer, therefore, Deputy Hogan's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not the terms of the question.  The question asked the Minister to take steps to compel the Company to meet representatives of the men.  A trade dispute question is a common question and, as I say, it is relevant because of the Minister's functions as arbitrator, but because these are the functions of the Minister it is undesirable and it is cutting across the Minister's functions to discuss the merits of the dispute here, or to ask the Minister to express a view on the merits of the dispute.  Since that cannot be done it is difficult to see what can be done under the terms of this notice.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with this Bill section by section.  The first section is self-explanatory, it simply defines that the expression &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Electricity Supply Act 1927 and, according to the Act of 1929, the meaning that is given to it here.  The second section includes the expansion of the term &ldquo;local authority.&rdquo;  The usual definition of local authority will be extended to include such bodies as the Commissioners of Merrion Square.  They will be given power to levy a rate on the Electricity Supply Board in regard to premises within the jurisdiction of those Commissioners. There is nothing more in it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third section gives me power and gives me power retrospectively, to execute certain works instead of paying compensation.  It is necessary to have this retrospective in order to clear up certain doubts which arise under Section 3 (1) subhead M. of the Act of 1925.  There is some doubt in that section as to whether or not the execution of the works that are referred to in this paragraph would be within my power. In order to clear up that doubt we are making this retrospective.  The purpose of the section is to enable me instead of paying compensation to certain people to execute works for them to the amount of such compensation, it being presumed that having certain contractors under my control I will be in a position to get the work done more cheaply than if outsiders were brought in.  Sub-section (5) ordains that with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health the exemption from rates which was given under Section 96 of the 1927 Act shall also be applicable to such minor works&mdash;and they will be very minor &mdash;as I may take in hands under this section.  It is simply to meet the position that if in carrying out the main works it is found that certain incidental works like embankments, <Col N="559" /> the provision of water supplies, and the raising of certain docks in Lough Derg, can better be done under my authority with my contractors than outsiders could possibly hope to do these, in order to save them the cost of carrying out these works I ask to be entitled under this Bill to carry out these works within the terms of the compensation which would afterwards have to be paid.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is aimed at a particular bargain which has been made by the Electricity Supply Board in relation to the Cork Electricity Company. That is the only thing which we see coming within the scope of this paragraph at the moment.  It is to be noted that the new section does not increase the total advances to be made to the Board but the amount which may be advanced in any half year is enlarged, all the while within the control of the Minister for Finance.  Deputies will realise that under the old Act a sum of £400,000 in any half year was the limit that might be advanced by the Minister for Finance.  If the purchase of an undertaking involves a sum of more than £400,000, and if the bargain made necessitates the payment of more than £400,000 in one sum the Board would find it impossible to carry out the bargain. Such a situation has arisen and it is therefore necessary to enable the Minister for Finance to advance more than £400,000 in a particular half year.  The overriding limit of two and a half millions still remains.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 deal with the same point.  Up to date when an advance is being made by the Minister for Finance to the Board the rate of interest for purposes of repayment has under the Act to be calculated at the time of the advance.  The particular difficulty in which the Minister for Finance finds himself might have been met by so adjusting the interest on the repayments to later advances, as to equalise over charges that might have been made on early advances. In that way the Minister for Finance could adjust the rate at which interest is payable, but the Minister <Col N="560" /> could only adjust it at the time of the last advance.  It is only fair that the Board should be allowed to borrow from the State at the rate at which the State can borrow from the community, plus the charges of securing the accommodation that has been given.  The Minister for Finance is again the judge of the rate.  This is only to enable him to vary the rate, and to secure that it is not necessary for him to establish the rate at the time of the advance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with this same point, but having effect more to time relation than to interest charge. Up to date the obligation was that repayments should be made within a period of six months after the Board becomes liable for a repayment. This gives the Minister for Finance&mdash;it is still within the Minister for Finance's control&mdash;a discretion as to the time subsequent to the transfer of the Shannon works to the Board.  It will be realised by Deputies, as there are certain claims outstanding and likely to be outstanding for a long time in relation to land that is being taken for the canal and for the poles, that it may not be possible within a period of six months after the works are handed over to the Board to determine what is the exact liability that falls upon the Board.  Hence we want to get rid of this six months' period. It gives a discretion to the Minister for Finance to determine the liability after six months or such longer period as he shall in the particular case direct.</P>
    <P>Section 8 carries practically the same definition as is given to a local authority under sub-section (2) of Section 96 of the Act of 1927.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 must be taken together.  The net result of Sections 9, 10 and 11 is that while confirming the old exemption from ratesgranted by Section 96 of the Act of 1927, it puts clearly upon the Board liability to pay rates on everything else, but it stereotypes the valuation on which rates are to be paid, as that valuation was at particular dates.  Section 9 is similar to the terms of the Financial Resolution moved yesterday <Col N="561" /> in relation to income tax.  It declares and enacts that the two reasons which might have operated to exempt the Board from payment of rates do not hold in relation to the Board's property.  So far as Section 9 by itself goes it means that the Board is to be liable for rates and has been liable for rates as if there never was any question of the Board's occupation being occupation by the State or a department of State, or occupation of a public nature or for a public purpose, these being the two reasons which would have been relied on to secure the Board against liability to rates.</P>

      <P>All rates, as far as Section 9 is concerned.  Section 10 moves forward another step. Section 10 says in regard to acquired undertakings the position ought to be stereotyped in this way, that local authorities which have up to this looked to the receipt of rates from certain property ought to be able to rely on the receipt of the same amount of rates, or rather ought to be able to rely on the rates that will come from the same valuation as heretofore.  But in order to prevent an increase of valuations of a penal type as between, say, the introduction of this Act and the vesting order passed by the Board paragraph B establishes that where the vesting order or conveyance is made after the passing of this Act the valuation shall be the valuation in force for the year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1929.</P>
      <P>Where the vesting order is made before the passing of the Act the valuation on which rates are based is stereotyped for all time as the valuation which was in force at the date of the vesting order, and where the vesting order which takes over an undertaking is dated after the passing of the Act the valuation on which the rates will be payable is declared to be the valuation in force for the year beginning on 1st April, 1929.</P>

The valuation is stereotyped, and stereotyped against the Board for all time, even though the Board goes out of possession of the property. Let me give a case in point. If the Board decided, for instance, not to use the Dublin station but to build a station of its own, it will continue to pay rates on the Dublin station until this legislation is changed, and the valuation will be the same as that in force on the date at which the Board took over the station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were, and that will be continued.  The difficulty from the Board's point of view is that these proposals are based on valuation which have been greatly increased since the Shannon scheme was talked of.  Sections 9, 10 and 11 carry out what was previously declared when the 1927 Bill was going through. It was declared that we sought to exempt the new Shannon works, which were not previously rated. They were to be exempted, but it was hinted, and declared in letters to the Board, that they were supposed to be <Col N="564" /> liable for, and it was our intention that they should be liable for rates. We are now enforcing these payments on them.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 and 13 deal with compensation to employees.  Our desire is to rectify two deficiencies found in the previous Act.  Section 12 means that under the Principal Act of 1927 compensation was only payable where the Board had issued a formal order on the closing of a generating station. The scheme of that Act was that the Board would close down a generating station either by order or by taking possession of the station. If they took possession of the undertaking, it was our belief and our intention that the Board would become an authorised undertaker, and would be liable to all the obligations of such an authorised undertaker and also that peculiar responsibilities would flow from that. There is a legal doubt as to that situation, and we want to make it clear.  We want to declare that whether the Board issues a formal order or not, the compensation set out in the Schedule of the Act of 1927 shall apply to employees of such generating stations.  The net effect is to dispense with the necessity of a formal order before compensation can be claimed.</P>

      <P>The previous Act and this Bill only deal with compensation to those engaged in generation. The only field of employment that has been narrowed and restricted by the Shannon scheme is that concerned with generation.  A bigger field has been created for those engaged in the distribution end.  The line we take is that for people engaged in generating stations compensation should be available.  Those who have been employed otherwise have had a bigger field of employment opened up to them, and if they are worth anything they will be employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>By no means.  It never was permanent.  Their chances of what amounts to permanent <Col N="566" /> employment under the Board are greater than the chances of anybody else who may seek work under the Board.  Why should we compensate that class of person?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we give him a greater field of opportunity.  I do not consider that a man who was never permanent should be regarded as a permanent man.  We are not destroying opportunity of occupation, but rather are we giving greater scope for a certain type of individual. Why should we compensate that individual?</P>
      <P>Section 13 deals with compensation under a different heading.  Previously the law was that where an undertaking had not been acquired, but where a generating station was closed because the employer was going to take his supply of electricity in bulk from the Shannon, the employees were not eligible for compensation because no formal closing order had been issued by the Board.  Under the old legislation the right to compensation depended on the formal closing order issued by the Board.  This section dispenses with the necessity of such order before compensation begins to accrue to such people.  If those who are employed in a generating station lose their employment because the people who own the station are not compulsorily closed by the Board, but who closed themselves because they are going to take supplies in bulk, we ordain that compensation shall flow to their employees, just as we previously ordained that it should come to those who were put out of employment because the Board issued a formal order.  The net result is that where previously a formal vesting order was a condition precedent to compensation it is now no longer a condition precedent.  If the undertaking itself closes down, the closing down being due to the taking of a supply in bulk from the Board, then the ordinary compensation terms apply.</P>

      <P>We are expected to give a Second Reading to this Bill to-day, although it was only circulated yesterday.  It is a Bill the full significance of which cannot be grasped by reading it over once.  It is a bad example of the type of legislation to which Opposition Parties always object&mdash;that is, legislation by reference.  The various sections composing this Bill have been under consideration by the Minister and by the Executive Council for some time, as was indicated by statements made here.  Deputies, however, have only known of the contents of the Bill since yesterday.  On such short notice, they cannot be expected to give a considered opinion concerning the proposals contained in it. There is this to be said in favour of giving the Bill a Second Reading to-day&mdash;that, in fact, it contains no principle, each section being distinct in itself.  We can discuss the sections in detail on the Committee Stage.  There is also a certain amount of urgency in regard to the sections relating to the compensation <Col N="568" /> of employees.  We do not intend to hold up the Bill in any way.  We shall content ourselves with getting from the Minister the information necessary to make the provisions of the Bill clear to us.  So far as the Bill requires discussion, we can discuss it section by section on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There are some points on which I desire to obtain further information. My first point is in relation to Section 3.  We have always objected, and will object, to retrospective legislation of this kind. This is a section which is unobjectionable in itself but which proposes to declare that a certain thing was, when, in fact, it was not, in effect from the 4th July, 1925.  Has the Minister embarked since 1925 upon any construction schemes such as are indicated in the section?  If so, how and in what manner did the legality of his actions come to be questioned?  Presumably, such construction schemes have been embarked upon.  Otherwise, this retrospective clause would not be necessary. If it has happened that the Minister exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the Act of 1925, did he do so knowing that he was exceeding his powers or was he under the impression that the Act of 1925 was not so water-tight as he has since discovered it to be?  We have had a number of Bills and motions before the Dáil from time to time to ratify mistakes in legislation for which the Government was responsible.  Ministers are generally very eloquent in their sarcasm regarding Bills introduced by members of the Opposition Party.  But no Bill introduced by any member of any Opposition Party in this House has had to be so drastically amended as some of the Bills which the Minister himself prepared with the assistance of a hundred officials in his Department and the entire staff of the draftsman's office.  This is a Bill of that rectifying type. Practically every section in it is designed to remove doubts which were created by the faulty drafting of the original Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> Section 4 is designed, as the Minister has informed us, to meet the special circumstances concerning the acquisition of the Cork Electricity Supply Company but, as the Minister pointed out, it has a wider application than that.  If it is merely intended that the Electricity Supply Board should exceed the limitations of the Act of 1927 in respect of the acquisition of the Cork Electricity Supply Company, why is the section not confined to that one case instead of being made applicable to any case that may arise?  There is, I notice, in relation to this section a retrospective sub-section also declaring that the section shall have and be deemed always to have had effect as from the 1st day of January, 1930.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 are designed to enable the Minister for Finance to vary the rate of interest charged to the Board on advances from the Central Fund.  The Minister enunciated a principle with which it is very hard to disagree.  That is, that the Board should be able to borrow from the State at a rate similar to that at which the State borrows from the public.  That principle seems to be applied only in the case of the Electricity Supply Board.  It has not been applied to the case of local authorities endeavouring to borrow money for housing schemes through the Local Loans Fund.  Is it intended that the rate of interest to be charged the Board will be sufficiently high to recoup the State all the expenditure in which the State was involved in the raising of that money. or is it merely intended that the rate of interest shall be the same, say, as the rate of interest on the National Loan, irrespective of flotation and other charges?</P>
    <P>The Minister explained at considerable length the effect of the sections dealing with the collection of rates on property controlled or owned by the Electricity Supply Board.  He undoubtedly made that clear to Deputies, but he did not give us any clear explanation as to why it is necessary to have the stereotyping of the valuation of acquired property, and he did not state what particular advantage will be gained <Col N="570" /> by the Board or the local authorities as a result of the stereotyping of the valuation.  It may be that there is a good case for it, but the Minister has not made the case, and I should be glad if he would do so in replying.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to agree with the Minister's remarks concerning the compensation of clerical officers and other persons of that class engaged at generating stations.  The Minister appears to believe that in giving these persons an opportunity of employment he is, in fact, compensating them for the loss of employment. I do not think that a person who has had experience of being unemployed would consider that fair compensation.  Whatever the legal position of clerical officers of the Dublin generating station may have been, in fact they were permanent officials of the Dublin Corporation and were so regarded by all concerned.  Officials of the Dublin Corporation who passed a qualifying examination were for all purposes regarded as permanent employees except that they were liable to dismissal for neglect of duty or dishonourable conduct.  Their positions were, in fact, as permanent as those of civil servants, and to argue that no harm is done to that class when permanent, pensionable employment is taken from them is sheer nonsense. It may be true&mdash;in fact, it probably is true&mdash;that the majority of them can secure alternative employment without much trouble under the Electricity Supply Board.  But if there is even one such official who has had his permanent, pensionable employment taken from him as a result of State action, then the State should provide that employee with compensation sufficient to keep him from hardship until he has had an opportunity of adapting himself to the changed circumstances and until he has got employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Minister has introduced sections to provide compensation for the technical staff engaged in the Dublin station and similar stations.  As Deputies are aware, considerable hardship has been occasioned because of the fact <Col N="571" /> that these employees were rendered idle when the station was closed down, following the bringing of Shannon current to Dublin.  In fact, all we have to say concerning these sections of the Bill is to express our regret that they have been delayed so long.  We do not think it was necessary to wait until the other sections of the Bill, dealing with the rating of the premises and the alteration of the financial provisions of the original Act, were ready.  A short Bill containing these two sections could have been introduced at least a month ago.  If that had been done, as we urged at the time, considerable hardship would have been avoided. We think that even as the Bill is now, it will be necessary on Committee Stage to urge the Dáil to extend these sections.  We shall, however, wait before coming to a decision until we have had an opportunity of examining the Bill and discussing it amongst ourselves, in conjunction with the Minister's statement in introducing it, and his statement in reply to the queries we have raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that sub-section (2) of Section 9 of this Bill maintains the position in relation to rates on the Shannon works.  We may have some proposal to make to the Dáil in relation to that matter when we shall have had an opportunity of discussing the question amongst ourselves.  It has been stated that considerable injustice has been done to the Clare County Council by reason of the fact that additional burdens have been placed upon it in consequence of the erection of the works, for which no additional revenue has been made available. However, whether or not we will take the opportunity which the introduction of this Bill gives us to ask the Dáil to reconsider its original decision, is a matter which will be determined between this and the next stage.  I should like if the Minister would deal with the points I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would explain <Col N="572" /> to some further extent, when replying, the provisions of clause 12.  A good deal of discussion has been going on recently regarding the position of the employees at the Pigeon House Fort station.  It comprises men who are known as station men, as well as distributors.  Members of both these classes have various periods of service and are entitled to pensions under the Corporation. The closing down of the works means that they would be deprived of that pension, and I should like to know whether it is proposed to compensate them in that regard, taking into account their years of service.  I should like to know also if those who are temporary hands are to be in any way compensated by way of gratuity or otherwise, or what years are to be fixed for the granting of compensation under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): When the Minister for Industry and Commerce came before the Dáil some six years ago with a proposition for the development of Shannon power, some of us considered that it was a courageous gesture towards national development.  We are still of that opinion.  We still believe it is something which will materially benefit the nation.  When the nation was asked to spend about six million pounds we naturally expected that those people who were likely to lose as a result of the operations of the Shannon scheme would get consideration, in view of the fact that the scheme was designed for the benefit of the nation.  Situated as we are in Clare beside the start and end of the development we concluded that Clare would not be in any worse position with reference to that construction, and yet we do find that the Minister has imposed a good deal of hardship not alone on the administrative county of Clare and the people concerned for the upkeep of all the institutions in that county, but he also has ignored the claims of a certain section of the community in that county in the matter of having their employment <Col N="573" /> destroyed because of the operations of the Shannon scheme.  We find that the Minister is making something like an act of repentance in connection with further buildings, offices or constructions that may be made under the Electricity Board. We find there some gesture of repentance in this attitude of his in introducing this Bill.  These buildings are going to be subject to rates of the local authorities, and yet we do not find that he extends that same gesture of repentance to the ratepayers of the County Clare who are getting no extra advantage from the presence of all the works that are in their administrative county in connection with the Shannon scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot be unaware that the people who are responsible for the administration of that county feel that an injustice is being done them because representations have been made to his Department on several occasions on this matter and expressions of opinion from public authorities have reached him.  One would have thought when he got this opportunity of including these buildings and works which must have a very high valuation in the county that he would make some attempt to relieve that hardship. He has not done it and as far as I can gather he does not intend to do it.  Deputy Lemass has indicated that probably they will take some action in the matter and I can only hope that we will have the influence of the Fianna Fáil Party in trying to remove that grievance.  There is another matter in connection with land submerged in this district. There are still some people seeking compensation, some twenty or thirty cases still undecided, and to which I have made reference here on several occasions.  Surely the Minister at this stage ought to have closed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pass to one of the principal faults I have to find with the operations of the Shannon scheme, the failure of the Minister to make provision for those whose employment has been destroyed because of these operations.  I refer to the fishermen in Killaloe.  The Minister <Col N="574" /> said a few moments ago&mdash;I am quoting his exact words&mdash;that compensation should be paid where a field of employment is narrowed or restricted.  That surely is a perfectly clear statement and surely the field of employment for these fishermen in Killaloe because of the operation of the Shannon scheme is not alone narrowed and restricted but entirely destroyed.  The trout and salmon fisheries on the Shannon, I presume to say, are world famous. There are two divisions of them, those which are privately owned&mdash; and these include by far the greater part of these fisheries&mdash;and those which are free to the public.  The Minister spoke this morning about the necessity of compensating people who would even walk the road, if he extended compensation to these people. To fish the Killaloe waters a special kind of boat called a cot is required. These cots are long and flat bottomed; tapering at both ends and some of them run to 28 feet in length.  They are difficult to manage and it takes long and arduous apprenticeship to acquire the skill and dexterity necessary to manipuate these craft in the tumbling, racing, rock-strewn, Shannon at Killaloe.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy taking this opportunity instead of the adjournment to raise this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I raise it now I will not raise it on the adjournment.  I will leave the Minister off earlier.  I hope he will appreciate that fact in dealing with it.  Consequently the cot fishermen, who fish with rod and line only, are not many, and the art and practice of cot fishing has remained mostly in the hands of the same families for generations.  These men have grown up, one might say, in the Shannon.  They are certainly as familiar with its currents and pools and variations as are the sea islanders with their coral reefs. Fishing is their, livelihood.  They talk fish, eat fish know how every cloud, shade or wind that blows affects their second mother&mdash;the <Col N="575" /> Shannon.  They have been acknowledged by experts as the most skilled rod and line fishers in the whole world; and it is well known to followers of Izaak Walton that the Killaloe gaff man is without an equal when it comes to gaffing a hooked salmon.  Those men view with dismay their position when the Shannon scheme will be completed; for then the fisheries at Killaloe will be wiped out and their occupation will indeed be gone.</P>
      <P>I would put to the Minister the position that he has compensated other people who were concerned with the fishing industry on the Shannon.  He has given the riparian owners a certain amount of compensation for what he considers their interests or trade losses, and now this morning he stated he would not compensate these fishermen because they were not entitled to compensation. He said they had no more claim than the people who walked the road.  I want to put it to the Minister that the Shannon to these men was as the parts of their land were to the people who have been compensated when these lands were submerged.  It is their only means of livelihood.  For generations past their fathers and forefathers have been fishing on the Shannon.  They are peculiarly adapted to that kind of work and no other kind of work.  Therefore, from the Minister's statement a few minutes ago that compensation should be paid where the field of employment is narrowed or restricted, he should certainly consider the claims of these people.  I put these points to him, and also I put it that he should consider the position of the Clare ratepayers when leaving all the entire Shannon work out of that county.  I ask him to consider these matters sympathetically between now and the Committee Stage to avoid further discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephByrne" hpid="Mr. J.J. Byrne Mr. J.J. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass has stated, this is a difficult Bill, because it is legislation by reference, but there is one thing that emerges from this Bill for which I think the Minister should be congratulated, <Col N="576" /> and that is, it clarifies the whole issue as far as payment of rates to local authorities is concerned, and also in another important item as far as compensation to redundant men is concerned.  These were two injustices which, in the opinion of most people conversant with the Bill, called for a speedy and effective remedy, and I think the Minister has given the remedies most people expected he would give. The failure of the former Acts to enable payment of rates to local authorities was felt in Dublin as a very distinct grievance.  I am very glad to see that the Minister has now removed that grievance for all time.  His statement on that head is perfectly definite and precise, that local authorities will get for all time the rates they have been accustomed to receive.  I presume they will get them at the higher valuation, and there will be no fault with that.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Doyle in referring to the men employed at the Pigeon House Fort. Some of these men have had service ranging from thirty to forty years. The Minister stated in the course of his remarks that employment under a new scheme should rather be increased than diminished.  But with regard to men of that age, in my opinion, a Board like the Shannon Board would be rather chary about taking them on.  I would like to ask the Minister if these men will receive fresh employment under the Electricity Supply Board, how they will stand with regard to their pension rights, which have accrued for thirty or forty years, in the service. I think if these men are transferred into the employment of the Board that the Board should be liable for any pension rights that have accrued owing to the past services of these men.  I hope the Minister will give that careful consideration when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another point with regard to these men.  Many of them are employed in what they consider a temporary capacity.  They are working for the new board, but they do not know when their employment <Col N="577" /> may cease.  They may be knocked off in a week or in a month.  They do not know what the nature of their employment at the moment is.  I would ask the Minister to endeavour to see that the Board makes some permanent arrangement for these men, either takes them on as permanent employees, or let them know exactly in what capacity they stand before they arrange to become servants of the new Board.  I think the first question which should be resolved, as far as they are concerned, is: Do they lose their pensions, or is the new Board liable for these pension rights?  I hope the Minister will deal with this sympathetically.  Also, as representing the City of Dublin, I hope the Minister will not pay any attention to the eloquent plea of Deputy Hogan from Clare.  Since I came into this House I have noticed that the country is always pulling the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told it is the other way about, but my experience is the reverse.  Deputy Hogan is proof of that.  He has pleaded eloquently for the ratepayers and for the Killaloe fishermen.  I think the ratepayers of Dublin are in a different position from these people. They made more sacrifices, as far as the Shannon scheme is concerned, than the Killaloe fishermen, although I do not want to say anything detrimental to anyone who is earning his livelihood in that way.  I would remind Deputy Hogan that when the Dublin jarveys were superseded there was no one to give them compensation.  It was a hardship, but at the same time the ordinary ups and downs must be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that there is some clarification, at least in one section of what is, I think, the most obscure Act, with the possible exception of the British Employers Liability Act, that was ever produced.  I am not saying that in any very critical spirit, because I <Col N="578" /> recognise that when that Act was introduced a good many things were uncertain, and a good many changes were made in the actual process of passing that Act which were not, in fact, properly co-ordinated and which, possibly, could not be co-ordinated. But where we have a Bill of this kind to remove doubts, it ought to be recognised that these are not by any means the only doubts which will eventually have to be removed.  I know I spent a very considerable time reading the two Acts and reading the debates on which they were formed, and time after time I came up against things which I certainly, as an ordinary man with the ordinary capacity to read these Bills, could not get a solution of, nor when I went to experts for advice could I get clear information as to what was meant. Certain clauses I read with amazement, and I looked further along for what might be called compensating clauses, or things of that kind, but I did not find them. I found quite a number of things which I will tell you quite frankly I have not up to the present been able to understand, nor do I believe do the Electricity Supply Board themselves understand them.  I will take one example before I pass on to the general things, and that is a very fundamental financial point in the Bill: What is a transformer area and what are the obligations in the way of accounting in relation to transformer areas?  I have not been able to ascertain what is any particular transformer area in Ireland at the present moment, nor have I been able to ascertain, nor do I think it is known to those responsible, what is the meaning of the regulation that says that line ball accounts shall be produced; in other words, that at a certain date a charge shall be made for the electricity which will cover, and not more than cover, the commitments, nor how this regulation applies to the separate transformer areas.  We are told in the Bill that the cost of one transformer area shall not be charged up to another&mdash;I am putting it now in rough language&mdash;but <Col N="579" /> we do not know what those transformer areas are, nor do we know whether separate line ball accounts will have to be produced for that purpose under the existing Act.</P>
      <P>Why I am raising this particular point is that those doubts are acknowledged in the Bill.  No one is looking to hold up or to interfere in any way with the passage of the Bill, but those doubts do need to be removed.  It looks almost as if the Act would have to be removed in order to remove the doubts.  But the sooner the Minister does tackle the fundamental doubts of that Act generally the better.  I think that they ought not to be tackled by the method of declaring that what in fact is, is not.  Here you had a corporation whose constitution is in doubt set up to administer one of the largest financial enterprises in this State, and a financial enterprise which will increase in size.  Whatever money we have voted up to the present for the Shannon scheme will not be the limit.  I have no doubt whatever that an increasing amount year by year will have to be voted, and I am not in any way complaining of it.</P>
      <P>There is a clause in the Bill which, in my opinion, nullifies a good deal of what is in the Bill.  Under the resolution which we passed yesterday we made the Electricity Supply Board, which was not up to this liable for income tax, liable to income tax, and under this Bill we make the Electricity Supply Board which up to now was not liable for rates, liable to rates.  Both of these charges will have to be added to the price of electricity.  Those are definite calls and commitments upon that Board, and yet Section 5 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may from time to time vary the rate at which interest payable under this section is to be paid.&rdquo;  There is a clear authority, as far as I under it, to give with one hand, if any particular Minister for Finance chooses or if the policy of a particular Minister requires it, what is <Col N="580" /> taken away with the other.  Personally I think that that clause nullifies effectively any real strength that there is in the other two clauses.</P>
    <P>As to the question of rates I have a very open mind, because I go on the principle that all these charges have to be put on to the goods.  For instance, if the electricity-consuming population of Dublin was coextensive with the ratepayers it would be a matter of complete indifference whether you put rates on the Electricity Supply Board or not. To the extent to which the consumers of electricity become coextensive with the population the argument for putting a specific charge upon electricity in the form of rates weakens.  Similarly, the extent to which the total population of the country come to consume electricity, and I hope they will, weakens the argument for putting a specific charge on to the price of electricity for income tax.  So that, in my opinion, there is no very great principle involved in that case. The popular and the big argument, the argument which, of course, appealed very much so far as rates were concerned, was upon the very much smaller element&mdash;such things as the offices that the Board has in Mount Street and the administration and sale rooms they have in Stephen's Green.  Everybody can see that there seems to be some relative injustice in their immunity from rates.  But in my personal opinion there is no difference in principle between their immunity from rates there and their immunity from rates in the stations themselves. Under this Bill, the rateable value is stereotyped.  I am not at all as sure that in so doing they are acting fairly to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>I look at it in this way: The Electricity Supply Board was set up to be, as nearly as possible, an independent corporation and organisation for the purpose of carrying on the business of electrification, and the more extremely that policy of keeping it separate and independent is carried out the more I personally <Col N="581" /> approve of it and the more hope I have of its success.  That Board was handed over a certain responsibility under a certain charter, which was the Act of 1927.  Here we are deliberately taking out of the possession of the Board&mdash;a so-called separate organisation with that responsibility&mdash;certain immunities which were given to it under the Act.  For instance, if the Shannon scheme had been sold, as it is suggested it might have been sold, to some separate company, it would have been sold under that charter, with the powers contained in that charter and with the responsibilities of that charter. It is a matter for consideration whether, when we are altering that charter, which we would not have been able to alter in the same way in relation to a board which was a purely commercial board, or in relation to this scheme if it had been handed over to a commercial board, we have not very definite responsibilities to that Board to see that something even more than strict fairness is given to them.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand the position the Electricity Supply Board will be liable&mdash;to take two specific cases&mdash;in Dublin and in Cork to pay on valuations which will mulct them in Cork of £10,000 a year and in Dublin of about £30,000.  But the history of that £10,000 and that £30,000 is certainly a matter for investigation. Just before the Electricity Board took over there was a complaint of the valuation of the electricity supply undertaking in Cork, and acting upon some very recent decision of the English courts as to the liability for rates the amount of rates which they were due to pay was raised from £1,000 to £9,000.  I am not at all clear that in picking £9,000 to-day to stereotype it we are acting fairly to the Board.  Why should it not be £1,000 instead of £9,000?  I am not now suggesting a figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the rates could not be raised unless the valuation was raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  The point I am putting to you is whether that valuation, which has been raised, in the last year or so, 1,000 per cent. is a valuation which ought to be stereotyped.  Dublin was reasonably content to receive from the Electricity Supply Board, and therefore to add to the cost of electricity, about £7,000 a year in rates. That is being raised to somewhere about £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being raised without justification&mdash;that is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether that is the point at which it should be stereotyped.  I am not saying anything one way or the other.  What I am saying is that I am not at all clear that the mere accident that this Bill is introduced this year instead of eighteen months ago is a reason why electricity in Dublin should be taxed with the total amount of that rate.  If this Bill had been introduced earlier, or if this thing had been included in the 1927 Act&mdash;that the valuation should be as it was then and should be stereotyped at that-then something like £24,000 or so less in the year would have to be put on to the cost of electricity in Dublin.  When we come to deal with this Bill in more detail that is a question that we will have to investigate carefully. The reason put forward for putting the rate on to the electricity as distinct merely from the occupation of a building is that they are in competition with other commercial enterprises selling light, power and heat.  I would be glad to know later whether the same thing that occurred in relation to the electricity supply has already happened in relation to the Gas Company.  If, for instance, the Gas Company have had their valuation multiplied by ten, then on the grounds of not allowing the Electricity Supply <Col N="583" /> Board to compete unfairly there does seem to be a case for charging the Electricity Supply Board at the rate of a higher valuation, though the question still remains as to whether you should put that extra charge upon power and lighting.</P>
      <P>I listened to the argument of the Minister, and I think there is something in part of that argument.  He gave a reason why he should distinguish between the people actually engaged in generating stations and the people who are engaged in other portions of the work.  I think it is quite possible that cases could be given in relation to individual units which have been taken over which would show that there are distinct hardships in particular cases. Whether it is popular or unpopular, I am not in favour of compensating everybody for everything; but where there shall be shown, outside the area of generating station employment, actual hardship resulting from this thing, I think obviously it ought to be considered.  You will find there are men who have had very long service in particular places whose local knowledge of the system there and the people using it is really their value in employment, whose actual employment will undoubtedly cease because the particular method of supplying in their area has been changed.  I hope when we reach the Committee Stage that some clause will be put in which, without being in any sense an omnibus clause in relation to things of this kind, will provide some method of appeals to a tribunal or something of that kind which will enable specific cases of hardship outside the area of generating station employees to be investigated. I think it is quite possible to do that, and it would be wise to do it.</P>

      <P>The principle which the Minister enunciated with regard to compensation is a very new one. I hope he will be able to explain it a little more convincingly than when he was introducing the Bill.  Does he hold that if nationally the scope for employment of persons disemployed by the closing down of a generating station is extended, the local claim will not count? Does he hold, if a person who may be disemployed in Bray or Portarlington or some such place as that, has a likelihood of getting employment in Dublin, that consequently such a person has no claim to compensation? As the principle was enunciated it is to me entirely an unconvincing one because I think it leaves the person affected entirely to chance.  He can simply say he has got certain experience in connection with the distribution of electricity; but he has got to go through all the difficulties of establishing his claim with a new employer. Personal disadvantages that he may have been able to overcome when he first obtained employment <Col N="585" /> are now again staring him in the face.  He has to be tested by new people.  I am not, for one, inclined to vote for this principle.  If the principle of compensation is at all admitted I think in justice that it will have to be extended to people who are put out of permanent employment through the operations of the Shannon Board.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Minister towards the Killaloe fishermen seems to be altogether unjustifiable. He talks about a general principle and says that they have no special right because anybody may come in and fish where they were fishing.  The real fact is that there are 20 or 30 people who have been fishing there and they have followed this particular occupation as their source of livelihood.  Now, by public action, this livelihood is going to be taken away.  It is by the action of this State that is being done.  Whatever general principles may be adduced in favour of neglecting them, the fact is that these 20 or 30 individuals are now going to be deprived of their livelihood on the River Shannon by State action.  I do not know whether this Bill is such that we could propose to it an amendment dealing with compensation.  I think the opinion of the House should be tested upon this matter.

      <P>Most of the points raised on this Bill were in the nature of Committee points, but I will deal with some of them briefly.  Reference has been made to retrospective legislation, and in relation to Section 3 I have been asked if I have embarked since 1925 upon any construction schemes such as are indicated in the section.  I have also been asked generally if I have acted in any way contrary to the 1925 Act.  I said that the retrospective effect of Section 3 was introduced because of some doubts that there were with regard to Section 3 (1) (m) of the Act of 1925.  What is that section?  After giving myself powers in the paragraphs that run from (a) to (1), I wound up in the 1925 Act by saying that the Minister was empowered to &ldquo;do any act or thing which may be necessary for or incidental to the doing of anything which he is by this sub-section authorised to do.&rdquo;  I am prepared to stand on that in connection with anything that I have done, but there is a second party to the proposal and that party may want to be assured. I am prepared to take my stand that what I am doing is something which may be necessary for or incidental to the doing of anything that I am authorised to do.  I do not believe I have broken the law, but there are two parties to the contract, and the second party wants to be assured.  I am prepared to take the risk, but sometimes you do not get the other party equally prepared. Deputy Lemass said that this Bill was drafted by over 100 officials and draftsmen.

      <P>There never were anything like 100 officials and draftsmen.  The difference between this Bill and the amendment of a Bill which a certain Deputy brought in and in connection with which he was much affected by criticism, is that the Deputy set out to raise the age of consent, but he did not do it, while &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We did, and I will come to that point.  The Deputy asked me on Section 4 if there is only the matter of the Cork Electricity Supply Company why not confine Section 4 to it?  The Deputy must know that there is under consideration by the Board the question of agreements with all the unauthorised undertakings up and down the country.  They may be dealt with in one block, and, again, there may be a necessity for the Minister for Finance to grant them in a particular half year more than the £400,000 which, under the old legislation, he might have to grant.  These agreements may come to a head before the year is out.  It is necessary to have this clause so enlarged as to enable the Minister for Finance in any half year in which the necessity arises to grant more than the £400,000.  The main thing to observe is that the total of £2,500,000 cannot be increased, and that it is not now a question of extra payment.  If the Deputy thinks that the Minister for Finance is going to loosen up and give money to the Electricity Supply Board earlier than they would be entitled to receive it, then he has little experience of the Minister for Finance and his Department. It is retrospective for the reason that there might be a legal effect upon the agreement for sale, which has already been concluded, but which has not actually been effected if the Board were not always able, and were not now retrospectively enabled to get more advanced than £400,000 in the half year in which the agreement for sale was <Col N="588" /> concluded.  That was the reason for making this somewhat retrospective.</P>
      <P>As to Section 5, the Deputy referred to a principle which I enunciated, but left out portion of the statement I made when enunciating that principle.  I said that the loans to the Board should be more or less at the rate at which it cost the Central Fund to borrow, plus the cost of accommodation.  That would include all the charges incurred in gathering in the money.</P>
      <P>I do not at all agree, and I do not see myself ever agreeing, that there has been any injustice done to the Clare County Council by reason of the charges that have been put upon it owing to the Shannon scheme. What I see mainly arising out of the Shannon scheme is this big fact, that one and three-quarter million pounds in three years was expended in the vicinity of Clare and Limerick in wages, and the benefits that have accrued to these areas over a particular short period have been far more than would compensate them for any small deficits there may be in rates by reason of the small amount of agricultural land, rated in that way, being taken from them for the purpose of the canal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, this Bill is not perpetual.  Hereafter it may be decided to make a better adjustment as between the electricity consumer, the taxpayer, and the ratepayer.  At the moment the Board is having imposed on it all the liabilities of an independent business concern in the matter of income tax, nearly all the liabilities of an independent commercial concern in the matter of rating, and has, in addition, imposed upon it repayment charges because it is financed from the Central Fund, which no commercial undertaking has imposed upon it.  It is bearing a bigger burden&mdash; at least the scheme is that it will bear, in 1932, a bigger burden than any commercial undertaking has to bear.  I think it is necessary that hereafter there must be a better adjustment as between the electricity <Col N="589" /> consumer, who will be paying for the scheme through his rates; the taxpayer, who might have to foot the bill if income tax is not paid, and the ratepayer, who might have, not to foot the bill, because that does not arise, but might be deprived of a lowering of rates which would otherwise accrue to him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass said that if even one permanent employee has been found to have lost his employment then there should be compensation terms.  I do not think that any permanent employee can lose his employment except with compensation.  If the Deputy means by permanent employee a man who was entitled to regard his employment as more or less permanent and if he loses his employment, then I <Col N="590" /> take it that man loses his employment because he is not considered sufficiently good in competition with new entrants in electrical work.  If he is not considered sufficiently good, we should not compensate him. That may seem hard and ruthless, but you cannot take up the position that simply because a man finds himself in a particular line of work, not guaranteed as an occupation in perpetuity, he must be compensated because other people come into the same field of employment when the field is considerably enlarged and he is dismissed.  That is a case equal to that of the man who is in employment who is dismissed for incompetence or because his employer thinks he can get a better man.  Nobody has security of tenure except on the consideration of being equal to what the employer can get at the same rate in competition.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that those who will now have the giving of employment will enrol their staff on the basis of absolute merit?  I do not think the Minister is in a position to do that.  If the Board is an independent Board they will have been appointed presumably because of their business ability, not because they are known to be the most just men in the country, or that they are guaranteed to treat everybody who comes before them absolutely on his merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer the last point first.  The Board is appointed as a business board.  The Deputy makes a distinction between their appointment being made on the basis of justice and on the basis of merit.  Merit to me means the best men for the best positions.  It is a good line for the Board to go on, and a business board will go on it.  If we <Col N="591" /> find that they do not, there is a clause in the old Act which allows the Board to avail of the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission for all their appointments.  If there are appointments which Deputies might like to raise I should rather that they would raise them privately with me than by open questions in the House.  But we might get to the point that we will have to impose on the Board the necessity of making appointments through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  As to Deputy Fahy's point, I should like to have it go from this House, and I take it as an expression of their opinion which I should put to the Board after debate in this House, that it is the desire of the House that people who are now engaged by undertakers in electricity work should be the first considered, but nothing more than that; not that they should be given preference, but that they should be first considered.  If they are considered on their merits not to be equal to others, they will not be appointed. That is a perfectly sound position to reach, and a perfectly sound proposition to put to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Doyle and Byrne raised a point as to the pension rights.  The situation under this Bill is that the compensation terms set out under the Act of 1927 are now being secured to certain individuals who were always intended to have security, but it so happens that the compensation terms did not flow to them.  The whole effect of the 1927 Act was that people who were in the pensionable employment of an undertaking taken over by the Board should go into the pensionable employment on the same terms of the new undertakers.  If they are dismissed the pension counts as part of the emoluments.  The word &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; was used in order to cover that, and in assessing the amount of compensation which ought to be paid to people not taken over by the Board, but dismissed from their service, the pension rights must be <Col N="592" /> capitalised and taken into consideration when compensation terms are being given.  Section 39 (9) of the 1927 Act has a certain reference to the point, in addition to the schedule which deals with compensation.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Hogan's remarks, there is no question of repentance in this Bill whatsoever.  There is a question of avoiding legal action, which, I think, would have only one result, but which, while it would secure the results I desire, would pile up costs which would go to lawyers and would have to be paid for by the consumers of electricity. I want to save the consumers of electricity these costs, and we are going to make the position clear. There is no question of repentance, no question of a new situation having developed; of something new being imposed on the Board which was not heretofore imposed.  We are keeping the same exemption which was always clearly spoken of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no repentance and therefore I do not see why the Deputy spoke of repentance in this context.  The Deputy made an analogy between these cot fishermen and people who had land-The difference, of course, is that the people whose lands were taken from them were paid compensation in respect of the land because they owned the land.  These fishermen were only members of the public who exercised the right that any of the public had a right to exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bounded always by the life of the people.  Any member of the public had a right to go there.  Where would I stop if I undertook to pay compensation? Why should I pay compensation to some man who had put out a boat on the river, and, incidentally, managed to put out a boat in preserved waters where the owner did not care to exercise his right to prohibit, <Col N="593" /> and refuse compensation to the innumerable carters all over the country who will not be deprived of employment, but will have their chance of employment lessened by reason of the fact that coal supplies will be diminished owing to the Shannon scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a right which is enjoyed by every member of the public.  Incidentally, these men if another scheme that is envisaged at present goes through, will most certainly have their field of employment enlarged by reason of further activities in the fisheries unless they are rooted to a particular spot in that river.  These people are merely exercising the right that any one of the three millions in this community can exercise, and there is no reason why they should get compensation more than any others of the three millions.  Let us have it discussed on an amendment, but as far as the general principle is concerned the case is against them.</P>

      <P>As far as compensation is concerned, I hope the Deputy is going to wait for many years.  Deputy Byrne raised the same point as Deputy Doyle and talked of the matter of pensions accrued. Pensions accrued are a charge.  Pensions which might accrue if people remained in their employment for a certain number of years longer will come for consideration under the question of emoluments and conditions of service.</P>
      <P>I cannot admit that either the Act of 1925 or the Act of 1927 was obscure. The only doubts removed by this Bill are doubts which, if they were not removed by this simple process of legislation, will have to be removed by a court action.  It is better to save the costs to the community and to the electricity consumer, than to have these costs imposed on them by reason of the expenses of a court action.</P>
      <P>As to what Deputy Flinn said about certain difficulties in the interpretation of the Act, I have not yet found these difficulties presenting themselves to my Department, although I am in touch with the whole working of the Act.  As far as accounts are concerned, he talked of &ldquo;line-ball&rdquo; accounts.  The accounts which will have to be produced will have to be produced as and when the Minister for Finance and myself ordain, and when they are produced in a particular way then a discussion may arise upon them as to whether or not charges and expenses in connection with them and profits accruing from them could be measured within the compartments of a particular account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that in this way: There is a prohibition against charging the expenses of a particular area against another area. That is sufficiently good for the purpose of allowing a discrimination between accounts.  I do not think it would be fair to the Board to ask them to segregate their accounts for such things as sales and house wiring as between different areas.  The area of distinction should not operate there, but there should be departmental accounts for such items as departmental sales of apparatus, generating costs, house wiring, distribution, and so on.  It is the law that accounts may be divided from the point of view of area, and if people are sufficiently interested to demand to see that no area is charged distribution expenses of another area, the Act is sufficiently clear on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from what the Minister thinks, what does the Act prescribe?  Take, for instance, the Cork transformer area, which would be a line-ball proposition.  Have you the right to know what the charge is for electricity, what they get for installing houses, and what they get for selling plant?  I simply want to know whether it is clear in the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am bound to see such accounts as will show me that no area is being charged with the expenses of distribution in any other area.  I am not going to allocate accounts for house wiring, installation, sales of apparatus as between areas.  These will be kept sectionalised.  The costs of distribution within an area ought to be made on such a scale as will show that a particular area is not being charged with the distribution costs of any other area.  The Deputy said that increased amounts will have to be voted annually.  I think they will.  I hope to come before the House within twelve months with plans for the enlargement of the Shannon scheme, because so far as I can see consumption has got to the point when a new storage scheme at least will be necessary.  The Shannon scheme is so definitely a success that we must go on to get further power.  We must go on to get further generating power or to get such extra storage as will give us the necessary power.  Undoubtedly, we will have to come along for extra amounts We will get to the point where moneys will have to be voted yearly for Shannon development just as they are voted at the moment on the Telephone Capital Account.  Nobody is going to object to any money being voted as long as it can be shown that the first moneys voted were remunerative to the State and that there is every prospect that the new moneys voted are going to be also remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Flinn has said in regard to Section 5, that we are taking back with one hand what we are pretending to give with the other, the Minister for Finance is given power under Section 5 to vary the rate at which interest is to be paid.  The Minister for Finance may so vary the rate of interest as <Col N="597" /> to leave himself unremunerated, that he himself would be paying more for the money than he was charging the Electricity Supply Board, but if he did so it would have to come out of the Central Fund and there would arise criticism.  The line which we propose to follow is that having granted the Board certain moneys to meet arrears of interest during the unremunerative early years, previously estimated about three and now cut down to about one and a half, the Board should be charged a rate of interest which is comparable with the rate at which the State borrows plus the cost of securing that money.  The Deputy has also spoken about changing the Charter of the Electricity Supply Board, and he raised the analogy of a sale to an outside corporation.  The analogy is unsound. No corporation would have taken over on the terms of the 1927 Act.  There is no corporation living that would have taken over under a clause which says that the charges shall be such as just to meet the annual expenses.  There is no corporation in the world that I have ever heard of that would be willing to take over on the basis simply that they are to meet their expenses. The analogy of a commercial concern is stymied right at the start by that consideration.  Under the 1927 Act the Board are prohibited from making profits.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked why stereotype the valuations on which rates will be paid.  The Deputy is looking on this Board as an undertaking in competition with other undertakings of a similar type.  That is not the principle upon which this Bill is based.  The very idea of that principle is gone.  When you have a gas company whose main endeavour in life is to secure profits, and an Electricity Supply Board who are prohibited from making profits, the analogy goes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that the interest on capital is fixed. The principle at any rate here is not that we are looking on the Electricity Supply Board as in competition with other undertakings. The principle is, that we are giving the local authorities what hitherto they had the right to expect from a <Col N="599" /> certain type of undertaking in their area.  There is no proper way of assessing the valuation of a concern which is, to the extent this is prohibited from any profit-making. It is necessary to allow local authorities to understand what in any year they should look forward to and what amount they should budget for.  If it is said that it is stereotyped, I will answer that by saying that this legislation is going to last only until it is changed.  We have stated that if what the Electricity Supply Board has to pay is too heavy a burden to put upon electricity consumers then that can be changed.  It will have to be changed in time when certain other re-adjustments come, but until notice is given some time ahead local authorities ought to be in a position to know what they are entitled to receive from their undertaking and on what basis their budgets are going to be prepared.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Everett's comments, every person employed in a generating station must get compensation. If the Deputy answers me by saying that they have not got it so far I say it is because of the legal doubt arising out of the old Act.  This means that they will be retrospectively compensated.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Moore's question, I can only answer by saying that I do not see why men who are put out of employment which is not permanent should be compensated. They are to be put out under conditions of enlarged opportunities of employment in the trade in which they were.  They either are expert and efficient or they are not.  If they are not, they never had the right to be kept.  They are now being thrown into an enlarged field of effort.  They have some experience. They are up against newcomers. The odds are in their favour.  If they fail, it is simply because they are not worth taking on. In those circumstances, they should not be compensated.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the substitution of fifty pounds for thirty-six pounds and of forty pounds for twenty-seven pounds as the deductions in respect of children.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the claims which have been made by the present Government and which they have very often advanced in order to secure support for themselves, is that the rate of income tax in this country is lower than it is in Great Britain.  Admittedly, the nominal rate of income tax is lower. Here we are supposed to pay income-tax at the rate of 3s. in the £, as compared with the nominal rate of 4s. 6d in Great Britain.  Whatever advantage there may be to the general taxpayer by reason of the fact that nominally the rate is lower in this country than in Great Britain, it is entirely neutralised by the fact that the allowances, rebates, and deductions, allowed to the taxpayer before the amount of his assessable income is arrived at, are almost in every case very much lower than in the case of Great Britain.  The practical <Col N="605" /> effect of that is that, so far as the great mass of income taxpayers in this country are concerned, they are paying much higher rates than in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples.  In the case of an income taxpayer who is married, who has three children, and who is drawing allowances in respect of his wife and children, he would pay on an earned income of £400 tax to the amount of £3 7s. 6d. a year.  A taxpayer similarly circumstanced in Great Britain pays nothing.  A taxpayer here with a wife and three children and an income of £600 would pay £16 17s. 6d., while a taxpayer similarly circumstanced in Great Britain would pay £11 10s. 0d.  A man here with an earned income of £800 would pay £43 17s. 6d. as compared with £32 2s. 0d. in Great Britain.  A man here with an income of £1,000 a year&mdash;I think in reaching £1,000 a year I have dealt with fully 50 per cent. of income taxpayers&mdash;would pay £70 17s. 6d., whereas in Great Britain a taxpayer similarly circumstanced, with a wife and three children, would pay £69 12s. 0d.</P>
    <P>The incomes which I have dealt with are what is known as earned incomes, but the same position applies, though in a lesser degree, to those in the enjoyment of unearned income.  It is only when a £700 limit is reached that the income taxpayer with an unearned income begins to pay as much here as in Great Britain.  Therefore, the statement which, as I have said, the Ministry so often advance and which their supporters so often argue in their favour, that income tax in this country is lower than in Great Britain, is quite unfounded and illusory. So far as the general mass of taxpayers are concerned, they are paying at a very much higher rate than those in similar circumstances in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The purpose of my amendment is to endeavour, so far as the smaller taxpayers are concerned, to redress that inequality to some extent and to bring the position, so far as those on lower incomes are concerned, <Col N="606" /> into accord with the public statements of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.  For that purpose we propose to increase the allowances paid for children by increasing the allowance for the first child from £36 to £50, and in respect of the second and other children by increasing the allowance from £27 to £40 per annum.</P>
    <P>In the previous year we put down an amendment embodying not only this principle, but also a principle which we thought would have afforded compensation to the Exchequer for any loss which the increase in allowances might occasion. Unfortunately, since that proposal would have involved an increase in the tax on taxpayers with higher incomes, we were precluded by Standing Orders from moving it.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the Minister would only in this regard imitate the proposal recently put before the British Parliament in regard to income tax, he could find sufficient compensation for any loss to the revenue which the allowances we propose would result in by re-grading or limiting allowances to people with incomes below £600 and by reducing proportionately the allowances paid to taxpayers with incomes above that sum.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech on the Minister's financial statement I had occasion to point out how the burden of taxation on those with smaller incomes had increased after the years 1925-6.  As I said, I calculated that in the case of incomes not exceeding, I should say, £300 or £350, the amount of tax paid increased from £21 18s. 10d. in 1925-6 to £23 14s. 7d. in 1929-30.  On the other hand, however, I pointed out that a person with an income of £1,000 was this year paying about £97 13s. 0d., whereas in 1925-6 he was paying about £119 17s. 5d.  Similarly in 1925-6 a person with an income of £3,000 would have been paying tax at the rate of £726 per annum, whereas in the year just closed the amount which he would have paid would not have exceeded £351.  It would seem to me, from the figures I have given showing the general <Col N="607" /> trend of taxation in this country, that the Minister is bound in duty and in conscience to consider the position of the poorer people in this country.  The poorer people in this country are not only those who earn their livelihood with their hands, but those who occasionally have to use their brains, those generally included in the denomination &ldquo;middle class.&rdquo;  I think that the great bulk of our people come within the category of those whose burden of taxation has increased during the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>I certainly think that the person with a family, living in middle-class circumstances, who has to pay income tax is in a very uncomfortable position&mdash;is in a position in which he can ask the Minister to grant him some relief, particularly in view of the figures I have cited as to the general trend of taxation in relation to those with higher incomes.  As I have said, I am perfectly certain that if this amendment be accepted, whatever loss the acceptance of the proposals in their present form may give rise to, the Minister, who has power to regrade the allowances so far as they relate to people with higher incomes, can make good if he will only imitate the example recently set by a Chancellor in another place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the proposal to give relief in the direction indicated in the amendment.  I support the general principle, too, that taxation should be on a different basis from what it is.  Year after year, demands have been made for special consideration for the smaller income taxpayer, and especially for the family man.  In the discussion on the Budget, I indicated my belief that this system of taxation was a special encouragement to the bachelor and a special hardship on the man who had a family which he was endeavouring to educate.  That demand has been repeated year after year, as long as the present Minister has been in office.  Every year he hardens himself against the proposal.  He has <Col N="608" /> pointed out that while he is personally in sympathy with the demand, he sees no way of finding the necessary revenue.  He can find the revenue if he simply changes the incidence of taxation, and makes the people who can best afford it pay. That is the obvious way to find the revenue for this purpose&mdash;putting on the tax and seeing that it is collected. I think this is particularly the type of tax that the well-to-do people should be asked to bear a bigger share of.  Indirect taxation, from which we get the greater part of our revenue, falls much more heavily on the poorer classes of the community than on those in better circumstances. It is only fair that those in better circumstances should be asked to pay a bigger proportion of the direct tax which is raised through income tax.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell says that this matter has been pressed on a number of occasions, and that, while I expressed sympathy with the demand, nothing was done. This matter has been specially pressed since 1927.  It has happened that since 1927 there has not been the possibility of giving an actual remission of taxation.  In 1928, we had to find very considerable sums of money, and fresh taxation had to be imposed.  Last year also, there were difficulties in balancing the Budget without increasing taxation. While this year there were not the same difficulties, there was no surplus available for giving relief to the taxpayer.  I have repeatedly stated that if we found ourselves in a position to give remission of taxation, whatever sum could be made available should be devoted to this purpose. I adhere to that.  I do not think, however, that that is so desirable that we should increase taxation &mdash;that we should actually impose a burden simply for the purpose of being able to give this relief.  If we were making a number of changes in our scheme of taxation it would be a different proposition.  If we had to increase other taxes for other reasons I think it would be all right <Col N="609" /> so to arrange the increase that some part might be made available for this purpose.  But I should not like to propose new imposts on some classes of the community simply for the purpose of giving these reliefs. It is well to bear in mind that while certain people, who cannot have much money to spare, are liable to income tax, the tax is not heavy. Take the individual with an income of £400, to whom Deputy MacEntee referred.  The income tax in the case of a man earning £400 a year who is married and has three children works out at about 2d. in the £.  That is not a heavy rate of income tax. though, when he has to find the £3 odd, it is doubtless hard for him to do so.  It is an exaggeration to say that our present scheme is an encouragement to the bachelor and is directed against the married man with family responsibilities.  There are reliefs which are not inconsiderable and which operate to exempt very large numbers of married men from income tax.  Where these reliefs do not exempt them altogether they bring down the charges to very small proportions.  I still adhere to the view that when it is possible&mdash;either because there is a surplus available for distribution, or because of convenience when making larger changes in regard to taxation this relief should be given.  But I should not like to assume responsibility for imposing taxation to the extent of £75,000 or £80,000 in order to give this relief.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the deletion of the words &ldquo;equal to one-tenth of the amount of that income&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in respect of an income of less than £400, equal to one-sixth of the amount of that income; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in respect of an income in excess of four hundred pounds, <Col N="610" /> £66 13s. 4d. together with a sum equal to one-tenth of the amount of that income in excess of four hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the allowance in respect of earned income and, in so far as incomes of less than £400 are concerned, it proposes to increase the present allowance of one-tenth of the amount of the income up to one-sixth and in respect of an income in excess of £400 to make the allowance £66 13s. 4d., together with a sum equal to one-tenth of the amount of that income in excess of £400.  We propose, so far as the allowance in respect of earned income is concerned, to have that allowance granted in respect of incomes up to £400 at the same rate as it is granted in Great Britain, and above incomes of that amount to retain it as it is at present.  I do not know that it is necessary to add much to what I said on amendment No. 1.  This is one of those allowances which, because they are less in this country than in Great Britain, operate to make the real rate of income tax upon the lower incomes higher here than it is in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might cite one or two cases.  Owing to the changes recently made in income tax in Great Britain, it is not possible, within the limits of the lower incomes, to secure corresponding cases, the citation of which would show how unfairly the present scale of allowances operates as between the person who is in enjoyment of an unearned income and the man who has to earn his income.  As I have said already, below the figure of £700 income, the tax paid in Great Britain, whether on earned or unearned income, is uniformly lower than it is here.  Let us take the case of a person with an income of £800.  A person with an unearned income of £800, who has a wife and three children, pays here £55 17s. 6d.  In Great Britain, that person would pay £62 2s. 2d.  If this income were earned, the same person would pay £43 17s. 6d. here, and in Great Britain he would only pay £32 2s. 0d.  Thus, in the case of an <Col N="611" /> unearned income of £800, the Irish taxpayer would enjoy an advantage over the British taxpayer of £6 4s. 8d., while if the Irish taxpayer earned his income he would pay £43 17s. 6d., while the British taxpayer, in the same circumstances, would pay £32 2s. 0d.  Thus while the rentier with an income of £800 would be £6 4s. 8d. worse off in Great Britain than here, the worker &mdash;the man who earns his income&mdash; would be £11 15s. 6d. worse off here than in Great Britain. I think that case is fairly conclusive.  I think it does show that the present scale of allowances operates unfairly on the man who earns his income.  The importance of that is that the real income in the case where income is earned is very much less than is the income which is drawn from investments. For one thing, it is, as a general rule, much less certain.</P>
    <P>For another thing, there are certain considerations&mdash;loss of time, and so forth&mdash;which have to be weighed before the real income of a person who is earning it can be arrived at.  It is for that reason that this particular allowance is given.  I submit that the circumstances in this country are such that the amount of real income in the case of a man who has to earn his income is probably less even than it is in Great Britain, and that, therefore, the allowance made in respect of earned income in this country should be higher than it is in Great Britain.  I am not, in this amendment, asking that this allowance should be equalised throughout the whole scale, but I do suggest that, so far as the lower ranges of income are concerned, the allowance ought to be levelled up to what it is in Great Britain.  It is for that reason I have suggested that up to the limit of £400 of income the allowance should be made at the rate of one-sixth of the income.  Above that I am content in the present circumstances of the country that it should remain as it is, but I think there is an unanswerable case for lowering the allowance in the smaller income.</P>

      <P>There is this other aspect of the question.  The Deputy took the case of the married man and said that allowances are not made in this country in proportion to what they were in Great Britain. I was interested in hearing the Deputy quoting Great Britain in these matters as a country which should be followed, but leaving that aspect of the question for the moment, as we all know, in this country those who have families have heavier burdens to carry in the matter of the cost of living in supporting these families than those in Great Britain. So here we have some of those compensating advantages or disadvantages, but they very seriously affect the problem, and I would like to have heard the Deputy dealing with them in that particular connection.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to estimate what the passage of this particular amendment would mean, but two or three methods have been tried in the office of the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at a figure, and the method which gives the lowest figure works out at somewhere between £100,000 and £110,000.  It is obvious that we could not give a remission that would lose the Exchequer £110,000 without proposing taxation to find that sum.  I would like to reply to Deputy MacEntee's main argument that we must follow the reliefs that are given in Great Britain in all cases by saying that I do not think that possibly reliefs that in Great <Col N="613" /> Britain might only cost, say, one-tenth of the income tax revenue, could operate here to cost us twenty-five per cent. or thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the revenue.  An enormous proportion of the British income tax is got from very wealthy people, of whom we have few here, and reliefs of the kind that Deputy MacEntee is proposing cost us a much greater percentage of our total income tax revenue than similar reliefs cost in Great Britain.  I do not accept it as a conclusive argument when it is stated that when relief is given in Great Britain it should also be given here.  It is quite possible that you might have a whole series of reliefs of this nature given in Great Britain over a period of years, and if we were to attempt to follow that our revenue from income tax would be reduced out of all proportion to the reduction that these reliefs would give in Great Britain.  In any case, consideration of this particular matter must, in my opinion, be held over for another occasion.  When I had a Committee examining it a year or so ago they contemplated finding some of the money that would be lost by such a relief by reducing the range over which the half rate would be allowed. In brief, we will have to face up to these problems of relief for ourselves and with regard to our own social conditions generally, and I think those definitely forbid us attempting to adhere precisely to the scales of relief which may be given in England.</P>

      <P>Possibly there is not such a great deal of difference between the Minister and myself in that regard.  Does not the Minister think that if he changed his attitude it would be honester instead of pretending that our income tax is chargeable at 3/- in the £ to say that it is charged at a very much higher rate?  The point is that any benefit that has accrued from the fact that we have a lower nominal rate of income tax is an advantage confined entirely to those whose incomes are more than £1,000 per annum.  As far as any taxpayer with an income of <Col N="614" /> less than that sum is concerned, there is no advantage.  As a matter of fact the actual rate of tax paid by him in this country is very much higher than in Great Britain, in some cases almost 50 per cent. higher. Therefore, would it not be much honester and fairer to the people of the country if the Minister candidly said that the rate of income tax was very much higher than in Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendments:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any claimant proves that any portion of his income arose directly from stocks, shares or other investments in a manufacturing undertaking (or undertakings, as the case may be) established in Saorstát Eireann he shall, for the purpose of arriving at his assessable income, be entitled to a deduction of one-fifth of the income which thus arose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>4. Before sub-section (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If any claimant proves that any portion of his earned income arose directly from profits in a manufacturing undertaking (or undertakings, as the case may be) carried on in Saorstát Eireann, then for the purpose of arriving at his assessable income, he shall be entitled, in addition to the earned income allowance already provided for under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920, to a further deduction of one-tenth of such portion of his income as arose as aforesaid, but such deduction <Col N="615" /> shall not exceed £200 in the case of any individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we might take 3 and 4 together. I am quite aware that the drafting of these amendments leaves a good deal to be desired, but what I am concerned about is the principle which we have advocated before from these benches, that any person who invests his capital in Irish industries, in view of the many things that have been said about us, in view of the uncertainty of returns from certain of these ventures, in view of the fact that the general mentality in financial circles is to regard enterprises abroad with much more favour than those here, in face of these difficulties, disadvantages and discouragements should, because he has the patriotism and often good sense, receive more encouragement at the hands of the Minister.  I am not putting in any quantity arithmetical argument to show him how these arrangements would operate and effectively stimulate interest in Irish enterprises in regard to the investors who invest in them.  I have shown&mdash;at least, it did operate until this year&mdash;that even if we had a lower rate of income tax here for unearned income that that did operate to make foreign investments often more attractive to the Irish investor than they were to the native investors in those countries in which the undertakings were located.  For instance, I advanced arguments last year and the year before to show that the shares of some well-known industrial enterprises in Great Britain would be correspondingly more attractive to Irish than British investors by reason of the fact that the rate of income tax on unearned income was lower in this country than in Great Britain.  I think that it applies with even greater force to-day. I think these investments are correspondingly more attractive to the Irish investor than to the British investor and for the reason he is able to go into the market and buy shares in those at prices which the English investor would regard as more or less prohibitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> Apart altogether from that, there is the fact that our industries are generally in need of capital and that a good deal of discouragement awaits the man who proposes to invest his money in Irish enterprises.  Bankers and stockbrokers will tell him that it is foolish and possibly his prejudices will operate in the same way.  If he overcomes these, I think he is entitled to consideration at the hands of the Minister.  It is that some inducement be offered to neutralise the discouragements which await him that we put down these amendments which I have asked the Minister to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee in pointing out in his opening sentence that probably the wording of the amendments may leave something to be desired, put his finger on one of the difficulties of the situation.  If the matter had been simple it would have been comparatively easy for the Deputy to have drafted an amendment which would cover it. First, it seems to me that tremendous difficulty would be experienced in administering a scheme of this sort no matter how carefully the legislation might be drafted and, of course, I think that very intricate legislation would be necessary. There is a question which will arise of what is a manufacturing undertaking. Remember I do not think it can be suggested that it would be confined to undertakings which were concerned solely in the manufacture of goods which they sold wholesale, because there are a great many sorts of manufacture carried on which are part of a mixed business. A very common sort of manufacture, for example, is the manufacture of certain articles of apparel which is part of a drapery business. In the case of a drapery business where dressmaking is carried on, a certain part of the profits would go to the retail side of the business, and another part to manufacture, and often very great difficulty would arise as a result of that.  That goes right through many shops engaged largely in the manufacture or sale of furniture.  If a manufacturing business <Col N="617" /> in furniture is, going on troubles of all sorts would arise in connection with deciding what proportion of their profits were entitled to this relief, and what proportion were not.  A good deal of the loss which would arise in connection with such a relief would be loss which seems to me would give no result.  For instance, apparently a man who had an income of £5,000 from Guinness's shares would get a tax relief of about £150 per annum. Take that as a particular case.  No benefit at all is going to arise to an Irish industry as a result of giving relief to the man who happens to have invested in the shares of that particular company.  Difficulties would arise then in connection with firms like the Imperial Tobacco Company.  That is a manufacturing industry established in the Saorstát which has Saorstát shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a certain proportion of the dividends which a man received here from the Imperial Tobacco Company were to be ascribed to the manufacturing of that concern in the Irish Free State considerable difficulties would again arise.  It would be impossible, of course, to estimate what such a thing would cost until properly framed legislation had been drafted, but no doubt if we were to legislate in the terms of the Deputy's amendment a very great amount of revenue would be lost, because the courts, both here and in Great Britain, in interpreting income tax law, generally take the view that if there is the slightest doubt about the taxpayer being liable the taxpayer goes free.  In a case between the Revenue, which represents the general public, and the individual taxpayer, the courts do not really look at the equity of the matter.  If there is any doubt at all the taxpayer goes free, and if this were carried into effect it would probably happen that all sorts of firms that did no manufacturing at all, that perhaps even did no repairs at all, would get the benefit of it.  I believe there is one firm which imports <Col N="618" /> furniture and French polishes it, but does no other manufacturing process on it, and if these amendments were passed it would almost certainly get relief.  Undoubtedly, in respect of companies like the Imperial Tobacco Company relief would be given and the loss to the Revenue would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>There are certain peculiar things in connection with these amendments, taken together.  One is that the person with unearned income, the person whose income is derived from stocks and shares, would get a reduction to the extent of one-fifth, whereas the individual who is working in the industry, who is running it himself, would only get one-tenth, and the total deduction is limited to £200, so that in this case the person with unearned income would be treated in a very much more lenient manner than the person who is actually working in his industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general rule, the investment is a voluntary one, whereas in the case of a person engaged in the actual business, very often he is there on account of circumstances over which he has no control, because he has to live in the country, and because he has to do something in the country.  But the voluntary element is much greater in the case of the person affected by amendment 3 than in the case of the person affected by amendment 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I think one of the big arguments is really that it is not anything connected with income tax that prevents investment here.  It is not even so much a question of the earnings of the investment as the feelings which have become widespread for a variety of reasons, and for causes operating for a long period, that probably there would be no earnings at all, and that there is a risk of the capital disappearing.  These are the things that I think encourage people <Col N="619" /> to invest abroad readily, and that make them unwilling to invest here. There are, of course, a variety of other factors, but they are of this character, that they frequently cause a person to hesitate to invest here, even when the prospects of earning, so far as they can be seen, are very good, and it seems likely that large dividends will be paid, and to invest outside in what appears to be something less attractive. I do not think that you could overcome that feeling in this way.  I believe the difficulties of operating this sort of thing, the administrative expenses, and the dissatisfaction that would arise from such a complicated system, would weigh very heavily against it, and that it is by other methods which have been applied, whether Deputies think they have been sufficiently applied or not, that we should seek to encourage industry.  If we were to think about it, it would certainly require an extraordinary amount of consideration.  I do not think that legislation dealing with a matter like this could be drafted unless we had a Departmental Committee working on it for probably two, three or four months.  Frankly, I am no believer in this system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now reached the stage of if he were to think about it.  That is really a remarkable stage to have reached after all this time.  If he thought a little bit more slowly he would be going very rapidly backwards.  He puts up a number of difficulties, but the onus of proof is on the person who wants to benefit.  All the difficulty is on him.  If he does not think the benefits worth while to take the trouble, then he will not take the trouble.  Why the Minister should be worried because there would be a difficulty on somebody else to do something I cannot imagine.  Guinness is an existing business.  One of the difficulties in dealing with all these income tax questions is that people want to concentrate on new business.  Personally I regard the existing businesses in Ireland merely <Col N="620" /> as the foundation.  You exempt, say, Guinness shares in order to produce an inducement to people to invest in other things than Guinness's shares.  Take the Imperial Tobacco Company.  The Imperial Tobacco Company has a certain relatively small interest in this country, and they might not take the trouble, having regard to the fact that the vast majority of their shareholders and the vastly larger portion of their interests are outside, and that the vastly larger proportion of their shareholders and their shareholders' incomes would not come under this provision.  As far as I can see, the Imperial Tobacco Company would not lose the Minister very much money.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the slightest doubt in relation to an income tax matter is resolved by the courts in favour of the taxpayer.  I suppose that is one of the reasons why the Revenue Commissioners are a court unto themselves, and even to the extent of violating the Constitution they make laws for themselves.  But if it was a question of doubt, surely having regard to this Bill we are now discussing, a Bill to remove doubts would provide no difficulty to any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All he has got to do is to introduce a Bill to say what was is not, that what is not was.  He said that income tax had nothing to do with investment. If you could provide a place in which people would be immune from the activities of income tax collectors, often of themselves well meaning, but very ingenious and utterly remorseless people, as an American said to me, you would not find standing room in this country. I do not know whether that is a good argument in favour of the proposal. But it is not right to suggest that the amount of income tax is the only thing in relation to it; the methods of collection and all the rest of it have to do with it also, and anything in the direction of relieving that would be useful.  My difficulty is this: If the Minister is against the principle, then he says no, and that is all there is about it, but it is not <Col N="621" /> the slightest use simply to put up a whole series of difficulties.  If he does want to do it, the thing can be done, and the onus of all the trouble can be put upon those who want to get the benefit of it.  If he would only face that fact we could get on. With reference to this sort of tenth reason business, there was a certain town council on one occasion which did not ring its bells on the coronation of a certain king, so they sent ten burghers, each with a reason to explain to the king why they did not ring the bells.  Nine of the reasons were excellent reasons but they were forgotten, because the tenth reason was that they had not any bell.  In exactly the same way the Minister has given us about fifty-five difficulties, but the real reason is that he is not prepared to lose revenue for the benefit of Irish industries.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that in the case of a manufacturing undertaking <Col N="622" /> any undistributed gains or profits arising out of such undertaking and employed to the satisfaction of the Revenue Authorities in extending premises or in installing new plant shall be exempt from tax, while so undistributed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is becoming a hardy annual, and probably will remain so until the Minister retires to that long, well-earned rest which we are now carefully preparing for him.  Still, as it is the Minister's own amendment, and as the Minister is too modest to advertise the virtues of the thing he has himself produced, it is only fair that he should have the opportunity of seeing it in the light of day, and of either acknowledging it or refusing to acknowledge it in the face of the House.  On a previous occasion the Minister said that this was the one line of country upon which he thought he could probably travel; in fact he was going into an intensive state of study in the intervening year, and at the end of the year, he was again prepared to enter upon an intensive study of this particular matter.  Probably he will, in another five years, come to the stage at which he might, as he says, begin to think of it.  Why does not the Minister do it?  Here again the onus of proof and all the trouble in relation to making it clear will rest with the beneficiary.  It is merely a matter for him to make those regulations. If it does not pay the people to get this amount of benefit they will not go to the trouble; if it does pay them, they will go to any amount of trouble.</P>
    <P>I think I will refer here to a case where the Harbour Board of Cork were building a wharf for Mr. Henry Ford, and in order to meet the income tax on the making of the wharf, they had to pay the Government £233.  They had to pay that sum in income tax for attempting to produce a condition in Cork from which the Minister is getting in-directly&mdash;due to the fact that there are millions of pounds being spent in wages&mdash;an enormous revenue.  In <Col N="623" /> exactly the same way the Minister here refuses to set the seed from which he might get considerable benefit.  I do not regard this thing as in any way a reduction of his revenue.  I regard it as the seed of very considerable revenue in the future.  The idea that we can more or less stereotype things as they are and be satisfied with existing conditions is a wrong idea.  We have got to get outside our present conditions and look at ourselves from the outside with the pre-supposition of a distinct and definite change in our condition.  We cannot envisage the condition in which under three millions of people are continuing to live narrow, meagre lives here.  We have to look at it from the point of view of what we can produce in the way of an effective change.  This is one piece of machinery.  Within its limits it is an effective piece of machinery to bring about that change.  It is time that the Minister did acknowledge his own child, and did glory in the fact that at least one good idea had penetrated from him into the economic possibilities of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an idea which various writers on taxation have advocated.  It is a proposal which might, without very great difficulty, be applied in the case of a joint stock company.  If it were applied in the case of private owners or private companies a considerable amount of difficulty and very many complications would result.  It might be necessary, in order to make the scheme actually workable, to extend it very far indeed.  On the other hand, it is not at all certain that it would be possible, and I am not sure either that it would be fair, to give such a concession to a joint stock company, a public company, and to refuse it to a private company, to a partnership or to individuals. It has not been possible to have the matter fully explored, and I could not agree to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take Deputy Flinn's view that an amendment of this nature, <Col N="624" /> if it were passed, is going to lead to extensions of business all round the place.  In fact its position would be that in certain cases it might facilitate and it might case extension, but extension depends on the need for it and on the business that is to be done.  All that a thing like this would do, even in the case of a joint stock company, would be to make it possible to do it with a certain amount of additional case in favourable circumstances.  All these income tax proposals have this characteristic, that the various reactions of them are difficult to see, and the adoption of a new principle without the most adequate examination might only lead to a loss of revenue in a manner that would bring no return and might only lead to irresistible claims from different sets of people being put forward which in themselves would entail a loss of revenue without any compensating advantage to the community or to industry generally.  It is because of that fact that, while I do not say to Deputy Flinn that I would never accept this amendment, I am not in a position to say that I would accept it now.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister suggest some time within human anticipation when he would make an attempt to embody this principle in legislation?  If he finds difficulties in the extent of the area or something of that kind we are all prepared to meet him in the matter; but when will he do something as distinct from asking us to wait while he thinks it out and worries about the possible reactions of things which he has not tried?  All I am asking him to accept is the principle of the matter, and I am asking him to get on with it in a limited manner only.  If he is afraid of the reactions, let him find out what the reactions are within a limited area and within a limited time.  Let him do something rather than be content with putting it on the long finger.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that no Income Tax, Corporation Profits Tax, Surtax or Excess Profits Duty shall be assessed, levied, or collected in respect of any income or profits in any accounting period prior to that beginning on 6th day of December, 1922.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment 8 is a corollary to that.  Amendment 6 provides that no taxes are to be levied or collected in respect of any period prior to that beginning on the 6th December, 1922.  First of all, no person should be made amenable to penalties in respect of anything which may have occurred prior to that period.  Up to the present moment persons have been liable to penalties in respect of certain wrongful returns which they may have made during that period or subsequent to that date or because of wrongful declarations which they may have made prior to that date.  We propose that in the case of &ldquo;any person who, on or before the 1st January, 1931, submits amended declarations showing their income from such investments for the three accounting periods prior to the 5th day of April, 1931, no proceedings for any penalties or otherwise shall be taken against such a person making such amended declaration in respect of any non-disclosure contained in any declaration made by such person prior to the making of such amended declaration, but the person making such amended declaration shall be liable for any arrears of income tax or surtax, and only for such arrears which may appear from such amended declaration to be due by such person for the said three accounting periods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say in support of <Col N="626" /> this amendment has been argued already before the Minister.  I am sure most members of the House are familiar with the situation which has been created in this country by the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners to collect, particularly in the case of excess profits, moneys which should have been paid to the British prior to 1921-22.  The position is that taxpayers to-day are being asked, first of all, to pay taxes not paid to the British Government; secondly, they are asked to pay interest on such taxes from the date upon which they should have been paid to the British Government; and, thirdly, they are asked to pay penalties for not having made returns in their proper time of their full income to the British Government. The important factor in connection with all this which the House ought to remember, and which the Minister for Finance should take into consideration, is that in 1919 practically every income tax office in the country was destroyed by order&mdash;notwithstanding anything the Minister may say to the contrary&mdash;of the Irish Republican Army.  Every man who destroyed such an office was guilty of a crime against the then existing British law in this country, but practically every person who engaged in that physical act of destruction has since been exempted from penalties or proceedings by the various Amnesty Acts. But the people who broke the British revenue laws in this country, particularly those relating to excess profits, are still, I think, being visited with penalties and threatened with proceedings by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In connection, first of all, with the excess profits duty, I have to refer the Minister to the report of the Revenue Commissioners, in which they say that they cannot make further assessments for excess profits duty unless, in their opinion, there has been fraud or wilful neglect on the part of the taxpayer.  That is quite emphatic and very definite.  It means that the only cases in which the Revenue Commissioners are now assessing is where, in their opinion. Irish taxpayers have been guilty of fraud or neglect.  Fraud upon whom? <Col N="627" /> Not upon Saorstát Eireann, but upon the British Government, because the excess profits duty, I believe, officially ended in August, 1921, long before the Free State was established and the Government came into office.  The point is that taxpayers are now being visited with pains and penalties because they did not pay excess profits duty to the British Government.  Whether or not there was an official declaration that the people should not pay these taxes, at any rate, there was a very general understanding that they should not be paid where it was possible to avoid paying them. It was only in circumstances where a man's business or fortune might be jeopardised by the non-payment of income tax that the payment of such income tax was connived or winked at by those responsible for guiding the Republican movement at the time.</P>
    <P>I referred last night in my speech to the methods adopted by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am informed that the real reason why these threats of penalties are held up to the taxpayer is, not so much that arrears of income tax may be collected, but that the taxpayer may offer to permit the Revenue Commissioners, in lieu of penalties with which he is threatened, to make such an extended investigation into his affairs as will permit them to come to a conclusion as to what he should have paid by way of excess profits duty to the British Government, and as to what he actually paid, and to endeavour to collect from him, not only the duty, but also the penalties for the non-payment.  I think that on the facts as I have related them, and as the excess profits duty ended finally in August, 1921, before the establishment of this State, the part of this amendment which relates to excess profits duty must be acceptable to the House and does not require any further argument to justify it.  So that whatever the Minister may have to say in regard to income tax, I certainly think that he has not a leg to stand upon so <Col N="628" /> far as excess profits duty is concerned and that the amendment, so far as it relates to that duty should be acceptable to him.</P>
    <P>In the case of the people who made wrongful returns to the British authorities in 1922 in relation to income tax, I think that what I have said in regard to excess profits duty largely applies also.  Again, you had the same circumstances: the destruction of the income tax offices, the wholesale interference with the machinery for the collection of the tax, the general belief fostered and encouraged by those who were responsible for guiding the Republican movement at the time, that it was an unpatriotic thing to pay duty or tax to the British Government whenever that could be avoided without involving the person who failed to pay in undue consequences or penalties.  In view of these facts, I think we must come to the conclusion that it is scarcely justifiable for us, even after the Treaty, to become income tax collectors for the British Government. The British ceded their claim upon the taxes, and the Minister comes along some years later and tries to collect the taxes in virtue of that cession.  But the circumstances have altogether changed.  The economic circumstances of the individuals who are called upon to pay the taxes are not at all comparable with their circumstances prior to 1921 or 1922.  Some men who were affluent between 1914 and 1922 are in comparative poverty to-day. There must be some equity in the matter, and certainly, since we did connive at the non-payment of taxes prior to 1921, I do not think that we are entitled to come six or seven years later and try to exact our pound of flesh, even though we did make a bargain with the British whereby our profits would be derived from the pound of flesh, and from no other source whatever.</P>
    <P>Whether it is expedient, even from the point of view of revenue, to endeavour to collect these taxes, is a matter that is capable of argument. Many men, warned by the fate of their neighbours, knowing <Col N="629" /> what worry is in store for them, have placed their funds abroad.  A considerable amount, I am informed by those who are in a position to judge&mdash;by bank managers and others in similar capacities&mdash;of Irish money is on deposit abroad in British banks.  The country receives practically no benefit from that.  I do not believe one-tenth of the interest upon the deposits ever comes home, because it is difficult to get it home, and when one has it, it is difficult to employ it here.  The money is lying there in British banks financing British industry, when it ought to be and could be employed with much better advantage in this country.  As well as that, on the income that it earns, small and all as it is, the Minister receives no return&mdash;he gets nothing. The Exchequer which benefits from the income earned by these Irish moneys is the British Exchequer, not the Irish Exchequer.  On the whole, if a balance were struck, it will be found that this country has lost rather than gained. Even taking the narrowest and the nearest point of view which the Minister can take regarding his own immediate difficulties, and giving no thought whatever to the future, I believe that, looking at the question in that way, and striking a balance, it will be found that on the whole the Minister has lost by the proceedings which he has adopted to collect this revenue.</P>
    <P>We think that the time has come to end that.  We think it is no longer profitable, even for the Minister, to continue these proceedings. It certainly is not profitable to the taxpayer.  There are many men in the country to-day incapable of attending to their business because of the worry which they have suffered at the hands of the Commissioners and of the Minister in their attempts to collect these taxes or to force the disclosure on the part of these men of the assets which they have abroad.  As well as that, the Minister himself, not only in his last Budget statement, but in the preceding one, admitted that the well of arrears has run dry.  That simply <Col N="630" /> means that they have, so far as any attempt to discover these assets are concerned, come to the end of their tether.  Notwithstanding all the extraordinary measures taken to locate Irish property and investments abroad, the Minister has now come to the last bone in the cupboard. There is nothing, at any rate, that his agents can discover.  He has nothing further to gain from continuing the proceedings which he has adopted during the past five or six years.  Therefore we say that, since any further proceedings are likely to be fruitless, the time has come when he might possibly change his methods. If he does change his methods and gives to these people, who are at present living admittedly an uneasy life, the chance and the opportunity to make a full disclosure, they will possibly be glad to avail of that.  When that full disclosure is made there will be available for the Minister a much larger taxable income than he has been able to make available to himself by the methods adopted up to the present.  That is the great justification which we are advancing in support of these amendments.  If the Minister will accept the principle of them, and will agree that, in justice and in equity, he has no right to attempt to collect income tax, corporation tax, sur-tax or excess profits duty in respect of any accounting period prior to 6th December, 1922, and then goes further, and says to these individuals, many of whom have been driven into wrong-doing by his attempt to collect taxes in respect of the period prior to 1922, that provided they make a full disclosure a full and complete amnesty will be granted for all the periods, and that he will only ask them to pay tax in respect of the three accounting years prior to 5th April, 1931, those who are now worried and harassed to death will be glad of the opportunity which the Minister will present to them to make a full disclosure, to set themselves right with the Commissioners, and to attend to their business unworried and unharassed.</P>
    <P>I believe that the effect of that will be that there will be, first of all, <Col N="631" /> made available for the use of industry in this country huge sums, possibly five or six millions, of Irish money at present concealed in Great Britain.  There will be made available that capital sum for the use of Irish industry and, as well as that, there will be made available for the Minister, for the purpose of assessing income tax, the income which that sum would earn.  That cannot be an inconsiderable sum.  The Minister will, as well as that, for the first time have an accurate figure as to the amount of Irish capital which is returning an investment income, and upon that basis the revenue, instead of being losers by the proposals which we submit, will be ultimately gainers&mdash;not only the revenue but, of course, the citizens as a whole.  It is because we believe that the citizens as a whole will be ultimately the gainers if these amendments which we propose are adopted, that we are proposing them, and not because we are concerned about any person who has been guilty of wilful fraud, who has been driven into fraud by courses over which he has had full and complete control, whose fraud has not been occasioned by the particular and peculiar circumstances which existed prior to 1921-22.  We propose the amendments because we think that if they are adopted the State and the community as a whole will be benefited by them.</P>

      <P>Who did not help the British to finance the war but who battened on the miseries of their own fellow-countrymen at the time. In any case, what were excess profits? They were not ordinary profits made in the ordinary way, but profits <Col N="632" /> made by that wise type of individual, the war profiteer, the man who, as I say, made hay while the sun shone.  I would have more respect in a way for the man who had invested his money in war loan at the time than the man who selfishly hoarded it up for his own special interests. If we adopt this proposal it means this, and only this, that the man who was honest enough to make his returns honestly and fairly and who paid up at the time he should pay up his tax is not to be considered at all.  But we must have consideration and pity for the individual who has succeeded up to the present in bilking the Revenue authorities of the amount that is due to them.  He has succeeded up to the present in doing that in spite of all the efforts of the Revenue authorities that we have heard so much about.

These are the people we are now asked to encourage and asked to be merciful to, people who made excess profits during the period when the going was good, and stuck on to them, and have stuck to them up to the present.  I am surprised at Deputy MacEntee.  I could quite understand the argument coming from Deputy Jasper Wolfe, but I cannot understand Deputy MacEntee's attitude that we should not have collected that money which should have been paid to the British in view of his arguments on another question and in view of his contention that we should give ourselves the benefit of every possible doubt. The position is that we took over the assets and also the liabilities, and it was mentioned.  I believe, by the Minister for Finance on previous occasions here that as a result of the taking over of the assets and liabilities <Col N="633" /> we had to make repayments from our revenue to people who made overpayments of tax to the British.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, that was what was done.  If we were not to collect income tax that was due to the British, and that we were entitled to collect from the better-off classes in the community&mdash;namely, the income taxpayers&mdash;they would have got off with a considerable amount of taxes, the revenue here would have suffered, and the people generally would have to pay it by taxation on tea, sugar, or in some other form of indirect taxation. There was a very considerable amount of arrears collected here from people who had the benefit of that money.  It was a good job that they did not pay it to the British, and if the orders issued by the old Republican Party&mdash;I will take Deputy MacEntee's word for it&mdash;had that effect it was a very good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences are all to the good.  Our revenue has benefited to a very considerable extent, and the money has been collected from people who can best afford to pay it.  Deputy MacEntee talked of the income tax collected going to the British.  He knows that that is not the position.  This money comes into our own revenue, and it is money that would have to be raised some other way if it was not raised in this particular way.  He made the plea that if a gesture was made these people would come along and make a full confession of their incorrect returns.  Deputy MacEntee has more faith in that class of individual than I have.  I have no hesitation in saying that I do not <Col N="634" /> believe that a half per cent. of them would come forward and make a disclosure of that kind.  Not a bit of them! They will make that disclosure when they are found out, and no sooner.  We have had experience of that before.  In 1922 or 1923 there was a notice published to the effect that people who had up to that time refused or failed to make returns or correct returns could make them then, and that they would be assessed on those returns. I believe that was so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I further believe that the number of people who responded to that was very small indeed, and I believe that because these are a different class, a class who are better skilled as it were in the art of concealing their profits and liabilities, and that they would have more to lose by disclosing them, even a smaller percentage of them would make any such disclosure as Deputy MacEntee suggests they would make.  It is, perhaps, difficult to discuss this without bringing in matters under another heading when we hear such language as we heard last night from Deputy MacEntee about blood money and harassed and broken men.  I think he was altogether over-painting the picture. Something like £150,000 was recovered last year.  If the Minister could give us not only the amount but some information as to amounts recovered from individual people who have been discovered in these particular transactions, I think it would be helpful.  I know of one or two cases myself where people came to me and asked me to plead with the Revenue Commissioners on their behalf, and where very considerable sums were recovered.  I would be no party to letting a person of that type get away with it, just because he happened to hide successfully from the Revenue Commissioners or the tax collectors the fact that he made these profits in the year 1921 or before 1921.  I see no justification whatever for encouraging that type of individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> The method of collection is a different matter altogether and one that we can discuss on the Revenue Commissioners Vote.  The position is that we make laws; we say that certain taxes are to be collected; we appoint certain people to collect them in a lawful way.  If they do anything that is unlawful or illegal they are liable just in the same way as any other person who would do an unlawful act would be liable.  The value of Deputy MacEntee's whole proposal would depend on the number of people who would come forward voluntarily to pay their tax or who would voluntarily withdraw their money from where they have it hidden in England or somewhere else and invest it in Irish industries for the benefit of the country.  But the particular type of individual that is concerned has not that sense of civic duty so well developed that would encourage me to believe that he is going to do any such thing.  I do not for a moment believe that it would be in the interests of the country as a whole or in the interests of the revenue as a whole that Deputy MacEntee's proposal should be adopted.  I hold very strongly that it would be a discouragement to the individual who, when the burden was laid upon him, took it up and disclosed honestly and faithfully the amount of tax he was liable for and paid it up when it was due.  It would be a discouragement to that type of man to see these particular individuals, just because they were able to hold out long enough, finally getting away with it.  It is not a popular tax.  No one wants to pay income tax if he can help it, but this would be an encouragement to people to hold out as long as they possibly could, hoping that in some way something would turn up that would relieve them from their burden.  I will certainly oppose this as strongly as I can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell says that no one likes to pay income tax. That is a wild delusion.  I know a man who lived on income tax, whose sole income was due to the existence <Col N="636" /> of income tax.  If the income tax had been abolished he would have no income.  That is an actual case.  It would be worth while giving the details. Possibly it might be better to give them more exactly than I can give them at the moment.  They amounted to this.  Just before the war a man who had a considerable collection of stocks of one kind or another deposited them with the bank and borrowed money for the purpose of buying more stocks. When the war broke out the stocks which he had bought disappeared practically in value, while some of those which he originally purchased remained good.  He had lost more on the stocks bought with the money advanced than the whole of his property. In other words he had no money in the world whatever.  He was bankrupt, but the law had been altered to the extent of preventing the transference of shares in the interval.  The result was that the bank was not able to transfer to themselves the shares which they held as security.  The income tax was deducted at the source and the bank had to certify for that income tax, and that income tax deducted at the source had to be handed back to the man, and until it was possible to transfer those shares to the bank he was in possession of an income because there was an income tax, and for no other reason whatever-So Deputy O'Connell will agree with me that even most unlikely things do occasionally happen.  I might say that this happened in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also holds a wild delusion as to the enormous benefit everybody receives from profiteering.  That was one of the biggest and wildest delusions, I think, in the world.  Here is an actual case in relation to that. During the war I was in a big ship repairing yard in Liverpool.  It was a time when ship repairs were at almost unbelievable prices.  It was cheaper really to buy a ship than to repair one.  I was in this place when a big shipowner came in and he asked whether gun metal could not be put in the place of cast iron and whether <Col N="637" /> mahogany could not be used instead of ordinary plain wood.</P>
    <P>That shows you the value that money really has, and the complete inversion of business methods which that extraordinary system of excess profits produces.  It was a wild illusion in many cases.  Take the case of a man who had made £1,000 a year pre-war and started profiteering. Deputy O'Connell is under the impression that that man was having a great time.  He was not. Of the £1,000 pre-war he probably had £900 nett.  Of the £5,000 during the war, of which £4,000 would be excess profits, he would probably pay £3,200, so that that would leave him £1,800.  He would pay another £500 of that, leaving him £1,300.  The prices of commodities went up threefold, so that he would have a net income of £400, as against £900 pre-war.</P>

So far as this amendment is concerned, broadly speaking, I have no great sympathy with people in these cases.  My line of country is directed against the methods of examination, extortion, blackmail and sabotage which the Revenue Department indulge in at the direct instigation of the Minister for Finance.  When you say to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;I have scourged you with whips and now I will scourge you with scorpions,&rdquo; they are not absolutely blind, deaf and dumb.  They respond to a delicate hint of that kind.  They can see the drift of the mind of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anything has been said that really would justify these two amendments. I think that they must be rejected because, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, they would work injustice as between one citizen and another.  That would mean that a citizen who paid would have to pay twice because somebody else did not pay, and we would be deliberately preventing the ordinary machinery from working in such a way that he would have to pay. There is some confusion in Deputy MacEntee's mind about the question of arrears.  When I spoke about arrears in the Dáil I always spoke of assessed arrears.  When I said that the well of arrears was running dry I was saying that the well of assessed arrears was running dry.  I was not saying that all income tax which remains uncollected, and that all cases in which fraud had taken place, had been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the question of assessed arrears.  Since 1923-24 we have collected income tax assessed in 1922-23 or previously, most of it previously, amounting to £5,607,000 odd.  There is still about £100,000 of arrears, which are collectable, outstanding. We have a large number of people whose income was not collected by the British from whom we have collected income tax.  We are asked in these amendments that they should have an additional burden thrown on them in order that people who either did not pay income tax or excess profits, and who, since the establishment of the Free State, defrauded the State, should not be asked to pay.  I think that it would be working a grave injustice on those who always paid since the establishment <Col N="639" /> of the Free State that they should be asked to pay again for those who did not pay.  During the coming year we expect to collect about £80,000 in excess profits duty. That would not be collectable if this amendment were passed.  We expect to collect something like £40,000 of the £100,000 assessed arrears outstanding. That would not be collectable. Other receipts, which would fail to materialise if the amendment was passed, would bring the total to, at least, a quarter of a million pounds in the present year.  That means that in order to get the revenue to ease the cases of those people who have fraudulently held on to the tax all those years we would have to put three-pence per pound on those who have always paid.  I think that that is a thing that cannot really be justified.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that penalties were being extracted from people because they made false returns to the British.  No penalties have been imposed in respect of false returns made to the British.  If penalties have been imposed they have been imposed in respect of false returns since the establishment of the Free State.  In respect of income tax, anybody who has committed fraud on the Free State can be tackled, and when a person is found to have been making fraudulent returns in respect of income tax he finds himself liable to penalties.  There are cases where people preferred to pay the maximum penalty because it was cheaper, but where they think it is cheaper to make a disclosure rather than to pay the penalties they make a disclosure.  All they are asked to pay, even in the worst cases, is a comparatively small sum in respect of false returns, and the amount of duty with interest.  In the great majority of cases, owing to the change that has taken place in circumstances, the full interest is not charged.  In many cases no interest is charged, and in a great many cases the full amount of the tax is not taken, as that would mean putting a person out of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Deputy O'Connell asked me what sort of amounts I had to deal with. I have a list here and at random I see sums of £9,000, £6,000, £20,000, £3,000, £5,000, £8,000, £10,000, £16,000, £11,000, £14,000.  That shows the position.  People are not being put out of business.  From a person who is liable for £25,000 and who can only pay £5,000 only £5,000 is taken.  What he has been asked to pay is the tax which he retained. After the Free State was established in 1923 the Government asked the people to make returns and announced that they would not be liable for any penalties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question I will give him the date.  Only a small number of people responded at that time, but a good many have responded since for various reasons.  Some people felt uneasy and were advised by accountants and others that the best thing to do was to make a full disclosure. Since then a large number of people have made a full disclosure.  It would be a very scurvy trick if people like those who answered the appeal of the Government should be asked to pay while those who made no disclosure should get off.  It would create a situation which would make income tax collection for many years to come much more difficult than it has been.  It would be something in the nature of bad faith to make people who made voluntary disclosures pay and, as I say, allow the others off.  Very large sums would be required in that case which we could not contemplate providing out of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, there are different classes of accountants.  There are accountants who assist and incite people to defraud the revenue. <Col N="641" /> There are others who do their duty fairly well but who, perhaps, would not altogether stand up against a client who wanted to defraud.  Then you have the good class of accountant who will say to his client: &ldquo;You must pay the tax,&rdquo; and who will see that there will be no monkeying with the accounts.  By these amendments you would damage the good accountants who say to their clients: &ldquo;Make your peace with the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;  You would encourage and give kudos to people who take the wrong line.  That would affect revenue administration for many years ahead.  With regard to the penalties, Deputies should remember that notices were published in 1923 fixing a date by which people had to make disclosures if they wanted to escape penalties.  In fact, the people who came entirely voluntarily since had no penalty or, perhaps, only a small nominal sum imposed. If a person came, not because his case was being inquired into&mdash;he may, of course, have anticipated that &mdash;but if he appeared to come entirely voluntarily, penalties were not insisted on, and if he paid the amount of the tax the whole matter was disposed of.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that while one may say a good deal&mdash;it comes in on another estimate&mdash;about the administration of this tax and about the point I have been raising myself as to not driving anybody out of business, the person who has been defrauding the Free State should be liable to penalties.  When he is liable to penalties, I do not think there can be any doubt that the mitigation of those penalties should be determined by the amount of money which he has withheld.  There is not much point in going back on the question of what happened before the Truce.  The people were not told not to pay.  They were told to refrain from paying as long as they could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They were certainly <Col N="642" /> given to understand by everybody in authority that the tax would be payable ultimately.  As a matter of fact, there was considerable attention devoted to the preparation of a scheme whereby people would pay their income tax into a fund established by Dáil Eireann, out of which fund compensation would be paid to those who suffered as a result of prosecution by the British.  It was found that the amount of penalties that would likely be incurred in the case of big firms would be such that compensation could not be given, and the compensation scheme was dropped. The idea was not that the people were going to get this money for themselves as a sort of patriotic penance, but that they were going to pay ultimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment by Deputy MacEntee would have peculiar effects in certain respects.  It would mean that in respect of the years up to 1925 and 1926, we would be making a present to the British Exchequer in a considerable number of cases, because double tax relief in these years can only be claimed when the assessment is made here.  In respect of the years 1926-27 and 1927-28, it would mean that the fraudulent taxpayer who was resident in the Saorstát and had no residence in Great Britain but who derived income from British investments could claim repayment of British tax and be liable to no tax at all.  There is no foundation whatever for the statement&mdash;I am quite satisfied about this&mdash;that measures like this would bring money in here.  Nothing which emerged in the investigations that have taken place&mdash;and a great number of cases have been investigated and there have been voluntary disclosures in other cases&mdash; would indicate that there are big sums on deposit in English banks. I am quite satisfied that no money worth talking about would be made available for development here as a result of this proposal.  I think Deputy O'Connell dealt with that matter quite correctly.  These people would invest their money <Col N="643" /> abroad if they were going to invest it at all.  If there are people with money in banks elsewhere, they might take it out of the banks and invest it abroad, but no benefit would be derived here.  The result would be to open up a new source of demoralisation. It would put a temptation before all sorts of people who have now made up their minds that they have got to be straight with the Revenue to try some new sort of fraud in the hope that there would be some new relief measure.  I believe it would do that and that there would be no benefit at all to the State.</P>
    <P>However people may object to it, income tax is a fair tax.  It is the only tax that has any relation to the capacity to pay.  It is unfair in so far as it is not fully collected.  It is unfair if one man pays his full rate of income tax and his neighbour escapes with half the amount he should pay.  One may discuss methods and details, but what we should have is a full collection of the tax.  If we could get that, we would get perhaps £350,000 that is not being paid&mdash;more than would enable us to give all the reliefs that Deputies are claiming.  We must bear in mind that there is not a good conscience in the country, that there is not a universal, conscientious feeling that people should pay the tax.  Large numbers of people who would never think of cheating anybody in business think nothing of going to the greatest rounds to defeat the Revenue.  The position here is largely different from the position in England.  I have spoken to many officials with experience of income tax work in England, and they say that there is the greatest difference in this respect between the two countries.  The difference is due, undoubtedly, to historic causes.  But we do not want to prolong the evils that spring from that attitude of mind.  We want rather to get people up to the point of feeling that income tax has to be paid, that those who escape it are actually imposing a burden on their neighbours, <Col N="644" /> and are doing something that, vis-a-vis their neighbour, is dishonourable. If we were now to take any steps like these, I believe we would be a very long time before we would get any improvement in the situation.  We would create grievances and make many men who came in feel that they had been very foolish and ill-advised in not holding back a bit longer.</P>
    <P>So far as administration is concerned, that is another matter.  I believe in dealing sympathetically with these old cases, and especially with cases where people have become poorer.  But we cannot tell by the amount a man complains or by the number of Deputies he visits whether his case is a hard case or not.  I had a case before me recently of a man who went to all sorts of people to get them to intercede for him.  When some facts in the case were disclosed to me, I found that, while he was being asked to pay £21,000, in addition to considerable other property, he had £50,000 in War Loan.  He was able to give a cheque for the amount without suffering in the least.  £21,000 is worth having, and he would interview a lot of people in order to stick to that amount.</P>

It is quite obvious that Deputy O'Connell's outlook on the period 1918-21 is not the same as the outlook of the people <Col N="645" /> upon these benches.  The whole principle of this amendment is directed to removing the disabilities which certain people have been placed under, due to the historic causes to which the Minister himself has referred.  Deputy O'Connell said that the acceptance of amendment 6 would be a discouragement to the individuals who paid the tax when it was due.  When was this tax for the period between 1918 and 1922, when this country declared its independence, due?  To whom was it due?  To whom was it paid by those individuals who paid it every year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  At any rate, some of the people for whom I was speaking were people who had been loyal to the First and Second Dála, who had accepted the Republican position and regarded themselves as citizens of the Irish Republic.  They did not pay income tax to the British, and afterwards, <Col N="646" /> when the tax came to be collected by the Government of the Free State they suffered undue hardship owing to the change in economic circumstances and to the change in the value of money in the meantime. That is one section of the people I had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of the profiteers in the period 1918-21, I hold that any man who withheld the Excess Profits Duty to the British at that time was, wittingly or unwittingly, performing a patriotic service&mdash;a patriotic service even looked at merely from the economic point of view.  That Excess Profits Tax was in the nature of a capital levy, considering the sort of products we were selling to the British at that time.  It was livestock which was being chiefly exported at that time. That was our main source of income. There were inflated prices then obtaining and there was an inflated currency.  The British were taking by this duty half the value of the commodity that was being sold to them.  There was very little profiteering in the matter so far as the relations between Great Britain and this country were concerned.  No man who withheld Excess Profits Duty in this country defrauded his neighbours here, however his action may have operated against the interests of the citizens of Great Britain.  He was perfectly entitled to withhold this tax, seeing that this money was going to be utilised to finance a war against the Irish Republican Government.  He was perfectly entitled to withhold every penny piece he could from the British.  If he was patriotic enough to do that and if he were sufficiently patriotic to defy the British Government even to the extent of incurring penalties, then, when circumstances changed, when the whole economic position had changed, when we had reverted to the gold standard and the value of money began to rise and prices began to fall, the State had no right to go to that man and proceed to collect from him Excess Profits Duty upon the former basis&mdash;upon the basis of the money values that prevailed <Col N="647" /> in this country between the years 1918 and 1921.  Yet, that is what the Minister is doing and that is the proceeding which Deputy O'Connell is prepared to justify.  I say that since we encouraged nonpayment of this tax, the State should have made allowance for that fact when it came to collect the tax itself, having made a bargain with the British in regard to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment 8, no person even under that amendment is going to get off scot free.  If that amendment were acepted by the Minister, it would mean that those who made a full disclosure would still have to pay income tax for the three years preceding.  The Minister will collect it for six years. Until the British Income Tax Act was amended in the year 1923, three years was the statutory period over which income tax was collectable.  If the Minister had not adopted a similar amendment to that made by the British, he could not collect tax for more than three years.  When we say that, if a person makes a full disclosure, the Minister's power to collect income tax should be limited to the three years preceding the disclosure, we are only asking the Minister to revert to the position which prevailed in this country in the year 1922.  We are not asking that the person should go scot free. We are asking that the Minister should content himself with collecting three years' income tax and assess no penalties on the man for not having made a full disclosure, and we base our case for that request on historic facts.  We say that many men enter into this course of wrongdoing by reason of the fact that they had not made disclosures to the British in the years 1918 to 1921. Having once done that, possibly some of them thought they could get away with that; some others believed if they did make the disclosure they would have to pay to the Minister the penalties for which they made themselves liable to the British, and it was that, far more than anything else, the fear that they would have to <Col N="648" /> pay to the Minister these penalties, which led those men to conceal from the Minister the full facts as to their revenue.  I think the Minister should not now mulct those people with penalties, and that he should content himself with reaping the advantage of the statute as it stood in the year when the Free State was founded.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 7:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing section or in any previous Act, Port Authorities constituted under statute will be relieved of tax under Schedule A, Case 3, of the Income Tax Act, 1918, save except as enacted in Schedule D, Case 3, of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put forward on behalf of the Cork Harbour Commissioners, who are a board constituted under statute and who are called upon to pay income tax under Schedule A, Case 3.  We suggest exemption from income tax for these boards, except as indicated in Schedule D, Case 3, namely, on income from their investments, that is to say, money which is put into a sinking fund and invested, and on which they would receive interest. That is not proposed in this amendment to be made exempt, not because we accept that this is in fact a thing on which income tax should be paid, but because we do not wish to confuse the issues or to raise a large question on a small issue.  Our contention is that the whole of the rest of the income of such a board as the Cork Harbour Board should be exempt from income tax.  The total actual net income of the board last year was £287.  The income on which we were assessed was £16,992; all the rest were expenses. The difference between the £287 and the £16,992 for which we were assessed as income was expenses. Now what we are suggesting is that expenses necessarily incurred by the board which have to be added to the cost of the services which the <Col N="649" /> board carry out is not a subject for income tax.  We think it is unjust. It involves the Commissioners in expenses to which they ought not to be put and involves those of whom the Port authorities are simply the agents in the expenses thereof.  In a statement made by the Board it is stated: &ldquo;It is a foremost desire of the Commissioners to encourage and develop manufacture and trade in the South of Ireland generally, but to facilitate this end is no easy matter for the board, as in most cases they are called on to make improvements either for handling, warehousing or dredging, involving considerable outlay, all of which is subject to taxation, or practically an addition of 1/7th on the cost.  For instance, to briefly cite a recent matter.... the firm of Messrs. Henry Ford and Son, Ltd., who are a great acquisition to the Port and the whole Saorstát, made application to have certain dredging done in or near their works to permit of large steamers coming to their wharf to ship their products.  The cost of their requirements was estimated at £1,296.  The board were unanimous in conceding the request of Messrs. Ford, but before the work was put in hands were advised by their auditor that the outlay would be an inadmissible charge against revenue for income tax purposes, which means that our board will have to pay a sum of £222 11s. 2d. to Mr. Ernest Blythe, on above outlay for facilitating shipping to the port.&rdquo; Personally, that seems to me to be pure lunacy.  Again, renewal of wharves which get worn out and are beyond economic repair is looked on as capital outlay and subject to tax.  Every single item we ask to be taken off is an item which, if it is taken off can be taken off the cost of services, and which, being put on, must be added to the cost of services. So far as the Harbour Board of Cork is concerned, and other Harbour Boards are in the same position, the Minister is actually getting income tax from their expenses.</P>
    <P>I have here in this present account a sum&mdash;it is part of the £16,992 of <Col N="650" /> expenses of which the Minister wants one-seventh&mdash;of £447.  That is cost of inquiry by Rates Advisory Committee into board's application for power to increase tonnage dues, an ordinary portion of the board's work which they would have to do. The outlay for increasing revenue is not allowable under the Income Tax Act.  In other words, if they try to find machinery by which they could provide themselves with an income to enable them to do more for commerce in the South of Ireland the cost of that effort will be regarded as income, it will not be allowed as expense.  There is a sum here of £336.  It is made up of more or less small sums.  The first is subscriptions and donations, of which £256 were disallowed for income tax purposes. If any of those charges which they have put under subscriptions is a donation which they were entitled to give, then I think it should be stopped, but certainly the method of charging income tax on it is not good.  There are several items here. £100 was given to the Western disaster in the West of Ireland, a fund of which we will all be glad to hear some detailed information in this House. Then there is the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, the Irish Nautical College and Training School, the Cobh Technical School (Nautical Class), the Lifeboat Institution, Cork Sailors' Home, Hospitals and Widows, etc.  No money of that kind that is given out by a harbour board is an income.  There are certain things they have to do.  For instance, the Western Disaster Fund is most certainly a thing which did require the support of all those engaged in shipping and commerce and in the same way the hospitals and the others.</P>
    <P>The next item is Interest on Stocks, £5,408.  The interest which the Harbour Board pay on the stock, which is the income of somebody else and which is their expense, is an income according to the present law. I need hardly tell you that that is to be added to the cost of services.  It is no more an income, as far as the <Col N="651" /> Harbour Board is concerned than I am a geranium.</P>
    <P>The next item is Income Tax, £923. The money is deducted at the source from the revenue to be paid to shareholders for the benefit of the Minister for Finance.  It might seem that was a legitimate income of his, but I suggest that £923 is also directly a charge on the cost of services, because if we were to float our loan free of income tax, free of the necessity of collecting £923 a year for the Minister for Finance, we would be able to finance our efforts by that amount less money and, therefore, for ourselves it would be cheaper.  I personally cannot see why either the £5,408 or £923 should be liable for income tax.  The next item is £242 for last year's income tax.  Our last year's income tax is income as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned. Certainly it seems to me to be an expense.  Then there is a Cork Harbour Bill, 1927, £50, which was outlay in the promotion of the Cork Harbour Bill, which stands adjourned. What could be more directly an expense of a harbour board than a Harbour Board Bill to regulate its facilities and so on?  But that is income.  For sinking fund contributions there is £3,868.  Again that is money which if it had not been paid would be available for either increasing the facilities or reducing the cost of facilities.  Every single item there is an expense.  We have £5,000 to depreciation and a great deal of that was recovered. There you have a whole series of items, every one of which is an expense. The Minister in the last debate said that he could not exempt these boards, because if he did he would have to exempt the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, at that time he had exempted the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day said that the Electricity Supply Board under its charter of 1927 was obtaining no income, was by statute prohibited from having an income, because all it paid was interest and sinking fund.  Here you have interest <Col N="652" /> and sinking fund in a precisely parallel case.  Evidently when it suits the Department interest and sinking fund are income and when it does not suit them they are expenditure.  I see no reason whatever why the actual profit of £287 in this case should be increased to a nominal profit of £16,000 when the whole of the items are made up of expenditure&mdash;provision re advisory committee, interest on stocks, income tax on these stocks, and the cost of promoting its own Bill.  All of these are regarded as revenue by the Government, but in my opinion none of them is revenue.</P>

      <P>The Ports and Harbours Tribunal took evidence in regard to the question of the taxation of harbour authorities, and they will report on that.  I do not know whether or not they will recommend any change in the present position. If they do their recommendations will be considered and, if they seem to be reasonable and fair, will be adopted.  So far as Deputy Flinn's amendment is concerned I have really nothing to add to what I said in the Budget statement.  We cannot of course, relieve one harbour authority merely; we would have to relieve others.  I do not think we could make harbour boards the only type of local authority relieved from income tax, and I pointed out that if we did relieve them on the ground that they are discharging a public service we would be driven to relieve the Electricity Supply Board, and we would be driven to exempt certain charitable organisations which are at present liable for income tax, and altogether we feel that if we were to open this matter at all we could not avoid taking the logical course and giving a series of exemptions which would, it is estimated, amount to £60,000 or £70,000 a year and possibly to a substantially larger sum later on.  The position is that, apart from any other consideration, it is not possible in this year to give concessions of the kind asked for by the Deputy.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  If any person, who was assessed and charged to tax for the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1930, in respect of income arising or accruing from securities outside Saorstát Eireann or from stocks, shares or rents in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, proves to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners in the manner provided by this section that the aggregate amount of the income so assessed was greater by more than twenty per cent. than the aggregate amount of the income actually arising or accruing to him for the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1931, from securities outside Saorstát Eireann and from stocks, shares or rents in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, he shall be entitled, on making application in the manner hereinafter provided, to have the assessment made upon him for the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1931, under the Rules (other than Rules 3 and 4) applicable to Case III. of Schedule D of the Income <Col N="654" /> Tax Act, 1918, adjusted to a sum to be computed on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the aggregate amount of his income actually arising or accruing in the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1931, from securities outside Saorstát Eireann and from stocks, shares or rents in Great Britain or Northern Ireland; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of all his other income assessable under the Rules (other than Rules 3 and 4) applicable to Case III. of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918, actually arising or accruing for the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1930, or the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1931, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who makes application under this section for adjustment of an assessment shall be entitled to repayment of such part of the tax paid by him as is equal to the difference between the amount of tax so paid and the amount which would have been payable if the assessment had in the first instance been computed under the foregoing sub-section.</P>

      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In order to remove doubts it is hereby declared and enacted that for the purpose of determining liability for assessment to and payment of income tax, the Electricity Supply Board is not and never was the State or a branch or department of the Government of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The annual value with reference to which tax is to be charged under Schedules A and B of the Income Tax Act. 1918. in respect of any tenement or hereditament in the exclusive possession or control or the occupation of the Electricity Supply Board and for the time being exempt from assessment to poor rate shall be ascertained according <Col N="655" /> to the surveys and valuations made under the Valuation Acts.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives effect to the Resolution which was before the House yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment starts with the words, &ldquo;In order to remove doubts.&rdquo;  Can the Minister tell us on what section of the Act the Electricity Supply Board are relying for their contention that there is a doubt in this matter?  Does he know under what section of the Act they claim that they are free from income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the section, but I said yesterday that their advisors were relying on the contention that they were a Department of the State, or a Department so exempt.  It would be easy to find the section for the Deputy if he requires it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With every possible respect to the Minister, it ought not to be left in this haphazard fashion.  It was said that it has always been intended that they shall be liable to income tax, but here you have a responsible body, set up by the Government, who have been satisfied that they had no power to pay income tax and they refused to do so. Surely the Minister ought to know under what section of the Act they make that claim?  He went to these people and they said, &ldquo;We are not liable.&rdquo;  Perhaps they simply took the line: &ldquo;We are not liable and you can take your own line.&rdquo;  I do not think they would.  Surely they must have indicated their position in some definite form?  There seems to be two or three places in the Act in which it is indicated that they shall not pay income tax.  I may not be relying on the right clauses, because I can tell you quite frankly that I find this measure a very complicated one to read, but Section 21 (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All charges made by the Board after the appointed day for electricity sold by it in bulk or direct to consumers and for goods sold and services rendered by it shall <Col N="656" /> be fixed at such rates and on such scales that the revenue derived in any year by the Board from such sales and services, together with its revenue (if any) in such year from other sources, will be sufficient, and only sufficient (as nearly as may be) to pay all salaries, working expenses, and other outgoings of the Board properly chargeable to income in that year.</P>
    <P>Their charges for electricity and for all other services shall be so set that their income &ldquo;shall be sufficient, and only sufficient, as nearly as possible to provide the outgoings properly chargeable to income.&rdquo; Any Deputy who has attempted to charge up income tax as &ldquo;outgoings properly chargeable to income&rdquo; knows what sort of reception he got from the Department of the Minister for Finance.  It is no use taking up every Act that we pass, and simply when the Government found that they had made a mistake, or that the intentions with which they passed the Act had changed, due to necessity, that they should simply come here with a sort of whitewash brush called &ldquo;in order to remove doubts.&rdquo; There is certainly a clear indication here that the Electricity Supply Board were not to charge for electricity or for other services an amount of money which would enable them to pay income tax.</P>
    <P>The second point at issue is the amount which is involved in this matter.  We are not concerned for the moment as to whether it is right or wrong in principle, but we want to know the amount.  Very often we put up proposals to the Minister for certain things, and he says: &ldquo;That will cost £250,000 a year, and I cannot do it,&rdquo; but if it cost only £25 a year he could do it.  That element arises here again.  If we are going to put on to electricity a cost of this kind, what is the amount of the cost we are putting on?</P>
    <P>The next difficulty I have is this: the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the Electricity Supply Board cannot have an income, <Col N="657" /> and yet we are passing a Bill to charge them income tax.  He said that in the charter of 1927, under which this Board was set up, the Board could not have been taken over by any commercial undertaking because it was not allowed to make an income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he said that it could not make a profit. Surely it must make an income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  It was not allowed to make a profit.  But it is on our profits that we pay income tax.  If this Board is prohibited by statute from making profits, why should we arrange to make it pay income tax?</P>
      <P>I want to find out whether or not the whole of the money that is paid into the exchequer of the Electricity Supply Board over and above its expenses is to be regarded as income. There will be immediately roughly nine million pounds to be dealt with by the Board.  I should say that the total revenue of the Electricity Supply Board would have to be well over a million pounds.  There would have to be, roughly speaking, £500,000 for interest and sinking fund.  Is that liable to income tax? Curiously enough, they are compelled under the Act to make an income out of selling fittings and out of installations in houses; they are not allowed to make a loss and, therefore, they must make a profit.  Is the income tax to be confined to those ancillary services, or is it to be taken on the whole of the interest and sinking fund?  These are things that the Minister has not told us.  It seems that we are going to have a good many more doubts on that point.</P>
      <P>In introducing the motion yesterday making the Electricity Supply Board liable for income tax, the Minister for Finance gave a reason for doing so which was diametrically contradicted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he introduced a Bill to-day to make the Electricity Supply Board liable for rates. The Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are quite clear that the Electricity Supply Board ought to <Col N="658" /> be liable to income tax.  In the first place, it is to a certain extent in competition with private firms.  It is in competition, for instance, with gas companies which are liable to income tax.  It is in competition with firms which are engaged in the wiring of houses and the selling of electrical appliances, which are also liable to income tax.  It has taken over a number of private concerns which are making profits to the extent of about £120,000 per annum and which are liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>We assumed that the outlook of the Executive Council as regards the Electricity Supply Board had not changed overnight, but when, in the discussion to-day with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we indicated the assumption that that was so, he flatly contradicted us and said it was nothing of the kind; that it was not in competition with these things, and it was not because it was not in competition with these things that it was being charged rates.  What are we to believe?  Will somebody remove the doubts as between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to this matter?  Are we simply going to go on building doubt upon doubt?  If I am legally advised that a thing is so, it is only necessary for the Minister for Finance to say it is not so in order automatically to alter the Act, but I may say I am advised that the income tax is going to run into a very considerable sum of money. Estimate for yourselves the income tax on £500,000.  There is the income tax on the interest and the sinking fund.  This is the first specific question I put: Is income tax going to be charged on the interest and sinking fund portion of the revenue of the Electricity Supply Board?  The second question that I put is: What other portion of the revenue of the Electricity Supply Board outside interest and sinking fund is going to be charged with it? We want to know the amount which under the Act at the present moment this Board contends, and did contend, <Col N="659" /> belonged to it, and which this House is now going to take away. We ought to have that information before we go any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest paid to the Exchequer will be allowed as an expense. The Board will pay income tax on sinking fund and on certain reserves which it will create.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that an absolutely parallel case to the one the Minister has just turned down where they allow interest on a loan to the Electricity Supply Board? They allow that as an expense in precisely the same case, the case which he himself chose as parallel. They charge the Cork Harbour Board income tax on exactly the same kind of fund.</P>

      <P>The Board do not pay that income tax, but it is regarded as part of their income because they were assessed on it and you deduct the money.  It seems to me the Minister ought carefully to consider this matter.  I do not want to press him, because I know that their minds over there are confused. Where we get two diametrically-opposite statements like the statements of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce within twenty-four hours of each other in relation to precisely the same thing we have to recognise there is a state of confusion. The whole Bill we have been dealing with confesses to a state of confusion and I suggest that the Minister should take time to clear his mind.  Surely he has some staff that can estimate what amount of liability is being put on to the Electricity Supply Board and therefore on to the cost of electricity by this Bill.  He ought to be <Col N="660" /> able to tell us that, and if he is not, he is not able to tell us anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1927, is hereby amended by the deletion of the word &lsquo;Gaelic&rsquo; now contained therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment that arises from a matter I raised on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  Section 8 of the Finance Bill of 1927 provides that &ldquo;Exemption shall be granted from tax under Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1918 in respect of so much of the income of any body of persons established for the purpose of promoting the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball or any of them as the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied has been or will be applied to such purpose.&rdquo; I suggested on the Second Reading that it was hardly correct that in our legislation discrimination of this kind should be made as between one form of game and another.  That received support from several Deputies in the House.  The Minister stated that while he was not prepared to put down an amendment himself or make any change, he did not think that he would oppose an amendment if it were put down.  That was what he told the House.  I felt that I would be meeting the wishes of many people in the House if I put down an amendment such as I am now submitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the financial effect will be very small&mdash; hardly worth counting.  It does not do any injury whatever to the Gaelic games.  It will not have that effect, but it will have the effect of giving whatever little concession is there to other forms of football as well.  I think the general principle is sound and that we ought not to make any discrimination.  In any case, the discrimination is not worth a very great deal to the Gaelic games and it will <Col N="661" /> not injure them if a similar concession is given to other forms of football.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people follow other games besides Gaelic games, and they are all taxpayers.  I think this is a case where there should be no form of discrimination.  The amendment will have no detrimental effect on Gaelic football or hurling, and handball, of course, will still be included.  I suggest the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  I do not think any one form of football should be subsidised as against another.  Because this is a free country the people should be allowed to play any form of football they like and they should get the same convenience for doing so.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy O'Connell has put forward this amendment.  He is really doing a great service to the ordinary working classes of Dublin and particularly to the children of the working classes of Dublin.  There are very large numbers of the struggling classes in the poorer districts of Dublin, and in the larger towns in the Free State, that suffer from this slight discrimination.  Various associations, leagues and clubs help each other in their financial difficulties. In remitting this tax the Minister would be really assisting all the clubs, not only the large and prosperous clubs, but the small clubs as well.  I do not think it would be in any way detrimental to the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I hope to find in years to come that a friendly spirit will exist amongst the various sections of sport.  I think that in other countries sport, and particularly football, is the bond which unites all sections of the people, but in this country within recent years it has been rather as loud as a saxophone in the jazz band of national discord.  I believe that in years to come that will gradually die down. <Col N="662" /> I think the Minister will be conferring benefits on the ordinary working class, particularly in Dublin, if he agrees to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I would leave this matter to a free vote if it were a matter in which a division was challenged.  I would just like to say a word or two on the other side of it.</P>
      <P>This concession was given first to the Gaelic games exclusively, largely for the reason that the propagation of these particular games had been, as it were, part of the movement which led to the establishment of the Free State, and, secondly, because these games of our own do suffer a handicap from being national and not international games.  Rugby clubs, for instance, do derive great assistance and benefit from the fact that we have Rugby international matches which draw very large crowds.  So far as Association football is concerned the same thing applies.  The interest in Association football is stimulated by the contests which occur not only here but outside the country.  A game that is practically confined to this country does not get the publicity or the advantages which those other games enjoy, and therefore the local or national games do labour under a certain handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree, of course, with the point of view that would make adherence to these games an article of faith or would brand a person who played another game as being a bad Irishman or anything of that sort. I do not take that point of view at all.  But without going to that extreme I feel that these games, being of necessity under a certain handicap, might well be allowed this small advantage over the others.  It was a mere concession.  In the ordinary way we would not have exempted this income from tax. The exemption from tax was given as a sort of subsidy.  As a matter of fact if we were wanting to put them all on a level the best thing would be to repeal the whole section and let them all pay because, of course, <Col N="663" /> there are objects, quite as worthy objects, in respect of which income tax has to be paid.  If it was a question of mere theoretical equality it could be achieved by putting it on; but it was taken off, not because we felt that these games should all be free from tax, but because, as regards the G.A.A., a deputation of which came to myself and to some other Minister and appealed to us to give this little concession which amounts to very little&mdash;it is only a few hundred pounds a year&mdash;we felt they did merit that consideration.  I would like the House to consider that point of view.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy with a lot of the propaganda and many of the contentions that have been brought into this question of games.  I regret them, and in speaking in opposition to this motion I am not opposing them out of that spirit.  I think that any Deputy who will consider the matter will see that the fact that the games are not played to any extent&mdash;these games are not played in England or Australia and there are no French-Irish internationals in that game&mdash;does tend to make it difficult to carry them on and does tend to throw them into the background.  Without wishing that they should be exclusively played, I feel that there are advantages in having games peculiarly of our own and that perhaps we should continue to extend some little preference to them.</P>
    <P>As I say, while I am prepared to leave the matter to an open vote, I shall myself vote against the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against the amendment, because I agree with the Minister for Finance as to the handicap under which the G.A.A. games suffered for want of international competitions, and also because I consider the games essential, or, at least, a great help towards the development of a national spirit in this country.  I am not hostile to the other games, but I do not, and I know many of my colleagues do not, <Col N="664" /> consider that the essentials of Gaelic civilisation or nationality are yet so absolutely safe in this country that we can afford to dispense with games, language, music, art, or anything else, which is Gaelic.  It is for that reason mainly that I oppose the amendment, and not in any hostility to other games.</P>

I would not be a party to interfering with any foreign games.  It is a matter for those who play games to choose what game they wish to play, but we in the Gaelic movement are entitled to some concession from a native Parliament.  We have fought to uphold the national pastimes, and it is only right that some little concession should be given to us under this Bill.  Small though it is, I believe it is highly appreciated by those connected with the G.A.A.</P>

There are quite a number of struggling clubs to whom this concession would be beneficial and it means only a few hundred pounds.  I do not think it means very much in the way of encouragement or even in the way of indication of appreciation.  The G.A.A. came along and got a concession.  I am sure they did not make the point that they ought to be given a preference as against other people.  They had a certain burden on them and they came to get relief.</P>

They got relieved of the burden, small as it was, and I am sure they would not object to this amendment. Since I raised this matter a week or ten days ago I have got no representation of any kind, and I am in touch with a good many Gaelic players, that they would object in any way if the concession which they had themselves obtained were granted to other people.

      <P>I certainly think that even Deputy Esmonde's supporters in Wexford will agree that it would be much better to give £300,000 to old age pensioners than £200 or £500 or £1,000 to a football association, because that is what it amounts to.  After all, we have to remember that the G.A.A. did establish the right to a special concession <Col N="666" /> under the Revenue laws, because when an attempt was made to impose the entertainments tax upon football clubs in this country the G.A.A. stood out against it and refused to collect the tax, when the football association for which Deputies Esmonde and O'Connell plead did not stand out.  They did not take their stand with the rest of the people, but preferred to acknowledge the right of another country to impose that tax and collect it and they willingly paid it.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but we are not dealing with that. The Association which governs the game was not prepared to take up its stand with the rest of the people. Although I am not an admirer of the G.A.A., and possibly not even an admirer of the Gaelic game, the G.A.A. have this to their credit, they did take their stand with us and, therefore, they are entitled for historical causes to some sort of concession.  If we approach this matter from the point of view of equality, I take up the position which the Minister has taken up.  I say that rather than make a general remission of tax in this matter we should impose it on them all, but at the same time another consideration enters into it.  I suppose this remission applies mainly to football games.  There are three football games&mdash;Rugby, Soccer and Gaelic.  Let us consider Soccer.  The one objection I have to the Soccer game is the spirit of pure professionalism which is extending wherever it is played throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  When a game becomes a business, then I think that game, and those who govern it and make a livelihood out of governing it, should pay income tax in the same way as any person deriving an income from any other occupation. Therefore, prima facie, so far as the Association game is concerned, I do not think, in view of the spirit of professionalism with which it is imbued, that any case could be made for its exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> Take the case of Rugby.  There, again, the great majority of clubs are well established, in wealthy circumstances and well able to pay out of the revenue they enjoy from the game.  There is no man debarred from playing Rugby by virtue of the tax imposed, but certainly the clubs should surrender some part of the profits which they derive from the public, and not all of which are used, in the Twenty-Six Counties, at any rate, to advance Rugby merely as a sport.  There have been political associations and political implications attaching to the Rugby game in the Twenty-Six Counties to which we cannot, because we are a legislative assembly, shut our eyes.  The unfortunate thing about Rugby, which I regard as the best of the games and which I would be prepared to support, is that it has had political associations and a political taint in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The thing that appeals to me in connection with it is that if you do remit any portion of the tax, so far as that game is concerned it will not all go to the advancement of sport pure and simple.</P>
    <P>The G.A.A. is not tainted with professionalism and it gets support almost entirely from the poorer sections, from the country boys throughout the length and breadth of the land, who play it because it is the one sport available on Sunday. There is very little of the professional spirit entering into it.  Therefore it does not make money.  It is not played purely or largely by the most prominent personalities as a money-making game.  Consequently, it is not played, as a rule, by the wealthier classes.  Therefore, upon these two grounds&mdash;that it is a purely amateur sport and that those who play it can ill afford to pay any money to the State&mdash;apart from historical causes, it has a right to special consideration and treatment at the hands of the Revenue authority. For these reasons, I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The opposition to Deputy O'Connell's amendment is <Col N="668" /> rather small.  I would remind the Fianna Fáil Party that a very distinguished supporter of theirs, who was a candidate for the North City at the last election, Mr. Oscar Traynor, was a very noted Association football player.  I do not believe that the Party opposite would consider that the playing of Association denationalised him in any way. We are very nervous about nationality in this country.  I do not see, when France plays Rugby without detracting from its nationality, why it should be objected to here.  There is nothing characteristically Irish about Gaelic football.  If the claim were made for hurling, I could quite understand it.  After all Gaelic football is an amalgam game and there is nothing in it characteristically Irish.</P>

      <P>I have played all the games.  Gaelic football of to-day is a comparatively modern thing.  When I was a boy, Gaelic football was not at all what it is to-day. I do not know even that there has been an improvement.  At any rate, I think we should pass this amendment, because it in no way penalises Gaelic football.  Certainly it would remove a section from the statutes that seems wantonly to discriminate against other games.  I need not remind the House that the best Irishmen are playing other games, simply as games and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this amendment moved by Deputy O'Connell.  I do so in the interests of sport generally and of health. I think that when there is an unfortunate spirit evident in some parts of the country to more or less break up sport and divide various forms of sport by barriers that it would be decidedly unfortunate if the Parliament operating for all the people, in the interests of all the people, were to discriminate in favour of some sections of athletics and against others.  The carrying of this amendment does not in any <Col N="669" /> way worsen the position of Gaelic football.  It merely, to a very slight extent, betters the position of other forms of football and we cannot forget, particularly members who have any association with the City, that the very poorest people in our cities are followers of Association football, that possibly the brightest couple of hours or the only bright couple of hours, that they have in the whole week are when they get off on Saturday afternoon to see an Association football match.</P>
      <P>The idea of this amendment is to provide a little more income for those clubs.  That income will be voted to improving the accommodation and making it a little bit more comfortable for the poorer people who follow up these games.  I think it is rather a pity that any voice should be raised against catering for athletics and catering for sport generally in the country.  It would be a different thing if the suggestion was to take anything away from Gaelic football.  It is merely to give something extra to other forms of athletics, and unquestionably athletics generally are good for the health of the individual, and, therefore, beneficial to the State.  It is only reasonable to expect the Parliament to cater for athletics and encourage athletics.  It produces both discipline and health.  I hope this amendment will be carried.</P>

      <P>I would remind the House with reference to what Deputy MacEntee said, that the Soccer Association did not support the G.A.A. in refusing to pay the tax, that there was an arrangement made through the action of the late John Redmond in the British House of Commons.  I was sorry to think that Deputy MacEntee would wish to impose a tax upon all sections of football. There is, as a matter of fact, less professionalism in Soccer football in the Irish Free State than in most countries.  I think it compares very favourably with the position as far as other countries of the world are concerned, and there are comparatively few people who make livelihoods out of it.  There are also <Col N="670" /> a few people on the staffs making livelihoods out of other forms of football, including Gaelic, so I do not think that spirit should be confined solely to the Soccer Association of the Irish Free State.  There are, I admit, a few vested interests in football in this country.  That is perhaps one of the reasons why it is difficult to bring harmony into sport at the present time, but in time those difficulties will be got over.  Class distinction has largely broken down, and, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has pointed out, the Soccer Association, which previously was looked upon as somewhat of an English and shoneen association, because of the fact that it was an English game in those days, and was played by the British Army, is now largely played by the very poor working classes of the towns.  People would hardly accuse the people of Ringsend and that section of Dublin, who are amongst the most enthusiastic supporters of the Rovers and the Shelbournes, of being excessively snobbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what the Minister said about a preference for the Gaelic Athletic Association, I personally would be quite willing that there should be an extra preference for Irish games.  I think the Government has done less than any other Government in Europe to assist athletics and the development of sport, and I would be perfectly willing and very glad to see that, for instance, the Government should give official recognition to hurling as a national game and that the All-Ireland final should be in the nature of a national holiday, with full honours from the State.  That would, I think, do a lot of good in preserving what is, after all, a very distinctive and a very remarkable national game.  Most countries have got national games.  The English have cricket, the Americans baseball, the Spanish bull-fighting, and so on.  I think that we have in hurling a very distinctive, a very remarkable and a very spectacular game which should get more support and get special preference from the Government. <Col N="671" /> But that is no reason why the Government should victimise the small clubs of other associations who are trying to struggle along.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I fear that I will have to vote against the amendment, and I want to say exactly why I will have to vote against it.  We have to consider whether we have national culture and national games or whether we have not.  If we have national culture and national games I think it <Col N="672" /> is entirely denationalising to put foreign culture and foreign games on the same level with them.  If you are going to give the same privilege to Rugby football as you are going to give to Gaelic football you are saying in effect that you have no national game of football and you are going to put Rugby football on the same level.  I think it has a denationalising influence, and for that reason I will have to vote against the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment for Deputy Gorey:</P>
      <P>Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, in respect of any article of furniture (other than a bedstead) or any component part of any article of furniture (other than a bedstead) which but for this section would be chargeable with the duty imposed by Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1925 (No. 28 of 1925), that the quantity of wood contained in such article or component part forms only an inconsiderable portion of the whole of such article or component part, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to impose, permit such article or component part to be imported without payment of the said duty or repay any such duty paid on importation.</P>
      <P>The wording of the amendment furnishes its own argument and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a matter about which representations have been made frequently. I have had it examined recently and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they could administer the Act if the amendment were adopted.  It will have the effect of removing certain anomalies.  It has sometimes happened recently that you might have an article valued for £5 but because it contained wood, even to the value of only a farthing, it would be liable to tax.  There have been articles of metal with some portion of the handle in wood and, because they were considered to be furniture partly of wood, they were liable to tax.  With this amendment adopted <Col N="674" /> it would mean that the Revenue Commissioners would have authority to exempt such article.  I think, on the whole, it is desirable that it should be done.  Large importers have been able to avoid the tax by having the wooden parts removed and having them screwed in when the article arrived.  Small importers, however, were not sufficiently well up in such matters to avoid the tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the Revenue Commissioners say &ldquo;that the quantity of wood contained in such article or component part forms only an inconsiderable portion of the whole&rdquo;?  It seems to me that the wording is somewhat vague.  The Commissioners will probably have to issue new regulations.  Take the case of a bucket of which the handle only is made of wood.  In that case would the bucket be liable to duty?  Would the Commissioners have to issue a complete schedule showing the articles only an inconsiderable portion of which is made of wood and which will be admitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen will be that instructions will be issued to officers which will probably contain a schedule, or a list of cases, in which exemption will be given&mdash;something along the lines of the phrase which the Deputy used.  They will probably state, for instance, in the case of buckets, that if the handle only is of wood they will be exempt from duty. That is the way in which it would be done.  That information will be conveyed to importers.  If any question of doubt arises the Commissioners will have to have a case submitted for their determination, and in the course of a month or two the whole matter will be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is rather loose, and is probably capable of extension beyond the limits within <Col N="675" /> which the House, in its present frame of mind, would like it to operate. The Minister indicated how the Commissioners would give effect to the amendment but, unless those were statutory rules and regulations, how do we know that cases may not arise in which the handle, though made of wood, might contain some ornament or fastening which would not be made of wood?  Instead of saying &ldquo;only an inconsiderable portion,&rdquo; there should, at least, be some definite figure laid down, say, one-fifth, one-tenth, or one-twentieth of the whole made of wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered that and found that that would present still greater difficulties.  Whether you mentioned bulk or value you would find that a fairly complicated schedule would have to be drawn up and that things which you wanted to have exempted would not be exempted and that other things were exempted.  The only thing to do is to administer it for a time.  The Commissioners will pay full attention to the word &ldquo;inconsiderable&rdquo; and will not admit any article in which the wooden part could be otherwise described.  I think that the Deputy can take it that full attention will be paid to that and that the whole matter will be dealt with quite carefully.  If, after a year or so, it is found necessary to define the matter more closely it can be done.  At the moment, when a miscellaneous mass of articles has to be dealt with, it would be difficult to lay down a proportion of say one-fifth or one-twentieth of the value of the article.  It may be impossible to determine the value but, on the other hand, if you talk of bulk you might get extraordinary results. You might have an article of which the wood might be really the valuable part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would be an &ldquo;inconsiderable portion of the whole.&rdquo;  The amendment would not exclude the case which the Minister has given, the case of an article where the wood might be an inconsiderable <Col N="676" /> portion of the whole yet, on account of the workmanship, it might be the principal feature of the article.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Commissioners, when interpreting this amendment, will bring to bear upon it a little more common sense than they do in other matters.  I wish to bring a case to the Minister's notice.  A case of cutlery was imported recently in which the case was far less valuable than the cutlery but they charged full duty on the parcel.  They charged the import furniture duty on the cutlery though if the cutlery was taken out and sent in a separate parcel they would have only charged on the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment and I am surprised that there is any objection to it.  It is a matter that has been crying for redress for many years. The amendment is, I take it, to deal with obviously unjust cases that arise, similar to those to which Deputy Goulding has referred.  I think that the border-line cases, to which Deputy MacEntee alluded, can be left to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners and of the Minister. The real injustice that has prevailed all along has been in connection with cases where the amount of wood in the article was really infinitesimal. The worst feature of it was that you never knew what was going to be made liable to duty.  I had recently an experience in connection with the importation of a portable electric lamp.  A similar parcel had come in several times free of duty.  Some revenue officer discovered, however, by removing a piece of baize at the bottom of the lamp that there was a sort of small wooden ferrule attached. It could probably be manufactured at twopence a dozen, and though the whole article was only worth about ten shillings, it was liable to duty.  I take it that it is to rectify such cases that the amendment is proposed.  Articles containing only a small portion of wood have been made liable to duty.  I <Col N="677" /> think that the proposal should have been in force years ago, and I take it that after a short time it will be found to work smoothly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> In connection with this amendment, I desire to point out that originally all hackney cars were taxed at £12 per annum, but in the Finance Act of 1926 they were charged a licence duty at the same rate as private cars with a maximum of £20. The object of the amendment is to extend the rebate of 25 per cent. to hackney cars with six seats.  I trust that the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why this concession, which was applied to old cars, was not applied to hackneys was that it was not thought desirable to encourage the employment of old cars, or cars that would soon become very old, as public-service vehicles.  We have admitted that there are certain grounds for giving the private owner who is running an old car and who suffers the disadvantage of running an old car some concession, but I do not think we should go the length of doing what would be done by this proposal &mdash;encourage a position in which old cars would be practically the sole cars employed for public service, with the disadvantages which would tend to fall more frequently to the members of the public using those cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite appreciate the Minister's point with regard to the protection of the public. But if a car is certified to be quite safe and in good order, would the Minister extend the rebate to taxis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point in connection with this question&mdash;that many of those old cars are substantially sound but may require some new parts.  The Minister would get the tax which is levied on the new parts and thereby get some slight recompense for this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not so much the concession involved; the loss would fall on the Road Fund and the duty that would be collected on parts coming in would go into the Exchequer.  This is really a question of whether we ought to encourage, as we would be <Col N="679" /> encouraging, the use of old cars, to the exclusion of new cars, in the public service.  It is not a question, either, of exposing the public to danger, because there might be some inspection system devised by which that would be avoided, but the public would be subject to delays and to uncertainty as regards arriving at their destination with the promptitude that they would be entitled to expect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4), page 6, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a person commits an offence under sub-section (1) of section 6 of the Hawkers Act, 1888, and the act constituting the offence is of such character that the proper licence within the meaning of that sub-section is a licence in respect of which the excise duty is ten pounds, such person shall incur a fine of fifty pounds over and above any other penalty (other than the fine of ten pounds mentioned in the said sub-section) to which he may be liable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> This amendment is proposed because the present penalty is simply £10.  That is because the present hawker's licence is £2.  We wish to provide that where the licence is £10 the penalty or failure to take it out will be £50.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section on which there is much difference of opinion not only on all sides of this House, but throughout the Free State.  In fact, radical differences of opinion exist.  You have town versus country, and cross currents even there, as to the advisability of such a tax.  You have differences of of opinion between local traders and dealers who come into their areas from outside.  You have differences of opinion regarding the advisability of allowing agents for foreign goods to travel around with these vans.  In certain cases, the section might lead to the abuse known as &ldquo;trucking,&rdquo; against which the Truck Act was passed.  There is no doubt that to a certain extent these travelling shops hit the towns.  Whether they are inevitable as a part of material progress, I do not know.  Whether the small towns are doomed in any case. would be also difficult to say.  At any rate, the development is there, and the Minister has already advanced reasons for this tax.  There are a few points in connection with it to which I should like to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter was raised here by Deputy Ward&mdash;the danger of infection from second-hand clothes if they are allowed to be sold throughout the country.  There should be some provision for seeing that such apparel is properly disinfected.  I have had reports from medical men &mdash;I have not had particulars of individual cases&mdash;that in certain instances appalling and shameful diseases were caused through the importation of such clothes which had not been disinfected.  If these clothes are to be sold at all, provision should be made whereby the <Col N="681" /> poor who buy them will be protected against infection.</P>
    <P>Another question that should be considered is whether booths or stalls should be allowed, on the fair or market days, in small towns at the very door of the ratepaying shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to prevent these travelling shops carrying on business, he should consider whether or not this tax is adequate.  We would like to hear if this tax is intended as a revenue tax or if the Minister thinks that a tax of £10 is going to prevent a motor travelling shop from going round the country. Is there not also the danger that the £10 tax, which is very small, will be passed on to the very poorest people who buy second-hand clothes and deal with those people who are known as &ldquo;cheap jacks&rdquo;?  These people may simply add on a halfpenny or a penny to the articles they sell and pass on the £10 to the purchaser in that way.  A tax may not, therefore, be a preventive and may not effect the purpose the Minister desires to effect.  True, some people would say there should not be interference with a service rendered to the farming community. The shops travel round to the people's houses and it is argued that they provide a proper distribution of goods and afford the same facilities to the farmers, particularly in remote places, that the people in the towns and villages enjoy. Others say that the service is not required, that the country people like&mdash;as, from my own experience, I believe they do&mdash;to go into the town to see what is going on and to hear all the news.  It is urged that this is not really a great service to them.  We should also like to hear from the Minister as to whether he favours the travelling shop that buys produce from the farmer but will not give money in return.  The farmer in some cases is obliged to take goods.  Should not the farmer be given the option of taking payment in cash?</P>
    <P>We notice that certain perishable foodstuffs are exempt, such as meat. <Col N="682" /> fruit, bread, vegetables and fish. Farmers down in Galway do not use a lot of fish nor do they use much meat, except bacon.  The Minister might state why he would not add tea and sugar to this list.  There, again, you would have the opposition of the local shopkeeper, but we would like to have the Minister's opinion on that.  They are essential foodstuffs and they are much more often a medium for barter or exchange than meat or fish or fruit. These are a few points on which we would like to have some information from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in connection with this section that is rather interesting.  £10 means nothing to any of these travelling shops that are doing a fairly good business.  It would seem as if a sort of multiple travelling shop is coming into vogue now.  Is it fair to put the same tax on the multiple shop as on the little trader who goes around trafficking in eggs, carrying a few parcels of goods and using them in trading with the farmers for eggs? It seems hardly fair to put the same tax on the two classes of dealers.</P>
      <P>I raised the point before that this tax should be left in the districts in which it is levied.  The shopkeepers in the towns are losing a considerable amount of trade.  They are less able to pay their rates and taxes than they were, and this impost, instead of being a revenue tax, should be devoted to lowering the rates which these shopkeepers have to pay. £10 is not a very large sum but, even so, if these travelling shops become more numerous it is quite possible that a fairly substantial sum would be levied in certain districts.  That sum should go to the relief of the rates on the shopkeepers in the towns.  It is not fair that it should be handed over to the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Goulding, it would not be possible to do what he suggests.  An equivalent amount of money to that collected in this way will go to the relief of rates, because it will form part of the Licence <Col N="683" /> Duties Grant, which is part of the Local Taxation Grant, which goes to the various local authorities.  A corresponding amount to that realised by the increase in this duty will go to the various county councils.  Of course, it might be collected in two counties, and it would be spread over the others just as the Licence Duties Grant is spread.  Although you cannot relate the amount that is collected in any district to the extra amount that that district will get, yet, taking the country as a whole, there will be paid out of the Exchequer to the Local Taxation Account an amount equal to the actual amount that will be received from this tax, so that the whole additional amount will be devoted to local purposes in some part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it go in relief of the county rate or in relief of the rate of the particular town affected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relief of the country rate.  I do not think the other course could be arranged.  Deputy Fahy discussed the question of the tax generally.  I explained in my Budget statement recently how we came to propose this particular tax. We had complaints about the way in which the small towns were being injured by the growth of the travelling shops and particularly by the travelling shops in motor vans. When we came to look at that matter, we found that whereas the travelling shop, which was a horse-drawn vehicle, paid the £2 tax, the travelling shop, which was a motor vehicle paid nothing.  And we at once came to the conclusion that whether or not it would be of great help to the towns that at least it was fair that the motor shop should pay something more than the horse-drawn vehicle, and we came to the conclusion that a figure of £10 in view of the extra load which a motor van could carry and the extra range it could cover was not too much.  I believe the £10 duty will tend to decrease the number of these shops to some extent.  It will to some extent remove the inequality <Col N="684" /> which exists between them and the shopkeeper who has to pay rates for his premises where the travelling shopkeeper has not to pay any, and then some small fraction of this tax will go to the shopkeeper in relief of rates.  On further consideration and really as an afterthought we decided to apply the £10 tax in this section not merely to the travelling shop but to the person whether he has a horse-drawn vehicle or motor van who sets up a pitch or stall or establishes himself in a market place or street for the purpose of selling.  I think it is really fair that a man who pays no rates and no rent should at least have some contribution levied on him.  I do not think the travelling shop which will not give money should be encouraged.  I think it should be rather discouraged.  Deputy Fahy asked why tea and sugar were excluded.  They were excluded because we were only including these articles which were perishable and of which a supply could not be taken home.  I think the majority of vans which bring around tea and sugar would also bring around other articles, not articles of food, to sell, but if those particular vans are horse-drawn they are only liable to the £2 tax as before.  One might say this is not adequate, but at any rate I do not think anyone can object to it in regard to the fact that the hawkers' licence is to be charged at the rate of £2 for horse-drawn vehicles.  It will serve to give us information as to the number and location of these shops and give us information to decide whether any further imposts should or should not be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 19 there is just one point I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to.  It will be remembered when we were <Col N="685" /> dealing with the Finance Bill last year we decided to alter the basis of assessment from three years, which had been the practice previously, to one year.  But we found during the year that certain difficulties arose under the one year assessment, and a rather important one of those difficulties was brought to the attention of the Minister.  That was where losses had been incurred in two years prior to the year of assessment, that is, the third year, and where the assessment is made on the third year the party has lost the advantage of the reduction that would have accrued if the two prior years had been taken into account.  That difficulty was met in Section 2.  We had it here before us to-day.</P>
      <P>There is a further difficulty that has arisen, and my attention has only been drawn to it in the past couple of days.  In the case of an assessment made in one year where the profits of that year are fairly large and the profits of the two preceding years are small, under our arrangement of last year where the assessment is made on the previous year it means that the taxpayer has to pay an undue burden in that particular year, because the assessment is made in one year.  Deputies will see at once the point, that if the three years' average had been taken into account the two small years would have reduced the one large year, but owing to arrangements made last year the assessment is made on the year previous.  Consequently in that case the assessment in some few instances&mdash;I do not say it applies to a large number&mdash;is an unfair burden, and I have been asked to put before the Minister that particular case to see if he cannot meet it, and if he could introduce something on the Report Stage that would meet the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point made by Deputy Good, it is particularly apposite as applied to this present year.  As a result of the work of the travelling shop and the serious drop in the price of butter, many country traders are going to have a bad year, and if their profits <Col N="686" /> are based on the profits of last year, which were fairly good, it is going to be very hard on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Any system would be hard on people whose business is going down, and Deputy Good has pointed out that it is sometimes hard on the person whose business is going up.  Someone suggested that the taxpayer should be allowed a choice as to whether he was to be charged on the basis of last year or on the average of three years, but that would have the disadvantage that the taxpayer would gain and the revenue would lose, and whatever happened it would mean a definite net loss of revenue.  If some individual hard cases were submitted to me I would consider whether anything could be done or not, but I do not feel inclined at the moment to adopt the solution of giving the taxpayer the choice because that puts him in a very favoured position.  If the old system were retained there would be some who would be better off, such as those whose income is going down. The taxpayer would pay less if he paid on the basis of the preceding year&mdash;that is to say, he would on the average.  I would only like to consider it on the basis of something like concrete cases that would be put up to the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wish to make it clear that in this debate I am not discussing, much less defending, the delinquencies of defaulting taxpayers.  I am merely discussing the delinquencies of the major offenders, the Commissioners of Revenue. I think I have already discussed that Department of the Revenue, which has for its motto: &ldquo;We care a damn neither for the Minister for Finance nor for the Executive Council,&rdquo; and that we might now usefully proceed to discuss the second great department of the Revenue, which has for its motto: &ldquo;We do not care a damn about the law.&rdquo; A very striking instance of that has occurred within the last month or two.  As Deputies are aware, there is a statute of limitations to the assessment of income tax, and it became impossible after the 4th or 5th of April last to make an assessment in respect of the year ending 5th April, 1924.  What did the Commissioners do?  Did they think for one moment they would be bound by that or any other statute?  The letter of that statute forbade them from assessing income tax more than six years due.  The spirit of that statute clearly forbade them from doing anything of the sort, but during the month of May they invented a new system of torture, and all over this country they sent hundreds of documents of a most malicious and cruel nature.  To anybody against whom they had any suspicion that any arrears of income tax were due they sent around what they call protective assessments.  They sent around assessments running into thousands of pounds, assessments illegal in their character and brutal in their results.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to let this House know whether he stands for a performance of that sort, whether the Revenue Commissioners are to <Col N="688" /> know from him that it is the considered policy of the Government that if the Statute of Limitations be placed on the assessment of income tax they can suspend that statute for all time by making these assessments and sending them out long after the appointed date and using them or not using them at any time in the future they may so desire, holding this weapon over the heads of these unfortunate people, and if he does approve of that extraordinary course of procedure.  I would be glad to know when will these unfortunate people be released from torture.  For how many years will those assessments from which they have appealed, and which have remained in most cases without any justification whatsoever, continue?  When will they be released from torture?  Will there be any statute of limitation to them, and in the case of appeals also, will it be open to the Revenue Commissioners to give those so-called protective assessments for when and so long as they please?  We were told by the Minister on another occasion in this House that he proposed setting up a departmental inquiry into the working of the office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know whether he has done that or not, or, if he has, with what result.  But I do not think that any Departmental inquiry that the Minister may set up will be viewed with any confidence in the country if the members of the committee are those who are at present administering the income tax laws.  They would, of course, find, and they would be bound to find, that they have discharged this duty fairly and equitably, but any finding of that sort would meet with no respect in the country.  In view of some of the Minister's observations to-day with regard to losses to the revenue, I would ask him to consider the loss to the revenue that the present system of income tax collection is daily causing.  If the Minister could only realise the loss to the revenue which he is permitting the Revenue Commissioners to cause, I do not think that the injustices which the taxpayers have to complain about <Col N="689" /> would be allowed to continue for one moment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that incorrect returns have been made and that they are continuing.  I am sorry to say that that is so, and so far as I am personally concerned I have done whatever I could, and I have done it since 1922 and before that, to impress upon every taxpayer that his duty is to make a full and a complete return. What answer am I to give to taxpayers?  I have had men coming to me and saying: &ldquo;I would like to increase my return by a little investment that I have across the water which brings in £200 or £300 a year that I would like to bring home.  Do you think I would be safe with the income tax?&rdquo; What answer could I, as an honest man, give to a query like that?  I know well that if any man did amend his return and showed an increased income of £200 a year, which would mean a corresponding increase to the revenue, he would expose himself to the tortures of hell at the suit of the Revenue Commissioners.  These are not individual isolated cases; they have been going on, I am sorry to say, up to the present time, and they will continue to go on until such time as the Minister for Finance will come to realise that the present methods are reducing the revenue and not increasing it.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters in connection with individual instances of what I think are hardships that I would be very glad if the Minister would listen to.  I will give him one instance which comes to me from one of the ablest of the inspectors of taxes in Dublin Castle, and I am quite certain that he would not put before me anything that was not absolutely justified.  I make no such suggestion.  I take the case of a man who up to April, 1918, was possessed of property on which he regularly paid income tax.  In April, 1918, he sold it and placed the proceeds&mdash;£2,000&mdash;on deposit receipt. For the year ended April, 1929, a sum of £45 had accumulated as interest on that deposit.  He returned that sum, with the accompanying certificate from the bank, to the <Col N="690" /> inspector of taxes.  He was assessed at £45 and he paid tax on £45.  Since then and up to April 5th last the interest was reduced from £45 to £23 owing to the fact that some of the money had been drawn out and expended on property which pays income tax separately.  He offered to pay income tax on the £23.  What is the result?  Under the law as it stands he is asked to pay income tax on a further sum of £45&mdash;that is, while he has received in all £68 income the Commissioners of Inland Revenue say to him: &ldquo;You must pay income tax on £113.&rdquo;  That may be the law, and coming from the source where I got it I do not challenge it. But surely the Commissioners have power to get relief, and if it has come to this, that if in a case where a man has received £68 and has paid, or is willing to pay, without any default or non-disclosure, income tax on the sum he receives, surely things have come to a strange pass if the Commissioners will not grant relief in respect of £45 which he did not receive and which he will not receive.</P>
    <P>I will give one other instance of the peculiar methods of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  I know a case where the profits of a lock-up business, the owners of which did not reside there, are so carefully kept that every penny that goes in is noted, every penny that goes out is noted, and a full return is made of the difference to the very penny and handed over to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  During some years there were times when the partners who owned that business and who lived at some distance away from it, did not draw their full shares of the profits until the end of the year and in consequence there were some small sums on deposit which earned interest.  To the knowledge of the inspector of taxes and without any protest from him, that interest has, for some years, been returned as portion of the profits of that business; the Commissioners have got tax under the heads of the profits of the business and of that interest, as the inspector of taxes knew, because he investigated the <Col N="691" /> accounts, the matter was fully explained to him, and the circumstances explained when the case was on appeal some time ago before the Circuit Court.  What happened?</P>
    <P>My observations have no reference to the present inspectors of taxes in the City of Cork, two of the three of whom I know are gentlemen of the highest ability and absolutely courteous and careful in the conduct of their business.  But one of these inspectors is now compelled to ask that income tax be paid twice over, even admitting that his predecessors knew that they got the tax before. I respectfully submit that, apart from any legal question that an assessment in respect of that interest should be made separately from the assessment in respect of the profits of the business, that it is not only law but fair play that when it was discovered by the Commissioners that they had already received the tax they ought not to proceed to charge it twice over by a subterfuge.  I give the Minister for Finance two instances where the Commissioners are trying to do that.  I do not in any way blame either of the inspectors of taxes who are concerned in these two cases: I simply give them as instances because these cases occurred within a very short time.</P>
    <P>Some of the other methods adopted by the inspectors of taxes are very cruel.  Without any inquiry as to whether they are right or whether they are wrong, without giving any opportunity for an explanation, they send people queries and requirements that would involve them in several hundred pounds of expense.  I will give an instance that came under my notice the other day in which, I think, as cruel a thing was done by an inspector in Dublin as I ever had experience of.  A young man had been in business from about 1912 or 1914.  In addition to his business he had got a private income, which was increased at a certain period by a legacy, and yearly sums had been coming in from that source.  Each year that man submitted full accounts of his business, <Col N="692" /> each year he submitted full accounts of his investments, and the trust fund from which he was drawing this money which was added to his income were submitted to different inspectors of taxes, to the Special Commissioners and to the Circuit Judges.  The man never withheld a thing from them. His bank books were at their disposal. He had before the Commissioners two bank books, one of them dealing with his investments.  They had full knowledge of the source from which his money came, and each year he paid the sum for which he was assessed.  He died very suddenly and very tragically.  He was lying dying in a hospital in Cork, and his wife, two days before the birth of the two children and five days before his death, was lying ill in bed, when from some source there came in to him a large sum of money, partly accumulated during the time he was ill, of about £180.  That money a kindly neighbour took and lodged in the bank on deposit receipt, in the name of the man who was dying.  Would you believe that that money, which was deposited five days before the man's death, would be made the foundation of a charge of fraud by an inspector of taxes in Dublin?</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance will stand over that?  I wonder if he will stand over it when I state that down to this day, with the facts fully and clearly before this inspector of taxes in Dublin, the Revenue Commissioners directed that this man's widow should be served with what they call a protective assessment and an additional assessment running into thousands of pounds.  Without any notice, without one word of explanation to the solicitor who was acting in the matter &mdash;and my firm was not concerned in it&mdash;this inspector writes a cruel letter, portion of which I will quote: &ldquo;I understand you are acting as executor.  I have examined the position for the past few years and I find that the deceased invested considerable sums.&rdquo;  So he did, but every sum that he invested was disclosed and explained to the inspector year <Col N="693" /> after year.  &ldquo;The sources from which these sums were obtained must be explored.&rdquo;  They were, year after year, by the inspector of taxes and by the Special Commissioners, explored by Circuit Judges and verified by the chartered accountant of the trust out of which he received the money.  Look at the torture that is put upon this poor woman and the penalty which this inspector takes on himself to impose.  &ldquo;The sources from which these sums are obtained must be explored.  Moreover, the deceased had money on deposit prior to his death....&rdquo;  I have told you the only sum of money that was on deposit to his credit at the date of his death.  Without a word of explanation he hurled that charge amounting, as the Minister for Finance will tell us, to a charge of fraud, against the dead man who knew no more about the deposit receipt than he did, and who was then lying on his death bed in the City of Cork.</P>
    <P>Here is another portion of the document: &ldquo;...with the result that such interest escaped taxation.&rdquo; Why in the name of Heaven do not inspectors, before they send out documents of this sort, go down and investigate? Why should they assume that everybody is guilty of fraud? &ldquo;The income tax position is, therefore, as you will see, unsatisfactory and must be fully examined now so as to arrive at a final settlement.&rdquo; And then the gentleman pronounces sentence&mdash;sentence in advance: &ldquo;I would suggest that you seek the services of a qualified accountant duly approved by this office.&rdquo;  She must not merely have the accountant, but he must be one who is willing to bow the knee to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.  &ldquo;I shall be glad to hear from you that you are prepared to do this, and also the name of the accountant whom you propose to employ&rdquo;&mdash;I want the Minister to listen to this&mdash;&ldquo;so that he can be suitably instructed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The unfortunate widow and orphans have got the pleasure of paying the piper, but the tune is to be called for by the Revenue Commissioners. The accounts are to be <Col N="694" /> taken up and examined by an auditor nominated by them, and we know what will happen the auditor in the event of the audit, paid for by the widow, not being satisfactory to the Revenue Commissioners.  I could burden Deputies with many cases of cruel torture of this sort.</P>
    <P>Let me show you the class of inquiries they are sending broadcast through my constituency.  This is not an isolated case; I have seen scores of them.  &ldquo;Please furnish a detailed list of your total capital as at 5th April, 1914.&rdquo;  Sixteen years later a West Cork trader was asked &ldquo;Please furnish your balance sheet as on 5th April, 1914.&rdquo;  And again; &ldquo;Please furnish a corresponding detailed list of your total capital as at 5th April, 1929.&rdquo;  Here is another request: &ldquo;Kindly give particulars of the purchase of furniture, household effects&rdquo;&mdash;cups and saucers, I suppose&mdash;&ldquo;pianos, gramophones, wireless sets, motor cars and the like in the period from 5th April, 1914, to 5th April, 1929.&rdquo; Does the Minister for Finance approve of rubbish of that sort&mdash;asking a man to send a list of every basin and every cup he has purchased, and every gramophone from 5th April, 1914, to 5th April, 1929? And here again: &ldquo;What was the total cost, estimated to the best of your ability, of the living expenses of yourself and your household for the years from 5th April, 1914, onwards to 5th April, 1929, taking into account holidays, medical and surgical expenses, if any...&rdquo;  In other words, you have to tell them what you had for breakfast, the nature of your appetite, what you had for dinner and how often you got supper over a period of fifteen years.  Queries of that sort only tend to turn the income tax into ridicule.</P>
    <P>I will give the House one more instance.  One unfortunate man placed his bank books before the inspector of taxes, and there was an examination of the books made by the inspector of taxes.  As a result of appeals that he submitted he went to the City of Cork, and it was discovered there that during a long <Col N="695" /> period he had received something like £80 interest on deposit receipts. Just like many thousands of people he had not included that directly in his returns, believing, as a great many people believe, that interest on deposit receipts was not chargeable with income tax.  But the interest which he got on the deposit receipts was included in the bank books which he showed in order to indicate the proceeds of the business on which he paid income tax.  To show the man's innocence, during that period he had repeatedly paid interest on overdrafts, and he never took credit for them as an outgoing.  He was as ignorant of one as of the other.  What happened to him?  He was put into a state of terror.  An accountant made out a bill and nobody ever could know how it was arrived at.  The poor man came home suffering from shock because he had with him a bill for something like £450, which he was to pay the next day, or he would be brought to Dublin and he would be swept for all time.  Instead of going to Dublin, however, through the kindness of a Deputy from my division the matter was placed before the Minister for Finance, who was good enough to see that it would be properly investigated.  What was the answer the man got?  He was in the inspector's office a few days later, and he was told there that he would be salted well because he had exercised his constitutional right of appealing in his deep disgust to the Minister for Finance.  They were not even satisfied with that.  The following Christmas Eve into that man's house came a messenger&mdash;an assistant from the office of the inspector of taxes&mdash;to repeat the threats they had made to him.  He told the poor man that he would have to pay doubly now what they asked him to pay before.  That was the Christmas greeting he got from the inspector of taxes.  I ask the Minister for Finance if he approves of operations of that sort?</P>
    <P>In addition to the question of income tax the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="696" /> have to deal with estate duty.  I will give you two simple instances of estate duty; they are so simple that they require no legal knowledge to understand them.  The House can judge for itself the methods of the Revenue Commissioners so far as those methods are adopted in the Estate Duty Office.  A trader dies and leaves goods which have been purchased for £500 and which could again be bought in the morning for £500.  What has he to pay estate duty on?  The deceased bought the goods for £500 and his executors could sell them for £500.  In this and in every other country, so far as I know, and I can speak for adjoining countries, the executor would be asked to pay estate duty on £500 less a reasonable discount for the re-sale if he had to get rid of the goods on the spot. What did the Revenue Commissioners hold?  They said: &ldquo;No; do not think you are going to get off with £500.  You must pay £500, plus the retail price, plus the retail profit of the goods on the assumption that you sold them over the counter, less overhead charges.&rdquo;  The value for estate duty would be the price that the stock would realise in the opinion of the Commissioners.  They are the lords of the situation.  It was explained to them that the executor could buy the goods again for £500, but they would not take that.  That is not the law in this country or in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales.  The same laws and regulations on this matter govern all these countries.  What do you think of Revenue Commissioners who have not sufficient capacity to be able to answer a simple question like that? What do you think of Commissioners who arrived at a conclusion so ridiculous and nonsensical as to tell a man that he would have to pay estate duty on a larger figure than he could buy the goods for?  Any Commissioners who come to a conclusion of that sort are unfit for their job and the quicker they are got rid of the better for all of us.</P>
    <P>I will give another instance which again will require no legal knowledge to appreciate.  If a man <Col N="697" /> domiciled in this country dies in this country but leaves property in England his executors or their representatives have to take out two grants&mdash; one in Ireland and one in England. The one in England is necessary by reason of the fact that some of the property is situate in England.  In the ordinary course, the representatives have been allowed the costs of the second grant as part of the expenses under the Finance Act, and the same Finance Act applies to England. The law in England is the law that applies to us now.  It applied to this country for something like thirty-six years&mdash;over thirty-five years, at all events.  If a man dies domiciled in England but with property in this country English estate duty will, as a matter of course, be arranged as common sense dictates.</P>
    <P>A point, however, arises as regards the expense of taking out a second grant in Ireland by reason of the fact that the man though domiciled in England would have property in Saorstát Eireann.  The Revenue Commissioners whom we now have have decided against the arrangement that I have quoted in the case of England.  They say that they are advised that no claim lies in cases such as this where a deceased person domiciled here dies possessed of assets in Great Britain and (or) Northern Ireland.  The section provides for the additional expense incurred by reason of the property being situate outside Saorstát Eireann.  This is the Commissioners' judgment: &ldquo;In cases such as this any additional expenditure incurred is not caused by reason of the property being so situate but because it is associated with property in the Saorstát in the ownership of the same person.  The costs of Probate, etc., are practically identical in all three countries and such costs are consequently not an additional expense within the meaning of the section.&rdquo;  Where is the distinction? If a man wants a second grant he has to get it by reason of the property in England&mdash;he has died domiciled in Ireland&mdash;and for no other reason.  That is the reason they have been allowing it in the <Col N="698" /> past.  That is the reason the English Estate Duty Office puts no penalty on the estate of a man who dies domiciled in England but who has property in this country.  Our Revenue Commissioners have come to that extraordinary decision, upsetting the practice and the experience of their predecessors and of their brother Commissioners across the water.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I must draw attention.  It is to these Commissioners that the vast powers are given in respect of excise penalties.  They are given powers of casting people into prison for an unlimited time. That is a very large power and I submit, for the sake of the liberty of the subject, that it should not be given to men who have shown themselves so absolutely devoid of judicial capacity as not to be able to understand that goods purchased for £500 and which can be bought again for £500 are only worth £500.  I say that it is a very grave responsibility to hand over to these Commissioners the safety and the liberty of the citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  I speak on the authority of the chief district justice of the city of Dublin who, within the last few weeks, publicly registered his protest against this.  He declared in reference to cases coming from him, on which he had brought to bear his vast experience and great legal ability, that having had before him the witnesses and heard them viva voce, when he sends the cases up to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue they are turned down.  In one case when he recommended that a penalty of £200 be reduced to £12 10s., the answer came back that the law must take its course and the man must go to jail for an unlimited time.  I could quote another instance in which the Commissioners have done something even much worse than that in respect to a memorial submitted to them which showed on the face of it that the person concerned was not merely entitled to get the penalty remitted, but that, on the facts stated and endorsed by the Justice who had decided the <Col N="699" /> case, it was shown that he had felt he had done what was wrong and that he made a mistake.  When this case came before the Commissioners of Inland Revenue with a recommendation that the penalty of £25 should be reduced to 10s., or wiped out altogether, the Commissioners sent it back with the usual stereotyped answer that the law must take its course.</P>
    <P>That power had to be taken away from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in England over 50 years ago, at all events to some extent.  At that time a law was passed to give the then justices in England power to limit the period of imprisonment. Unfortunately, that law was never extended to this country and the Commissioners here still have this power which they are wielding in this awful fashion and the sooner it is taken away from them the better for the security of the citizens.  In conclusion, I would beg the Minister for Finance to consider the capability of the existing Revenue Commissioners to carry on and discharge the very serious functions entrusted to them, and if he finds himself forced to the opinion that everybody else in this country has been forced to long ago, that they are unfit and unable to discharge their duties properly, that he will not hesitate to say so, and, if necessary, will clean out the Augean stable.</P>

      <P>It requires a certain amount of courage to stand up and say a word for that unpopular individual, the tax gatherer.  It is not to-day or yesterday that the tax-gatherer became unpopular. There is, however, one point of view from which we, as a Parliament, should look at this.  I was interested in watching the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches while Deputy Wolfe was engaged in his onslaught on the Commissioners, and I could almost pick out the large taxpayers from the expression on their faces while the Commissioners were catching it from the Deputy.  I noticed how appreciative Deputies McDonogh, Leonard, John White, and those <Col N="700" /> others were of what Deputy Wolfe was saying.  I am sure that they have had reason to complain of the tax-gatherer now and again.</P>
      <P>I should like that we should approach this question in this way: we imposed these taxes in Parliament. We imposed them for the general purposes of the country and to carry on the services of the country. They were imposed after discussion and consideration by Parliament. I thoroughly agree with what the Minister said to-day, that income tax is, all things considered, the fairest form of tax.  A direct tax of this kind falls most fairly on the individual taxpayer.  It is only unfair if it is unfairly collected&mdash;if some people have to pay to the fullest and others are able, by one means or another, to get away from their responsibilities.  I believe with him that there are quite a number of individuals&mdash;and there were a greater number in the past&mdash;generally the better-off and more well-to-do individuals, who do not discharge their full responsibilities in the matter of income tax.  I believe that it is the smaller taxpayer, the wage earner, or the man in a salaried position, who bears to the last penny his share of the tax and that there are a great many people engaged in business who are not discharging their full liabilities in the matter of income tax, and the more extensive their business the greater is the chance that they are not discharging their full liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we impose the tax and we appoint Revenue Commissioners to collect it for the Government of the country.  We lay down rules and regulations within which they are to act.  We frame laws for them. They have no right, I take it, to out-step those laws.  If they do, they are committing illegalities and can be arraigned before a court, just as any other person who breaks the law may be arraigned.  If these terrible things are being done, if these illegalities are being committed, if the law is being broken to the extent which Deputy Wolfe would have us believe, how is it that these <Col N="701" /> people have not long before this being taken before some court or other and punished for law breaking? I am sure that a man of Deputy Wolfe's trained legal mind and ability would not be incapable of discovering some method by which the Revenue Commissioners or Income Tax Inspectors could be arraigned and prosecuted before a court if they were outstepping the law.  If the law is bad, then we cannot blame the Commissioners for acting within the law that has been made or adapted here.  It is the Parliament here that must be blamed in that case.  It is our duty to make the laws; it is the Commissioners' duty to act within the law framed for them.  If it can be shown that they have outstepped it, then they have acted illegally and should be dealt with for having so acted.</P>
    <P>The cases that Deputy Wolfe cited here undoubtedly would appear, on hearing them first, to be instances of very great hardship&mdash; some of them in any case.  But one must remember that Deputy Wolfe in his profession is used to advocacy, to putting the high lights, as it were, of the particular case he was pleading in the best possible way before his hearers.  He can hardly expect those who listened to him to form an independent and unprejudiced judgment on the statement he has made and on the cases put forward unless we had a full opportunity of hearing the other side.  I do not know that we can have that opportunity of hearing the other side in the way that I should like to hear it.  I do not believe it is possible for the Minister to take up any of the cases which the Deputy mentioned and give the full facts on the other side&mdash;possibly he does not know them.  In any case, one must remember that there will always be a certain amount of prejudice in favour of the man who is called upon to pay.  I often ask myself in dealing with these things and hearing of the terrible actions and harshness of the Revenue Commissioners or Income Tax Inspectors, why should they do it; what is the <Col N="702" /> motive behind their action?  What possible motive can there be for their acting in the way it is alleged they have been acting?  They gain nothing by it themselves.  Their salary is not increased; they are not working on a commission basis, and they are making themselves frightfully unpopular.  What could be the motive behind their efforts unless the very simple one of doing what they believe to be their duty? We must not take it for granted that we have a special type of individuals who take a particular delight in the class of treatment that Deputy Wolfe has so eloquently described.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any reason why we should accept that. As I said earlier to-day, no one wishes to pay income tax.  It is not a popular thing to do.  But we have to take the broad view, and I can quite conceive, human nature being what it is, that there will be always a tendency on the part of those who have to pay tax to evade payment, more especially on the part of those who have, through fraud or wilful neglect, failed to pay.  There will be always a tendency on the part of such people to stop at nothing to get out of their obligations.  They will use every possible kind of influence, political and otherwise, to get out of their obligations.  I think we should remember, generally speaking, that the class of people that are under consideration are not the small taxpayers who owe a £1, £2, or even £15, but people who are liable to pay in hundreds or thousands, and that for every thousand pounds that fails to be paid in that way the poorer taxpayer, who pays generally through indirect taxation, will have to make that sum good, if the services of the country are to be carried on in the way in which we should wish them to be carried on.  That is something we ought not to forget.  If the tax is a fair one, and if it is proposed here that every person ought to pay, I do not sympathise for a moment with any attempt, if there have been such attempts, to act harshly, unfairly, or without sympathy.  I am a strong believer in sympathetic administration. <Col N="703" /> I do not approve of harsh administration of the law. Where discretion can be used, I believe it should be used sympathetically. At the same time, it must be remembered that if we impose a duty on certain individuals to collect that tax, what is after all an unpleasant duty, we ought not to be in a hurry to hamper them in the execution of the unpleasant duty which we have so imposed upon them.  We ought to be very sure that they are acting in a harsh and unfair manner before we use such terms as Deputy MacEntee used here last night when he spoke of the &ldquo;blood money&rdquo; that was being paid by harassed and broken men.  We heard some of the sums mentioned by the Minister for Finance to-day, some of &ldquo;the blood money&rdquo; that had been got from these harassed and broken men, sums of £10,000 and £15,000.  I could not help thinking that Deputy MacEntee was painting the picture a little too much altogether.</P>
    <P>I must say that while I am not surprised at Deputy Wolfe taking up the attitude he did, I certainly must confess to some surprise at Deputy MacEntee, who may himself be in the position of being responsible for the collection of tax in the near future. I was surprised that he should take up that attitude and thus by his action give encouragement to those who would be tempted&mdash;and the temptation is very strong&mdash;to put difficulties in the way of the collection of taxes from them.  I think it is wrong that any encouragement should be given to the evasion of tax or that it should be felt by those who should discharge their duties that there was any considerable volume of support for them in their efforts to escape the responsibility that has been placed upon them by this House.  I believe that the more that particular class of taxpayer escapes his responsibilities the greater will be the burden that will be placed on the poorer classes of the community if the services of the country are to be carried on.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell asked why it was that when we laid <Col N="704" /> down the laws that the Revenue Commissioners took up the attitude that they did.  Is their attitude, as we contend, so harsh and tricky in the interpretation of the law?  We submit that it is and the reason of it is to be found in the fact that we have got away from the constitutional habit of mind of English administrators of the law and drifted into an attitude of mind which is purely bureaucratic.  We have dropped the system of special commissioners, consisting of ordinary laymen, and adopted the system purely of civil servants, persons who are removed from the ordinary course of everyday life and whose sole object is to collect as much revenue as possible.  Their zeal outweighs their sense of citizenship.  The State has not yet got that sense of the application of the principles of constitutionalism which are required even for the purpose of collecting income tax.</P>

      <P>His attitude, or rather the attitude of Deputy O'Connell, reminds me of the attitude which he took up on another occasion in the case of George Gilmore, when the implication was that he was an outlaw. The attitude towards the income taxpayer appears to be that if he is costive in paying his income tax he is to be regarded, if not as an outlaw, as some one who is not entitled to the full measure of fairness or equity.  He has to be got after one way or another.</P>

      <P>They are the victims of the law and they are even more so the victims of their own interpretation of the law.  We hope to save them from themselves and I am afraid also from the law as at present constituted, because certainly this debate has revealed the fact that there are flaws in the law which naturally cannot be dealt with on this Vote.  It may be put in this way that at present they are in a very difficult position because they know that they may be committing a breach of Article 64 of the Constitution, on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is their duty to carry out the law as they see it before them.  The whole position needs to be cleared up.  It becomes very obvious to the lay mind that judicial functions are being exercised by a certain body of officials, that it is in their power and part of their duty to decide whether a man has committed fraud or not. Obviously that is a judicial act. That is an extreme case, and it makes it clear that at some point or other a body must be constituted with the power and responsibility of judges to decide questions like that. So it may be concluded that part of the fault which is placed at the door of the Revenue Commissioners at present is due to the undefined and defective condition of the law. Of course, there is a considerable lack of common sense in the application of the law.  I think that Deputy Wolfe has proved that in the case of the goods worth £500.  Another very unreasonable instance.  I think, was where a bishop made a certain claim for a certain outlay connected with his office and the Commissioners would not allow the claim.  He had to pay his income tax, no regard being paid to that particular outlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell says &ldquo;like any man.&rdquo;  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that he should pay &ldquo;like any man&rdquo; and because he was a bishop and in what might be called in a sense an ornamental position, he <Col N="706" /> should not be excused where any other man would not be excused.

      <P>The matter which was the subject of a question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce by me to-day, has been raised for the sole purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of informing the House and the country what he has done so far to bring together the contending parties in the dispute.  At the outset I want to dissociate myself and the members of my party, and also the trade union, of which the strikers are members, from any armed attacks that may have taken place on 'buses of the Irish Omnibus Company.  The union of which the strikers are members has repeatedly advised the men to conduct the strike on the ordinary lines of peaceful picketing.  Strange as it may appear, that does not seem to be the attitude of the opposite side.  I have here a weapon, a baton, I suppose, one would call it, which was captured from a strikebreaker in Limerick a few days ago. It was his reply to those on strike when they asked him to join them. I would invite the Minister for Justice in particular to examine this dangerous weapon, and to see if it has any resemblance to the official weapons which have been used from time to time&mdash;I am glad to say, not recently&mdash;for the purpose of batoning the public when the necessity arises.  I produce that weapon in order to show that the people who are a party to the strike on the other side are not apparently encouraging the strike-breakers to conduct the strike on peaceful lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions, both here and outside.  I raised the question of the failure of the Minister and the Government to regulate and control the railway transport services. In doing so, I pointed out that the employees of the 'bus companies, and particularly those of this <Col N="707" /> company, have been brought before the courts and fined, and rightly so, for overcrowding or exceeding the speed limit laid down by law.</P>
    <P>I quoted one case of a driver named Donnelly who, inside a period of four months, was fined on six occasions for exceeding the speed limit. He was forced by officials of the company to exceed the speed limit, because he was given only a certain time to do the journey from Dublin to Sligo.  In order to carry out these orders he was obliged to exceed the speed limit.</P>

The company forced this badly-paid driver to agree to deductions being made from his wages to meet the amount of the fines, and when the individual thought fit to go to his union about the matter, he was instantly transferred to another area where it would be impossible for him to carry on his work with the company, as he was a married man with four children, so that his transfer was tantamount to an indirect dismissal.</P>

When the Deputy gave notice in regard to this matter the Ceann Comhairle stated clearly the practice adopted here in regard to trade disputes and mentioned that in almost every case it is the practice of the Minister's Department to carry on arbitration proceedings and to endeavour to get the parties together.  That is the extent to which the Minister is involved here and, clearly, we cannot have a discussion on the merits.  The more we discuss them the less likelihood is there of the Minister carrying out the functions which are his.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, Sir Walter Nugent, at the last general meeting of the shareholders stated, and it was published in the Press, that £85,000 of the paid-up capital of the company was owned by the shareholders of the Great Southern Company.</P>

      <P>Three of the four directors of the bus company are directors of the Great Southern Company.  In a dispute in which the same union was involved in 1929, namely, the railway shops dispute, in which the shop workers of the Great Southern Company were involved, the Minister went so far&mdash; I invite contradiction on this&mdash;as to invite both parties to submit the matter to arbitration.  He had some reason, I understand, to think or suspect that the union which represented the shop men was not disposed to accept arbitration.  He delivered an ultimatum to the members of the same union to the effect that if they did not submit to arbitration in a short period he would proclaim his position to the country and justify his position in trying to force them to adopt arbitration. Now, what is he going to do in this particular ease?  That is the only reason which I have to offer for putting the question on the Order Paper to-day.  I hope that the Minister <Col N="710" /> will explain his attitude up to the present from that point of view.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I would like him, if he is taking steps to bring about a meeting of the parties, to bear in mind the fact that the members of the union, for whom Deputy Davin has been speaking, and the drivers of the omnibuses have been engaged for many years in pirating passengers after hours in Dublin.  I mention that in view of the fact that the Taxicab Owners and Drivers' Association have suffered considerable losses as a result of that illegal and irregular poaching by bus drivers in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The House and the country would like to hear from the Minister what efforts he has taken, within the powers vested in him and his Department, to bring about a settlement or to get the parties together.  Everybody knows that the dispute is detrimental to the interests of the country and may lead to further and greater trouble. We are particularly anxious to know what the Minister has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That last point is the only one that I can answer.  I have mentioned that the reason that I did not take steps to meet the company was that I had no compulsory powers.  Deputy O'Connell wants to know what I have done within my limit of powers.  The only power I have is to invite both parties to come together.  I invited both parties to come together more than once and I can do no more.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say whether it is a fact that in the railway shops dispute he threatened the men with arbitration and stated that he would justify his position before the country in forcing them to accept arbitration?  Is the Minister prepared now to adopt the same attitude towards the directors of this company, seeing that the men have accepted his invitation?</P>

      <P>I do not remember exactly what took place on that occasion.  There was an occasion on which a statement was addressed to both parties to the effect that unless both parties met in conference I <Col N="712" /> would publish the fact that I had invited both parties and that I would let each party, or whichever party did not attend, justify its action to the public.  I only say the same thing has now been done.  It has been promulgated. The parties have been invited and one party has refused to come.</P>
