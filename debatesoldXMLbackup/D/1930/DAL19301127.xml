      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will restore to Eoghan Mac Suibhne, General Register Office, his previous service in the Post Office, and his period of enforced absence from July, 1922, to February, 1928, towards salary, pension, promotion and seniority in his present appointment.</P>

      <P>Mr. Eoghan Mac Suibhne's established service in the Post Office will, as he was informed before re-employment, count for pension.  There is no adequate reason for varying the terms and conditions of appointment in his present grade which were communicated to Mr. Mac Suibhne in a letter dated 12th January, 1928, and which were accepted by him in writing before being re-employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing law the Government have no powers to prohibit the importation of foreign malt into the Saorstát, and it is not intended to approach the Oireachtas for the grant of such powers in view of the fact that malt is the raw material for the important industry of brewing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed. No fracas of the type suggested by him took place.  Some members of the Gárda Síochána were, however, on the hotel premises on the 6th instant (not the 11th, as suggested in the question).  A revolver accidentally fell upon the floor and discharged, and Mr. Cullen was wounded in the ankle.

      <P>There is a difference between dismissal and discharge.  He was not dismissed; he was discharged. The Executive Council did not take the view that this act was of itself sufficient to warrant dismissal.  In certain cases officers lower down in the service have been found to be indebted to subordinates.  In their cases what was done was the officer was degraded, his increment was stopped or he was, for instance, debarred from promotion.  It was felt in this case that none of these forms of punishment <Col N="576" /> would be suitable, and the Executive Council felt that the official must be discharged from the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several Bills on this list the subject-matters of which, I think, could have been dealt with since a similar Bill of the kind was passed, but there is one in particular that is, to my mind, a rather urgent matter, and that is the Motor Car Act.  The subject matter of that Act has been, I think, discussed here in this House.  There have been inquiries about it, and promises have been made by the Government to have a Bill introduced to bring this legislation up to date.  I think the promises have been repeated, and notwithstanding the promises we are still without the Bill.  There are many people who think that this matter is an urgent one.  The subject of motoring and the regulations that are necessary with regard to it are not at all up-to-date. <Col N="578" /> The regulations in general governing the conduct of motorists and motor traction in general are not what they should be, and they are not by any means as up-to-date as such legislation is in neighbouring countries.  One item alone is brought out in the summary issued by the Department of Local Government.  Under this section a person is prohibited from driving a motor car on a public road at a speed exceeding 20 miles an hour.</P>
      <P>I wonder what Deputy in this House who has a motor car obeys that section of the Act.  That one section alone is indicative of the state of legislation on the subject of motoring. There are some people on this side who think the matter is urgent and believe that despite the fact that the Ministry is engaged in bringing in a lot of legislation in view of an early general election that this question of the laws relating to motoring is a very urgent one and that perhaps some of the popular legislation that might suit between now and the date of the general election to encourage people to look more favourably on Cumann na nGaedheal candidates might be left aside, and that any measures of an urgent nature such as this question of motor legislation should be given precedence. I think unless the Minister can give us a guarantee that an early opportunity will be taken to keep the promise made to introduce legislation dealing with this matter we must vote against the Bill as a whole.  We cannot vote against that particular item on the schedule, and as we cannot do that, unless we get some satisfactory explanation or promise that this legislation will be introduced we will have to vote against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I call attention to the fact that last year the Minister deprecated any criticism of this Motor Car Act when the Expiring Laws Bill was going through the House?  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To attempt to discuss small points in traffic administration without adequate notice is very difficult, and, I suggest, on the eve of the introduction of a Bill which will codify and put into satisfactory condition our traffic law based on modern conditions <Col N="579" /> and on the consideration that has been given to the matter by the Traffic Committee, would not be very profitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it were not for that promise a number of the Deputies on this side of the House would have insisted on proposing amendments to this particular Act, because it was felt that the whole position in regard to road traffic was very urgently in need of review and amendment.  It will be remembered that some time after that the Minister introduced a Road Traffic Bill, and when we resumed in the spring he asked leave to withdraw it as he was not prepared to go on.  It is very extraordinary now that he comes along and asks us to approve of the same Act of 1923 still being continued in force and makes no mention of when he will be ready with this new legislation.</P>
    <P>He must surely admit that there is a crying demand for such legislation and that there is urgent need for it. There have been a number of shocking accidents, largely due to the lack of regulations.  He must admit, too, that there is a growing increase in bus traffic in the Saorstát, and it is not too much to say, both from the point of view of the passengers in these public vehicles and from the point of view of people using the roads, there is hourly danger of the loss of life through the lack of Government regulations. In many cases I know that parents living near the roadside are in perpetual worry as to the fate of their children.  There have been cases where parents avoided sending their children to school because they were afraid of the fate they would encounter through these public vehicles not being under proper control.  In face of all that, I think Deputy O'Kelly's proposal is a wise one, that the House should not allow this Bill to go through without a definite statement from the Minister as to the exact date when the new Traffic Bill will be brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to urge on the Minister the necessity of taking some steps to deal with this problem. Deputy O'Kelly has pointed out that <Col N="580" /> at present a motor car cannot exceed 20 miles an hour without breaking the law.  Might I remind the Minister that that is not one of the worst flaws in the existing Act?  As I understand the existing Act, a blind man can apply for a licence to drive a motor car, and there are no powers to refuse him.</P>

      <P>If Deputies were a bit more explicit as to the matters which require to be remedied than they have been in the discussion here we might see whether under the existing regulations we could not do something to meet them.  Before Christmas of last year I did ask for permission to introduce a Traffic Bill.  When the Dáil met again in the spring to discuss legislation, I found that I was not able to get the Bill drafted in time to have a Second Reading then and I asked for permission to withdraw the Bill.  The reason for the delay in the introduction of the measure is not because of any lack of effort on the part of the Department of Local Government or of the other Departments concerned in the matter.</P>
      <P>Legislation dealing with traffic involves a number of Departments, and it involves the public in quite a number of different ways.  I still hope to be able to introduce a Traffic Bill before Christmas so that the Dáil can discuss it in the spring.  I do not hold that out as an invitation to Deputies on the opposite side or to any Deputies in the House to restrain their criticism.  When I objected to criticism both on the Combined Purchasing Act and on the Traffic Act here last year I objected to Deputies raising points of detailed criticism on these matters on the Expiring Laws Bill when they could be much more effectively raised in a different way. Many of thorn could be much more. satisfactorily raised and dealt with by representations to the Department without taking up the time of the House here at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> All that I can say with regard to the Traffic Bill is that I on my part and the various Departments concerned are doing our best to get the proposed measure into such shape that we can put it into the hands of Deputies before Christmas.  The drafting of the measure is very far advanced, but there are some outstanding points that are of importance, and because they are intricate they had much better be hammered out between the different Departments concerned. It had much better be done that way than throw a measure half prepared, on certain points at any rate, into the discussion of this House. It would take up much more time in discussion and perhaps arrive at a less satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>There will be nothing in the Traffic Bill, as far as I know, that will prevent children wandering on the roads and being rolled over if they are wandering carelessly.  Deputy Moore seems to think there is something radically wrong in our legislation dealing with traffic and, because of that radical difficulty, persons who are driving buses and driving motor cars are endangering the lives of children on the roads in a way in which they would not endanger them if proper legislation were introduced.</P>

      <P>At the first meeting of the Dáil this year the Minister withdrew a Bill which was introduced last December.  He said then the difficulty was that the Executive Council had not an opportunity of considering its policy in relation to many matters arising out of the Bill.  He said the Bill would be reintroduced before the Summer Recess.  Is his promise now of any greater value than the promise he made last March?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that an inter-Departmental committee was established.  It went into this matter in great detail and submitted a report in 1928 as a result of which a Bill was introduced in 1929.  That Bill was withdrawn in 1930 and there was a promise that it would be reintroduced in June, 1930.  It was not reintroduced. It is once more promised for December, 1930, and in all probability it will not be introduced then either.  It seems to me the Government are not taking this matter seriously. The Minister's attempt to contend that the non-introduction of the measure is having no effect on the number of accidents caused daily will convince nobody.  There are on the average four people killed every week in this country in consequence of motor accidents.  Is it seriously contended that a large number of accidents are not due to the fact that there are people driving cars who have been convicted of reckless driving or of driving under the influence of drink? Secondly, there is the important point that cyclists are not required to have rere lights on bicycles after dark, and persons driving cattle are not required to carry lights to indicate the position of the animals.  Numbers of other matters were dealt with by the committee in its report.  All these things could be dealt with by way of legislation and no great question of policy arises in connection with them.  I believe that there is no reason for delaying this measure other than the laziness of the Department of Local Government.  Arising out of the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920, which is also being continued, I would like to be informed how soon will legislation following on the report of the Port and Harbours Tribunal be introduced.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not treat the question of a driver's licence as he would appear to have treated it this afternoon when it was raised by Deputy Good.  I would like to add something to what Deputy Good said about blind men getting licences. I believe that some years ago an elephant in the Zoo got a licence to drive a motor car.  That happened in the case of Jumbo, the famous elephant in the London Zoo, and the licence was taken out in order to test the matter.  We are working under the same Act.  I have an experience of twenty-five years in driving motor cars.  Twenty-five years ago it was expected <Col N="585" /> that the law would be amended at once, but it is still unamended.  It went so far that the Royal Irish Constabulary started testing drivers so that they might carry on when the new Act would come in.</P>

      <P>One of the futilities which is a general belief in this House is that the Minister will not tolerate questions on matters upon which we are entitled to ask questions.  He seems to have a completely wrong conception of the duties of Deputies.  When matters are put forward in detailed form he declares that he has had no notice.  Here is a Bill that has come before us to-day, and surely he should have full information now on the subject of that Bill. Yet, when matters of detail are put to the Minister he lectures us like schoolboys in a most offensive manner.  The instances mentioned here to-day were simply instances of defects and anomalies which are making traffic so dangerous. As a matter of fact, in some parts of the country the people are so terrorised by motor cars that you will see the unfortunate people with their donkey carts driven up on the ditches. This terror is created by some of the larger vehicles.  For that reason it is full time that this Bill was introduced. The Minister, by his neglect of this matter, is making himself responsible for the casualties which are at present occurring on the roads of the country. It will not do for him to get up in this House with a stiff back and lecture members of this House who represent hundreds of thousands of electors of this country, and tell them that they have no right to ask questions on this matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply to the question raised by Deputy Davin.  It was with the idea of conveniencing the House that I asked permission for the introduction of this measure before last Christmas, because there was in my opinion sufficient work done and sufficient decisions taken to hope that it might be possible to get the draft of the Bill put into the hands of the Deputies in the Spring.  That hope did not materialise.  I think the House will understand that desirability in order that the Bill may be fully studied before the Second Reading after the adjournment.  It is for that reason that I wanted the First Reading taken, even though the Minister is not able to place the Bill actually in the hands of Deputies on the morrow of the introduction of the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether we are going to have any sort of permanent legislation in connection with the county schemes. The position at the moment is certainly very unsatisfactory.  As one who voted for the amalgamation of the Unions in the old days in the time of the first Dáil I must say that I am certainly very much disappointed with <Col N="587" /> the arrangements made from time to time by the Minister.  I think it was clearly understood by anybody who had anything to do with the amalgamation in 1920 that it was the intention of the Ministry to have accommodation for fever patients in more than one town in a county.  The position in Wexford is certainly very serious.  The County Fever Hospital under the original scheme was situated at Wexford.  Since then it has been transferred to New Ross.  I think the Minister will agree when I say that a town with 12,000 inhabitants should not be left without a Fever Hospital. Certainly patients should not have to be transferred to an hospital twenty-five miles away.  Further, Wexford is a seaport town and the inhabitants there are consequently in more danger of contracting fever than in an inland town, by reason of the fact that there is a good deal of sea traffic day after day.</P>
      <P>I do hope that the Minister will apply himself to a situation of that kind and that he will not allow anything permanent to be done in connection with the establishment of hospitals until we have permanent legislation. I have always advocated that, so far as Wexford is concerned, we should have a fever hospital in our seaport town, and I think that should apply in every case, because medical opinion will, I think, agree when I say that a person who has a high temperature should not be dragged around the country in a motor car, because such persons are more susceptible to colds and pneumonia when the temperature is high.  I would ask the Minister to apply himself to that side of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, is another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. Under the Labourers (Ireland) Act, there are improvement schemes for providing houses for agricultural labourers.  I would like to know from the Minister what his intentions are, so far as the building of houses in rural areas is concerned. Since the start of the war in 1914 very few houses were built, and while the Minister may say that there is not the same need for houses in rural Ireland <Col N="588" /> as there is in urban Ireland, I would say that that may apply to isolated cases.  There are a great number of large villages and small villages, too, in the various counties in the Saorstát, where housing is as bad as, if not worse than, in the urban centres.  I think that the Minister should do something now in an endeavour to secure that houses will be built in these areas.  Some county boards of health have been crying out for the same terms to deal with houses as are given elsewhere&mdash;an extension of the Local Loans Fund.  I would like to take this opportunity to point out that that would not be sufficient for these areas, that something more would have to be done, and that the county boards of health that are asking for these powers to be conferred on them are not asking for sufficient and do not realise what they are up against.  I would ask the Minister if anything has been done in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question of the poor law I said in my statement last year that the Department was concerning itself with the codification of the poor law principally to convenience local bodies and officials of local bodies in dealing with the law.  There is nothing in the point which Deputy Corish raised as to the institutions here and there that cannot be dealt with under the present system, because the county scheme can be changed by order.  Without encouraging a discussion of detailed points in connection with this measure, I may mention that hospital accommodation in Wexford is a matter that has been under review by my Department.  It is a question of arrangement between the Department and local bodies as to what kind of arrangement will be established there.  What we are doing under the Labourers Acts here is: we are deciding whether the laws that are the foundation of our Labourers Acts, and that have been permanent for 29 years or more, will be kept so as to enable us to deal with houses for labourers in rural areas on the lines on which we are dealing with them.  Whether we are going to change any part of our policy in respect of rural housing is not a question that I am prepared to discuss <Col N="589" /> at this present moment any more than I am prepared to discuss any possible changes in our policy with regard to urban housing.  I think the occasion is not suitable for it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill is introduced for the purpose of making one important change in the Tariff Commission Act, and also for the purpose of carrying into effect a certain transitional arrangement.  The important change which it is proposed to make is to give power to the Executive Council to refer to the Tariff Commission the question of tariffs in certain matters where no application has been made by a representative body or association.  The main object for which this change is proposed is to enable consideration to be given to certain proposals for agricultural tariffs.  There is a number of proposed agricultural tariffs about which there has been a good deal of agitation and in regard to which it would be almost impossible to get a representative group, to put forward an application and to sustain it before the Tariff Commission.  The Executive Council desire that in the case of these particular proposals there should be the public examination that it is possible to have before the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>So far as industrial tariffs are concerned, the new section will give power to the Executive Council to have proposals for industrial tariffs examined before the Tariff Commission without any application being made by a representative group of manufacturers.  It is intended to use that power, if at all, very sparingly.  It will scarcely be used in regard to any industry at present in existence in the country.  The Executive Council feel that an examination not made at the instance of interested parties can hardly be as satisfactory as examinations like those which have already been conducted by the Tariff Commission.  They feel that unless there are people there in the business and interested to put the evidence on one side at least and to make a case it will be very difficult to have an examination conducted on as thorough and practical lines as it ought to be. Therefore, it is proposed to use this power only in cases where some examination seems to be necessary, where there is either a general demand for it, or where there is some prima facie case for examination and where it cannot otherwise be heard.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is the intention of the Minister for Agriculture to move the Executive Council immediately to put a certain number of questions in regard to agricultural tariffs before the Tariff Commission. The other matter which this Bill intends to carry out is to enable the individuals who were former members of the Tariff Commission and who heard evidence in regard to applications, but who have not yet made their reports, to make reports and to have these reports regarded as reports of the Tariff Commission.</P>

      <P>Although this Bill proposes to improve the original Tariff Commission Act of 1926, in a manner which we have frequently suggested, it does not, in any way, modify our opposition to the principle of the original Act.  We believe that the establishment of the Tariff Commission, and the Government's attitude towards it, have resulted in a definite delegation of the fiscal powers of the Government to the Tariff Commission.  That was in consequence of the fact that the Commission, although not required by the Act to make formal recommendations either for or against applications submitted <Col N="593" /> to it, have in fact, always done so, and have drafted their reports for the purpose of making a case in support of their recommendation and not for the purpose for which they were established, that is, the provision of all essential and relevant information concerning the application to members of the Government, and through them, to members of the Dáil.  The Government have always acted upon the reports of the Tariff Commission apparently without question or consideration. So complete has been the abandonment of the Government's fiscal powers to the Tariff Commission that on occasions on which the Tariff Commission recommended against applications these recommendations were not considered by the Dáil at all unless some private Deputy moved a motion in the same relation.</P>
      <P>No machinery exists under the Act, and it is not proposed to insert any machinery by this Bill, to ensure that applications submitted to the Tariff Commission, but not recommended upon favourably by them, will come before the Dáil, which is, or, at any rate, should be, the legislative assembly for the people of the TwentySix Counties.  The establishment of this Commission in accordance with the Act of 1926, and the subordination of the Government's judgment in tariff matters to the judgment of the Commission has meant a definite loss of that freedom of action in fiscal matters without which the Government cannot possibly deal effectively with the situation existing in this country. The Government, only last week, discovered, in the case of the dairying industry, that the circumstances of an industry frequently require that immediate action should be taken if a prima facie case for the imposition of a tariff exists, subject to whatever alteration or modification may be considered desirable after some detailed and subsequent examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in such cases, however, we think that a more detailed examination can best be performed by committees, composed of persons possessing special knowledge of the industry concerned, and meeting for the purpose of submitting reports on that industry, and on that industry alone. <Col N="594" /> Some permanent body to consider applications for the reduction or alteration of tariffs and to watch the effect of tariffs should exist, but should not be exalted to the position occupied by the present Tariff Commission, in which it, and it only, can decide whether or not a tariff should be imposed. Of course, despite the fact that this Commission has been established with those powers, the deciding factor influencing it in all its decisions has been the policy of the Government. The personnel of the Commission included persons who had on various occasions in the past definitely committed themselves to the advocacy of doctrinaire free trade views, and in this respect the new Commission will be no improvement on the old.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to discuss persons who are not here to speak for themselves, but we are entitled to criticise the Government for having placed in the important office of members of the Tariff Commission persons who have signed reports definitely advocating that the policy of free trade is the best policy for the people of this country to adopt.  It is unreasonable to expect that these people are going suddenly to forget the views which they have been advocating and to adopt a judicial frame of mind when applications come before them.  I think we may take it that members of the new Commission, like those of the old, will be prejudiced against tariffs and will not be in favour of their application, as reports of the old Commission have clearly indicated.  The Tariff Commission method has been designed by the Government to ensure the maximum delay in making a decision on all applications.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to give many instances in order to prove the truth of that contention.  On 4th June last, for example, the Minister for Finance told us that the reports upon the applications under consideration by the Tariff Commission in relation to wrapping-paper and to coach bodies were almost ready and that he was expecting them within a very short period from the date on which he spoke, namely, 4th June.  One of these reports was published last week and the other has not yet been published. <Col N="595" /> On the same occasion the Minister for Finance referred to the Grain Inquiry which was conducted by members of the Tariff Commission, and he said that the drafting of the report was reaching a very advanced stage and that the report was likely to be in his hands at an early date.  He spoke later, and indicated that the Tariff Commission would be able to present the report of the Grain Inquiry within six weeks.  The report has not been submitted yet, although six months have passed since then.</P>
    <P>I submit that the failure of the Tariff Commission to fulfil an undertaking, which it apparently had given to the Minister when he spoke in that manner in the Dáil, was not due to the fact that the members of that Commission were not whole-time officers, but rather to the fact that the Government indicated to the Commission that they did not want the report until the Dáil reassembled in November.</P>
    <P>Now to deal with the provisions of the Bill.  It provides, as the Minister indicated, for one alteration of considerable moment in the existing Act, and also for the continuance of the existing Commission while the applications now before it are being completed. The section which provides that the Executive Council may submit a question to the Commission, irrespective of whether an application for a tariff had been received from any group of manufacturers, is undoubtedly a substantial improvement on the existing Act.  It is an improvement which we have urged here on many occasions during the last three years, and there was no one so eloquent in denouncing the proposal as the Minister for Finance.  I would like him to tell us why he has suddenly changed his mind in regard to the desirability of this provision.</P>
    <P>Only as late as July 29th last he condemned it as unnecessary, and said that in the Tariff Commission Act the Government deliberately took up the point of view that they would not impose a tariff unless the people who were either carrying on the industry, or who satisfied the Commission that they could and would carry it on, made an application. <Col N="596" /> On another occasion&mdash;the occasion of the debate on the Estimate this year&mdash;he said that they would not put on a tariff in the hope that somebody would take it up, or that something might happen, or unless they had a definite application from persons engaged in the industry concerned.  If Deputies take the trouble to go back to the debates they will find that when the matter was before the Dáil the same proposal was made by members on this side, but was rejected with scorn by the Minister for Finance. Whatever has happened within the last six months, the Minister for Finance has made a complete right-about-turn, and now asks the Dáil to embody in an Act a suggestion to which he would not listen in the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Government have realised that they are out of step with the rest of the country in the matter of protection, and are trying to give people the belief that they are prepared to move faster in this matter than in the past.  That, however, is only pretence.  If they were anxious to move faster, it is not a Bill to amend the Tariff Commission that would be before us, but a Bill to abolish it.  The Tariff Commission system, no matter how you try to improve it or patch it up, makes for delay, and the appointment of a Tariff Commission, which includes members who are hostile to the idea of affording protection to Irish industry, makes for something more than delay; it makes for futility.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was just as strongly opposed to the idea of a whole-time Tariff Commission as he was to the idea of having questions referred to it by the Executive Council. Just as frequently as the other matter was raised here so also the matter of having the Tariff Commission a whole-time body was repeatedly brought forward by Deputies on these benches, and on every occasion the Minister for Finance said that the appointment of a whole-time Tariff Commission would be of no benefit whatever. It was not merely that he did not think that a whole-time Tariff Commission would not have enough work to do, but he urged that the actual operation of the machinery required that a certain interval should <Col N="597" /> elapse between the stages of hearing applications and that no matter how many applications were pending there would he periods when the members of the Commission would have no duty to perform.</P>
    <P>On June 4th, which is not a very long time ago, he said: &ldquo;I think there are not going to be many more applications, at least not so many as would occupy even one Commission working full time.&rdquo;  Since June 4th some of the existing applications have been dealt with and, as far as I know, no further applications of major importance have been made.  Why, therefore, has the Government decided upon the change of policy if it is not intended merely to hoodwink the people into believing that they have changed their attitude also?  If the appointment of a whole-time Tariff Commission is going to put some Irish industrialists out of pain more quickly, then it may be an advantage because, as Deputies are aware, there are owners of industrial concerns in this country who are keeping them running at a loss in the hope that at some time in the future their applications for tariffs will be favourably considered and that they will be able to put their concerns upon a paying basis.  Most of those industrialists who have run their concerns in that way have found that they were doomed to disappointment&mdash;the persons connected with the flour-milling industry, the persons connected with the paper-making industry, and, we fear, the persons connected with the coach-building industry.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government on the question of whole-time protection for Irish industries and of establishing proper machinery to enable that protection to be considered has been most unsatisfactory.  I do not know if that is because they are opposed to tariffs on principle or whether it is merely a reflection of the mentality often shown by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here, who believes that no Irish factory, no matter how long it has been established, or how well it is doing, can be efficiently managed, using the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; to denote the way factories are managed in England. We hope that as a result of the <Col N="598" /> passage of this Act some of the applications that have been pending as long as from 1927 and 1928 will be reported on, shall we say, before 1933.  There is not much prospect of it if the new Commission is going to continue in the same manner as the old, visiting concerns in England, discussing the question of affording protection for Irish industries with the English competitors of these industries and delaying until all the trivial points in relation to the applications have been cleared up to their satisfaction.  In respect of almost all the applications which came before the Tariff Commission there was a clear case for protection, but the Tariff Commission did not think it desirable to take the unprecedented step which they took last week and recommend to the Government that a tariff should be imposed pending consideration of the application by the Commission.</P>
    <P>There was no case for the imposition of a duty on butter, other than a political case, in the manner in which it was imposed which did not exist also for the imposition of a duty upon imported coachwork.  Deputies are aware that when the application of the coach-builders for a tariff was made in 1926 the development of road transport was only beginning.  There were very few buses then in the country, but everybody knew that there was going to be a very rapid development of bus traffic in these days and that the competing companies would be rushing in buses as quickly as possible.  The Government were asked to bring it to the notice of the Tariff Commission and to impose a temporary prohibition on the importation of buses while the Tariff Commission was considering the application, but they would not consider that request.  The country is now flooded with buses.  Some of the factories which were then working are now closed down, the skilled workers have gone to England or emigrated to some other country, and the efficiency of the industry is very much impaired while the report has not yet been submitted.</P>
    <P>If the appointment of a whole-time Tariff Commission and the giving of this power to the Executive Council are going to result merely in the submission of a larger number of reports <Col N="599" /> of the type we got last week, in relation to the butter industry, or some time ago in relation to the flour industry, then it would be better to have the Bill rejected.  The publication of such reports does not provide the members of the Dáil with the information which they should have and does not solve the difficulties of Irish industries but merely helps to provide ammunition for those who, in the interest of the British importers, are anxious to ensure that free trade will be the accepted policy of the majority in this Dáil.  Having advocated the amendment of the Tariff Commission Act in the past, in the way in which the Minister proposes to amend it now, presumably we will have to support this Bill, but we do so with no enthusiasm whatever because we do not feel that it will make the slightest difference whether the Bill is passed or not so long as the policy of the Executive Council remains as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this measure we have to consider whether or not the machinery of the Tariff Commission is necessary before tariffs are imposed.  I think that anyone, with the experience of the last six years of tariffs, even in the limited fashion in which they have been imposed, that would hold that a prior examination and a very detailed examination is not necessary, would be very foolish indeed.  I believe that such examination is necessary, very necessary because there are many implications and reactions which should be taken into account in the case of a tariff that to the ordinary Deputy here would not be apparent, and would not, perhaps, come to his mind at all when he proposed to introduce a tariff.  I do not believe, as I have said before, in indiscriminate tariffs.  I do not believe in the rushing of tariffs.  I think it is likely that such a policy would do a permanent injury to the establishment and the maintenance of industries in this country.  I do not believe in putting on a tariff for every little industry which is struggling here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible there may be industries here that are not quite suitable, and that are not worth maintaining <Col N="600" /> in the country.  I do not think the tariff, or any other method, should be used to keep them alive if they are not a benefit to the country as a whole. We should not have the idea that because some little industry established here is an Irish industry that therefore at all costs it must be maintained.  I do not think that is a wise policy to have in mind.  Before we take steps to encourage, support and maintain industry in the country we must be satisfied that it is of national benefit.  So far as this Bill is concerned, as I mentioned here last Wednesday week, I think the Government are now attempting to do, even in a halting way, what the Labour Party suggested should be done when the original Bill was introduced in 1926.  They are going as far as we suggested at the time they should go.  Although power is to be given in this Bill to the Executive Council to recommend, or put before the Tariff Commission, certain cases in regard to which no application for a tariff has been made by any group of individuals, the Government are still confining the duties of the Tariff Commission entirely to the imposition of a customs duty.  The Tariff Commission has no right, and no powers are being given to it, to examine whether any other form of help would be useful to an industry.  It is all a question of a tariff or no tariff.  There may be circumstances in certain industries where assistance could be given to them in the form of bounties, subsidies or reorganisation of one kind or another. While that assistance can be given by the mere imposition of a customs tariff, the Tariff Commission has no right or authority to enquire into that aspect of the case, and I think that is a distinct flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It was stated here in 1926 that the powers given to the Tariff Commission were largely founded on the scheme then in operation in South Africa. There was a very significant power given in the South African Bill, and although it was pressed at the time that something similar should be put into our Bill, nothing was done.  I will read the paragraph dealing with what I am referring to.  It will be found in Vol. 16 of the Official Debates, column 1850:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The Board established shall, in addition to performing the duties first imposed, inquire into and report to the Minister upon the nature, extent and effect of agreements, arrangements, combinations, associations and trusts connected with or affecting commerce, finance, manufacture, mining, trade or transport in so far as they tend to the creation of monopolies or to the restraint of trade, and submit to the Minister recommendations as to any action necessary or advisable for preventing such creation of monopolies or restraint of trade.</P>
    <P>In other words, the powers given to the Tariff Commission were not merely to say whether or not a particular tariff should be imposed and then forget all about it, but they were given powers to inquire into the effect of tariffs and their reactions on the industrial and economic life of the country.  I should like to see much wider powers given to the Tariff Commission than it is proposed to give in this Bill, a Bill which extends the powers given to them originally.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that the power which has been taken in the second section of the Bill would be used very sparingly: that so far as industrial tariffs were concerned it would hardly be used at all.  That is what I gathered from the Minister's statement, that this power was taken largely in order to get inquiries made into certain aspects of the agricultural industry rather than in connection with the industrial sections. While I think that is an unwise policy on the part of the Executive Council, I believe it will be found that there are industries here which are capable of very great expansion, but the people engaged in them are not anxious, from their own personal point of view, for any such extension.  They are making a nice thing out of them as it is, and are quite satisfied to let things go along as they are, while the interests of the community and of the country as a whole are not taken into account. If and when such an industry can be found&mdash;it is open, I know, to do it under the Bill&mdash;it ought to be the policy of the Executive Council to have <Col N="602" /> such a case as that referred to the Tariff Commission for examination and report, with a view to finding out whether, in the interests of the country rather than in the interests of the industrialists themselves, such an industry could be extended and improved. I do not know whether the Minister explained the reason for the change as regards Section 3 of the Bill.  Hitherto the Commission reported to the Minister for Finance.  In future they will report to the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I am glad that it is proposed to make the Commission permanent. I hope the necessity will be seen for giving the Commission plenty of work to do.  As far as I can see they will not have a very great deal of work to do unless the Ministry gives them more powers than are proposed under this Bill.  If they are merely to inquire as to whether or not a customs duty is to be imposed, without giving any consideration at all as to the position of industries, then I think their time will not be fully occupied.  At least I can see that a time will soon arrive when they will have very little to do if they are to be confined entirely to the question of whether or not a tariff should be imposed.  The limitation in the Bill with regard to this question of a customs duty is one that, I believe, will be detrimental to the whole question of industrial reorganisation and revival.</P>

      <P>I very seldom find myself in agreement with the Leader of the Labour Party, but in the speech that he has just made I find myself in agreement with every word that he has <Col N="603" /> uttered.  In considering the Bill, Deputy O'Connell said you had to have regard to the question whether or not the machinery at the disposal of the Tariff Commission was necessary. All of us, I think, with the exception perhaps of the Opposition, have come round to the point of view now that such consideration is necessary.  Deputy O'Connell asked if sufficient powers were given to the Tariff Commission.  Is there anything necessary for the development of Irish industry outside the mere imposition of a tariff?  The Deputy referred to the powers given to the South African Board.  Deputies who have studied the question of trade in countries outside our own will realise that in the particular case to which Deputy O'Connell referred far-reaching results have been achieved.  Whether these results have been due to the operations of that particular Board or not, I do not intend to take upon myself to say, but I would draw the attention of the House to one important fact, and that is the wonderful development that has taken place in the trade of South Africa.  In 1911 it was £17,000,000 and in 1929 £100,000,000. Such a development must have been due to the operation of some cause or causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular way in which Deputy O'Connell criticised the Bill and offered his opinion that the powers of the Tariff Commission were too restricted will, in my opinion, be found difficult to refute in this House.  Speaking from this side of the House, I would like to point out that all parties in this House are definitely committed to a protectionist policy, with perhaps the exception of one single Deputy&mdash;I do not know whether I can call him a Party or not.  I would suggest, in concurrence with the views expressed by Deputy O'Connell, that in view of the backward condition of Irish industry to-day, and in view of the chaotic condition which the discussion of the past few days has revealed in Irish industry, other and more heroic steps are necessary than the powers given to the Tariff Commission under this Bill.  The main object of the Bill is the development of Irish <Col N="604" /> industry.  Does any man in this House think that the imposition of tariffs is the only factor in industrial development? Does any man listening to me believe that if we had carried the resolution proposed by the Opposition the other day for the imposition of a tariff on bacon we could ever hope to raise the Irish bacon trade, by merely imposing a tariff, to the same position that the Danish bacon trade occupies to-day?  Anybody who considers the industrial question in this country must come to only one conclusion, and that is, that if industrial development is to progress at a proper rate of speed we must take other steps than the mere imposition of tariffs.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister for Finance when he referred to that particular section of the Bill giving the Executive certain powers to bring certain cases before the Tariff Commission. I regret that in his statement he informed the House that the Executive mainly intended such tariffs to be applied to the agricultural industry.  I was hoping that the powers which the Executive enjoy under this Bill would have been applied not to the agricultural, but to the industrial side of the question.  Any man who knows anything about Irish industries and their decline knows that when we had industries in this country very different steps were taken by the Irish Parliament that then functioned from the steps we are taking in this Parliament to-day.</P>
    <P>Are we never to consider in this House the resurrection of the industries which are defunct?  Are we never to consider the setting up of the cotton trade in this country?  I remember Deputy Anthony saying, when he was speaking on the question of the woollen tariff in this House, that there was a huge demand for the lower or shoddy grade articles in this country, and which the woollen manufacturers were not prepared to produce.  Are we never to make an attempt to meet that demand? Are we never going to resurrect our defunct industries?  Are these industries to be dead for ever?  Any man who knows anything about the history of industry in this country knows not only the steps that were <Col N="605" /> taken in this House but the steps that were taken by the old Irish Parliament to maintain industry and keep it on its feet.  I heard a Deputy say in this House that the State never had an industrial arm and never had an industrial tradition.  Was there ever a grosser slander on Irish industrialists than the statement made by that Deputy?  Does he not know that before the abolition of the Customs Act that operated between England and Ireland the export trade of this country was on a par with the export trade of England? Yet we are told we have no industrial tradition and no industrial arm.  Was there ever a more unjustified statement than that?  The cotton industry was set up here through the operation of the old Irish Parliament, which voted a subsidy of £50,000 for the purpose, and brought over operatives from Lancashire and installed machinery.  Similar steps will have to be taken by this House if results are to be achieved.  I welcome the Bill, and especially that section which gives certain powers to the Executive.  It marks, at any rate, the end of laissez faire in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>There was an idea prevalent in this House that private enterprise must accomplish everything as far as the rehabilitation of Irish industry is concerned. This Bill shows a turning away from that point of view and that the policy of laissez faire which exists in no other country in Europe but in the Free State is receiving its quietus. The doctrine of non-interference in industry by any Government, that has been held so resolutely in this country for a number of years, has gone by the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked were there any other steps the Tariff Commission could take for the rehabilitation of Irish industry.  I wonder with Deputy O'Connell whether this is not an opportune time for considering these powers.  Everyone knows that unless positive action is taken by the State for the resurrection of industry after its emergence from the economic oppression and depression which this State has endured these industries cannot be resurrected.  Supposing the Tariff Commission had the power, <Col N="606" /> what is the first step necessary?  There should be some knowledge of industrial matters, and there should be a selection of certain industries by the Commission suitable for operation in this country, that would work on a dividend paying basis, and would prove of economic value to the State. Are these powers conferred in this Bill?  Has the Commission the scope or powers to consider anything outside of what may be brought before them. In my opinion the Commission has no such powers.  If this is to be a really live Bill for the benefit of Irish industry I ask all parties to agree with me that further powers should be given to the Tariff Commission.  What is the second consideration for the rehabilitation of Irish industry in this country?  It is the consideration of our export and our import trade.  Has the Commission power to consider such matters?  If it considers such matters what power has it to effect any recommendations it may make?  That power would be necessary if recommendations were made as regards industrial credits.  Does the House mean if the powers are not in the Bill to give them to the Tariff Commission or to some other body?</P>
    <P>I was heartily glad when we elicited one thing from the Minister for Finance in the course of the debate to-day, and that was, that in future all recommendations from the Tariff Commission will be made to the Executive rather than to the Department of Finance.  I do recognise, and I will pay tribute to the sterling ability of the Minister for Finance, but in my opinion the Department of Finance has hitherto exercised too great a power over the Department of Industry and Commerce upon industrial questions, and I do suggest that the referring of the reports of the Tariff Commission to the Executive is a step in the right direction, and if I might say so the most vital step of all as far as Irish Industry is concerned would be the reorganisation of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Is there anything in this Bill to give the Tariff Commission these powers? Is there any machinery at present to <Col N="607" /> deal with the question of such outstanding importance as the organisation of Irish industry.  These are questions which should be considered in the passage of this Bill.  The first thing anyone dealing with industrial development in this State should consider would be a survey of the whole field of Irish industry.  How can it be developed, how can it be built up, how can fallen industries be put further along the road of industrial progress?  That would be the aim of anyone dealing with industrial development.  For instance, what powers have the Tariff Commission got to deal with the resurrection of such an industry as the cement industry?  I have had from constituents close to my area frequent representations upon the cement trade. They have asked why deposits of cement should be bought by foreign interests and kept idle in this country. These are important questions that should be dealt with, in my opinion, by a body such as the Tariff Commission, or a similar body that would function side by side with it.  Are such powers incorporated in this Bill, or, if they are not incorporated, why are they not incorporated?</P>
    <P>I listened to a speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil a few days ago, and in the course of the speech he said: &ldquo;It is essential to the development of this country that we should have here a knowledge of what other nations are doing, that such knowledge is vital to industrial progress.&rdquo; That is a statement, I feel sure, no Deputy in this House will deny.  Has the Minister examined the economic conditions in other countries? Did he examine the economic systems of other countries before the introduction of this Bill? Has he found anything in the machinery existing in other countries that could be incorporated with advantage for the industrial development of this State?  The very limited powers conferred on the Tariff Commission under this Bill will only leave us just one little whit better than we were. Nobody will deny that the burning question in this country at present is industrial development, and I, for one, say unhesitatingly that any <Col N="608" /> man who trusts to industrial development to the mere imposition of a tariff knows nothing good, bad, or indifferent about the subject.</P>
    <P>If for a moment one might ask in passing through this House what has led to the industrial development of other countries, can anyone tell me in this House who knows anything about industrial matters that there is a single country in the world whose industrial development depended on a Bill such as we are asked to pass through this House?  Have they done it in America, Germany, Belgium or Denmark?  Have they trusted to a Bill of this kind to rehabilitate their industries and set them on their feet? We have various methods and tariff commissioners in various countries, but in all countries we have additional machinery to the mere imposition of a tariff where industrial success has been achieved.  We have in America standardisation and organisation of works, tariffs, mass production, co-ordination of departments with a central departmental authority.  Is there anything in this Bill to enable the Tariff Commissioners to put Irish industry upon the same level or to use the same steps that have built up the great industries in America?  Is there anything in that Bill to follow the example laid down for us in Germany?  Is there anything in the State to function on the same lines as the economic bodies that are functioning in Germany?</P>
    <P>I would like to inform this House that, when I see arguments put forward for the non-interference of the State in industrial matters, I cannot help thinking that in a country like Germany, from the very inception of industry, the State has taken every possible step to develop and aid it, but in this country what steps will be taken by the passage of this Bill? Scientific tariffs, I grant you, will be imposed.  Will there be anything else? Will there be anything there to deal with the reorganisation of industry? If one considers for a moment the iron trade of Belgium, with its vast financial resources behind it, its huge sales organisation at home and abroad, how can our unfortunate manufacturers hope to stand here, as they are now, individually against worldwide <Col N="609" /> competition of that kind?  When we are passing a Bill like the Tariff Commission Bill through this House, it is the opportune time to consider questions of such magnitude.</P>
    <P>We listened to a statement the other day made by the Minister for Agriculture in this House.  He said, with regard to our exports in the bacon trade to the English market, that from the information in his possession he was of opinion that if we could increase that trade by either doubling or trebling the quantity of our bacon exports to the London market we would succeed not in reducing the prices, but in actually obtaining a larger figure for it.  There is no organisation existing in the bacon trade, good, bad, or indifferent, to deal with questions of this kind.  Do you find any other country in the world with a trade of such magnitude and importance as the Irish bacon trade that can be raised to such an economic position?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether that speech is socialistic or not, it is a speech which should be made in this House.  Do you find France in that position?  Do you find an industry such as Deputy Davin is interested in, the motor and transport industry; do you find the agricultural group, the sugar-growing group, without any organisation whatever in this country?&mdash;and then we are talking about industrial development. I wonder what led Germany to take the steps in industrial development she has taken?  It was an absolute disgust for politicians.  It was the finding out of one vital thing which anyone who knows anything about industry has found out in this House, the absolute ignorance on industrial questions that exists in the bulk of the members of this assembly.  I am not making that statement in a belittling way; that has been discovered in every assembly in the world, and has led Germany to take the steps which have put her at the economic centre of the whole world.  In this country it appears to be a kind of fetish that industrialists and those connected with industry shall have as little to do with the framing of legislation as possible. <Col N="610" /> In Germany, for instance, the legislation framed and passed through the Reichstag is framed by the economic council before it ever reaches the House.  Here industrialists come in by back-door means and they make representations which may or may not be paid attention to.  What I do say is this, that it is a great pity, when industrial questions come up in this House, that they should be merely questions of party politics for one side or the other.  That was another reason why Germany removed from the Reichstag the framing of industrial legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House any longer.  I hope I have explained some of the machinery that other countries have adopted for industrial development. But when I hear a man in this assembly telling me that this country has no industrial tradition I realise it is a pure waste of time.  I cannot help raising my voice in protest against such a statement against industrialists in this country.  I believe that in 20 years if the proper machinery is set going in this State, we will be on the same level in industry as Denmark is to-day, and that our exports will be just as large as the exports of Denmark.  But if we keep on in the old Paddy-go-easy way or what is everybody's business is nobody's business, as we are now doing, I see no hope whatever for the industrial development of this nation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne has complained of the abysmal ignorance of this House on economic matters. There is some degree of truth in that, but Deputy Byrne should not have set himself up as the awful example. Really I was surprised to find such ignorance on economic matters as Deputy Byrne himself showed before the House.  What I think is wrong with the last speaker is that this Bill is altogether too short.  He has gone over the whole gamut to find out the things that were not in it.  I think there is hardly one matter on industrial or economic subjects that Deputy Byrne has not spoken about except what is exactly in this Bill. To some extent, he was optimistic.  He <Col N="611" /> said the Bill was giving greater powers to the Tariff Commission than it hitherto had.  Deputy O'Connell complained that the Tariff Commission were not likely to have very much to do, that the Executive Council are not keeping them fed with work.  I can see in Section 4 of this Bill opportunities for the Tariff Commission to work for the next couple of years very strenuously on a whole-time job.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the new Commission.  The new Commission will have powers to modify and abolish tariffs.  I think the first duty of the new Commission should be to examine the tariffs that have already been imposed to see the economic effects of those tariffs, to see the reactions in places where they were first imposed which nobody dreamt of, and when they have dealt with that question I would then say it would be quite time, when we get the report of the effect of the existing tariffs, to give them some new material to work upon.  Deputy Byrne, like all true economists and gentlemen who are bursting to do something for industry in this country, suggested as one of the greatest examples of what may be done by the Tariff Commission that they should inquire into the possibilities of the cotton industry in Ireland.  I think if a man were to search the world for a particular article that does not suit this country to manufacture it would be cotton. Look at Manchester.  The condition of the cotton trade there at the present time does not give much hope of entering into that trade here.</P>

      <P>The Deputy very cleverly referred to South Africa and he used one very non-committal sentence. He said the trade of South Africa had increased by millions and that the increase was due to some cause or causes.  That was a very safe statement to make.  Why he used it to illustrate his argument in favour of tariffs I do not know.  The mentality at the back of tariffs, in my opinion, is summed up in Deputy Byrne's speech. He represents the whole-hog tariff reformer, while I maintain that there is nothing for this country but free trade. I welcome the Bill for the very reason that there are powers left to the new Commission to modify and abolish tariffs.  I do hope that when they get down to work their first efforts will be to examine tariffs that have already been imposed and see how soon they may be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has it occurred to Deputy Byrne that the main fault of the present situation in regard to industrial development is due to the fact that the Government are not of one mind on the subject of protective measures.  It is because of that obvious fact that I am intervening to ask a few questions.  I would like to know what is to be the starting point of the Tariff Commission under this new Bill.  Presumably they are expected to be acquainted with Government policy. Are they then to attach more importance to the pronouncements on tariffs of the Minister for Agriculture, who says that tariffs always raise prices, than to the pronouncements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who says that only some of the tariffs imposed have raised prices, or again are they to take cognisance of the statement by the Minister for Agriculture in 1925 that not only can tariffs cause <Col N="613" /> no increase in price, but that ultimately goods may decrease in price with tariffs.</P>
      <P>Again, how is the Tariff Commission to ascertain whether they should be guided by the desire to make this country a country of general industry or a country where we would be largely specialists?  How can they ascertain that, I wonder, from the statements of the different Ministers at the present time?  An even more important question that I want to ask is: Whether the promises made by the League of Nations in 1927 are going to be adhered to by the Tariff Commission, whether the Tariff Commission have got to bear in mind the Report of the World Economic Conference which was held in May, 1927, and which was attended by delegates from the Free State?  The other day I referred to that matter in connection with the President's statement.  I called attention to these remarks of the President.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A series of International Conferences has been held in Geneva, in which the ruling purpose has been the removal or reduction of obstacles to the interchange of commodities within European States.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on, he said: &ldquo;Economic forces are deploying on the International field which, if their bearing on our interests were not constantly and carefully studied, might go far to stereo-type these activities by which we live. They might nullify the best meant efforts to widen the scope of these activities, and broaden the basis for the exercise of our industrial and commercial abilities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ventured to remark in connection with that statement that if the movement referred to were in any way sinister for this country that the Saorstát was not altogether without responsibility for it.  I referred to this report that I have just now mentioned, and described it as, in spirit at least, a free trade document.  The Minister for External Affairs intervened and said: &ldquo;No, no, it could not be described as a free trade document.&rdquo; Continuing, I said that it had been signed by the representatives of the Saorstát, and the same Minister again intervened with a very satirical remark. Well, I have the report here <Col N="614" /> now, and I find that the delegation from the Free State consisted of Messrs.  Michael MacWhite, Wm. Dinan, James J. McElligott, Robert C. Ferguson, Thomas Barrington, and an expert, Mr. James M. Adams.  I find that when I described Mr. McElligott as the &ldquo;present&rdquo; Chairman of the Tariff Commission I was wrong by four days.  But I had no means of knowing then that he had already resigned from the Tariff Commission.  It is important, however, to know that he was Chairman of the Tariff Commission at the time that he was reported as having attended that Conference.</P>

The important thing for us is that there is a document emanating from the League of Nations, and adopted unanimously with the two exceptions I have mentioned.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Moore that the policy which the Government <Col N="618" /> representatives have been preaching in foreign countries in regard to tariffs must have some influence on the tariff policy at home here. You, sir, said that Deputy Moore's line of argument was out of order. The title of this Bill is an Act to amend the Tariff Commission Act by conferring on the Executive Council power to refer to the Tariff Commission matters and questions relating to customs and so on.  Now, we want to know exactly what matters the Government are going to refer to the Tariff Commission. Now is the time for them to state their policy.  Are they going, as Deputy Moore has asked, to be bound by certain delegations or agreements or conventions entered into at the League of Nations or elsewhere, or are they going to have a rigid examination of all Irish industries of any importance to see how far these industries can be fostered?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, after his long holiday in London, has come home to tell us he has made several important inquiries in the matter of economic research.  He has seriously taken up the question of providing unemployment figures so that after seven or eight years of his administration the country may be in a position to know what exactly is the extent of unemployment.  Another matter that the Minister is taking up is the question of prices.  He told us, having returned from London, that he felt the whole question of tariffs would have to be examined in view of the fact that there was a general fall in prices. It seems rather late in the day for the Minister to wake up to that fact.  The fall in prices has been going on steadily since 1922.  During the past five or six years it has meant an enormous difference in the income of the agriculturist, with a corresponding advantage to the person who is in receipt of a fixed salary or income.  The Minister has a bureau of statistics, and I think it is nearly time, after so many years, and when so much money and labour have been devoted to that work, that more attention should be given to this matter and it should be brought into conformity with the Government's tariff policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> When we came into this House we said that there should be an Economic Commission, or a Tariff Commission if you like, which would go into the whole question of Irish industry.  The Minister scoffed at that, but now he is prepared to accept by instalments the suggestions made from this side of the House.  The first suggestion made was that this should be a whole-time Commission. A further suggestion was made from these benches to the effect that the Tariff Commission should go into the whole question of costings and, if necessary, fix safeguards for the protection of the consumer.  The first Tariff Commission was moving so slowly that it was not giving satisfaction to anybody.  Now we are in danger of having a Tariff Commission which will overnight carry into effect whatever may suit the existing political situation.</P>
    <P>We want to see this whole question gone into.  We are not concerned with the League of Nations, with international blocs or with the repercussions of economic groups.  Whether these economic groups or international blocs go ahead or not, we have a policy which we should all combine to carry into effect, and that policy is to increase production in agriculture and in our manufactures by every means in our power.  This Tariff Commission will be confined absolutely to one particular thing, and that is the fostering of industries by means of customs duties.  Last Friday the Ministry admitted here that in that regard the Tariff Commission is incomplete. It has only one weapon for dealing with industrial advance.  We have the position that the Government themselves rushed the proposal for a total prohibition in the case of an important item affecting the breakfast table of every member of the community.  That was done because the Tariff Commission as constituted had no power to deal with bounties, subsidies or the Merchandise Marks Act.</P>
    <P>I will take a case that may be somewhat removed from the immediate question of tariffs, but in my opinion it has an important bearing on the home industry.  I refer to the question <Col N="620" /> of hire-purchase agreements. There is no use in attempting to develop industries here against foreign competition.  Not alone are the foreign combines so strong that they can afford for a considerable time to dump goods here at a price that the Irish manufacturer could not possibly equal in the way of production&mdash;and that would be a terrible thing for the native manufacturer to compete against&mdash;but the local manufacturer has to compete also against the credit system and that absolutely takes away all possibility of the advancement of a manufacturer with £10,000, £50,000, or even £100,000 behind him.  You have combines coming from across the water setting up shops and giving special terms.  They do not even ask for cash down or a deposit for large quantities of imported articles.  Some effort ought to be made to deal with that.</P>
    <P>There is also a question which I think Deputies, whether or not they agree with the tariff policy, must receive with a certain amount of approbation. I refer to the marking of foreign foodstuffs with the name of the country of origin.  That is a proposal which has been recommended several times by different associations in the country, but nothing has been done. We have a very large import of manufactured articles.  We are told that this country will have to face the storm of economic depression that is blowing over the whole world.  If that is so, the sooner we get down to this business and the more effective means we adopt to meet the situation the better for us all.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has called attention to the reason why he refuses to institute any safeguard for the consumer.  He has on a number of occasions, when it suited him, attacked the tariff policy by quoting certain examples of where the tariffed article has increased in price.  He has said in certain cases, such as boots and shoes, that the consumer is, in fact, paying an increased price of 7 per cent. If that 7 per cent. is unjustifiable, and if the Minister believes it has no raison d'être, why does he not take steps to have the whole question of the costings in that industry gone into? Why does he not take steps to have <Col N="621" /> the price fixed for the consumer?  Why does he not tell the House the exact position in this industry, or say how long will the country have to support it?  The taxpayer is paying £950,000 in respect of duties on boots, shoes and clothing.  When we have Ministers telling us that tariffs are going to increase the cost of living, the man in the street naturally asks whether the Ministers are sincere when they have taken no steps to investigate the situation in respect of industries which are producing the articles for which the consumer is contributing nearly £1,000,000.  We have a long list of manufactured articles coming across the water, and I would like to know whether the Tariff Commission is going to be asked by the Government to go into the whole question of these imports so as to find out whether it is economical to start industries by which we could replace these imported articles with home products, and whether to do so would be a good thing for the nation.  They could further examine what steps ought to be taken to develop these industries from the technical point of view, and what steps will be necessary to get credit for them or to induce capital to be invested.  All these are matters which, as the Tariff Commission Bill stands at present, will be left outside its purview.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says his Department is going to examine this question.  His Department has not been able to tell us what is the extent of unemployment, and it is not able to tell us how the costings of the tariffed industries stand or what relation they bear to the consumer.  A Department that is not able to do these things is not likely to give any better results in the future in spite of all the money that is spent upon it.  We feel the best thing to do, now that the Tariff Commission is being reconstituted, is to give it carte blanche to go into the whole question of industrial reconstruction and to examine the question from every angle&mdash;from the point of view of technical efficiency and the provision of capital.  If the whole matter were gone into from that point of view we <Col N="622" /> would be much more whole-hearted in supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be concluded that there is any great change of attitude on the part of the Government towards the work of the Tariff Commission.  During the past eighteen months or so it has undoubtedly become apparent that the consideration of applications was proceeding somewhat more slowly than it ought to proceed. In the first period when the Tariff Commission was working it was able to get ahead very satisfactorily from the point of view of speed with the consideration of applications.  As time went on further demands that other work made on members resulted in the Tariff Commission work being slowed up to an appreciable extent.  I do not know whether we would have decided to appoint a whole-time Tariff Commission, even although certain delays took place, if it had not been that we also came to the decision that it was better to clear the air in regard to certain matters relating to agricultural tariffs.  The decision to set up a whole-time Tariff Commission, and the decision to refer certain agricultural proposals to the Tariff Commission were taken together.  As a matter of fact, there have been, in addition to applications partly dealt with by the Tariff Commission, certain new applications that came in in recent months. There were applications in June for increasing the duty on men's and boys' suits and overcoats; and on the 8th of August there was an application for a tariff on linen and cotton tissues; and later in the month there was an application for a tariff on oatmeal. These particular tariffs will be considered by the new Commission along with certain, other applications in regard to which the old Commission had not heard the evidence.  We will, in fact, for a little time have two Tariff Commissions.  We will have the members of the old Commission dealing with applications which were already before them, and the new body dealing with new applications that may come in in the ordinary way, and certain matters that the Government will submit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole-time Commission, in one respect, has a distinct advantage over <Col N="623" /> the part-time Commission&mdash;that is, if there is any matter that has to be dealt with urgently it can, for a month or two, give its whole time to it and get along more rapidly.  But nobody could expect, except in a very exceptional class of cases, that it will be possible for the whole-time Tariff Commission to consider an application and prepare a report within a month or two.  Where the whole business is very simple, and perhaps where one or two matters only were in doubt, then the whole-time Commission could, by concentration, perhaps, produce a very speedy report, but where there is likely to be a very considerable conflict of evidence, as has been the case in respect of certain applications already before the Tariff Commission, the interval that will elapse between the time that the matter is referred to the Commission and the issue of a report must always be considerable.  When the Principal Act was before the Dáil as a Bill I pointed out that, in the case of Tariff Commissions, which were whole-time in other countries, a very ordinary period for consideration of tariffs was eighteen months or two years.  I would hope, as our Tariff Commission is not required to go, and has not in the past gone as deeply into the matter as these Commissions in other countries, such a period as that would not elapse, but I think if anybody expects a report in matters which are of a complicated character within eight months or a year he is bound to be disappointed. For instance, I take it that a matter like an application for a tariff on woollen goods would be bound to occupy a considerable period even if you had a Commission dealing with that alone; and we do not propose to set up a number of Commissions to deal with different applications.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why we are anxious to have certain matters in relation to agriculture considered by the Tariff Commission is that we believe a great deal of misunderstanding is being created by the loose sort of discussion that goes on in regard to these tariffs in public.  There is a general demand, which, of course, has not that <Col N="624" /> amount of support that it would seem to have, but which is made in many places, and by many different organisations, and sometimes by the same organisation, in many different forms, for wholesale tariffs on agricultural products, and as already pointed out in the Dáil, when people talk of the advantages to agriculture of tariffs on agricultural products they quote figures which embrace very often not only a variety of small matters, but such things as bacon, feeding stuffs and wheat.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Our view is that the whole case in regard to agricultural tariffs has really to be fought out on the question of bacon, feeding-stuffs and wheat; that, leaving out the question of butter, which is before the Tariff Commission, the other things are of very little consequence. But, as a matter of fact, we have definite calls for tariffs on these matters of little consequence, and, coupled with them, we have the quotation of figures which embrace matters that are of very great consequence. We feel that the whole situation in regard to agricultural tariffs would be very much clarified if these minor matters are referred to the Tariff Commission, and if they are got out of the way one way or another, because, in our view, whether there is a tariff on oats or not is of no real consequence to the country.  The same thing applies to such a thing as feeding-barley. Our view is, whether there was a recommendation for a tariff or against a tariff, it would not make any substantial difference.</P>

      <P>So far as malting barley is concerned, we are not prepared to refer that to the Tariff Commission. The same would apply to eggs.  There are certain imports of eggs and what is called Canterbury lamb and bacon. Our view is that matters such as these should be definitely examined and definitely disposed of.  So far as other things are concerned, such as bacon or feeding-stuffs or wheat, if anybody likes to come forward and make application to the Tariff Commission, then this <Col N="625" /> application will be considered in the ordinary way.  The same thing applies to the question of malting-barley.  If any representative Body comes forward and applies to the Tariff Commission, the thing will be considered in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>When the small things have been got out of the way, then the field will be clear to discuss the question of agricultural tariffs in a practical and realistic way, and it will be impossible to create that confusion that has been attempted to be created during the last year or two.  In regard to getting the Tariff Commission to go into such questions as the reorganisation of industry, bounties, subsidies, and so on, I think enough work is thrown on any commission, whether whole-time or part-time, when we deal with the question of tariffs. The question of prohibition, of course, can be considered by the Tariff Commission, as it simply means the recommendation of a prohibitive tariff.  A prohibitive tariff is for all practical purposes the same thing as definite hard-and-fast prohibition, but there would be nothing to prevent the Tariff Commission recommending a prohibitive tariff if they regarded such a tariff as necessary.  There may be industries where subsidies would be necessary, as, for instance, in the case of sugar beet. If anything arises where it would appear that a subsidy would be the proper thing, the Government would be prepared to have the question of a subsidy examined by some ad hoc body, as it was examined, though it was an informal body, in regard to the sugar beet industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation of industry is a very big matter, and I do not think that any Government commission <Col N="626" /> would be able to do very much in regard to it.  Reorganisation of industry must be done by those who are controlling the industry.  It is true that it would be possible for the Tariff Commission to indicate in their report what they thought of the organisation of an industry, if it became clear that it was in grave need of reorganisation, and might recommend that no steps in regard to a tariff should be taken until that reorganisation had been carried out.  But, broadly speaking, a body like this can do nothing in regard to the reorganisation of industry, and their reports or the reports of any such commission would be of very small value.  Nobody but those concerned in the industry can really get to the heart of a problem like that, and if an industry has to be reorganised it can only be done when those controlling it are convinced that reorganisation is to their advantage, or is absolutely necessary for their survival.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to cases where the personal interest of manufacturers was against a tariff or an application for an increased tariff. Where that appears to be the case, he suggested that the Government themselves should have the matter of an increased tariff brought before the Tariff Commission.  That seems plausible enough, and one might say that if such appeared to be the case it would be quite justifiable for the Government to bring before the Tariff Commission the question of an increased tariff for such an industry.  But it would be very hard indeed for the Tariff Commission to give any sort of effective consideration to such an application.  If the manufacturers here for any particular reason did not want an increased tariff, then it is extremely difficult to get the evidence that it would be necessary for the Tariff Commission to have in order to make up their mind as to whether that industry required or would benefit from an increased tariff.  They would be driven to relying entirely, so far as expert evidence was concerned, on the evidence of people outside the country, and those, presumably, people who did not intend to start here.  Because at present anybody who intends to set an industry going can come before the <Col N="627" /> Tariff Commission, or anybody who wishes to engage in it or who had shown practical evidence of wishing to engage in some extensive way could actually come here, begin in some small way, and go before the Commission.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty of this whole matter of having things considered by the Tariff Commission without an application from interested parties is the difficulty of getting evidence.  There are cases where it might theoretically be quite desirable for the Government to put a thing before the Tariff Commission but in practice it would be useless for them to do so, because no case could properly be made.  It is all very well for a civil servant to have certain views about what would be possible in industry, but his views are bound to be, at the best, theoretical, and they ought to be supported, if any change is going to be made by a tariff, by people who are able to give practical evidence and who have practical experience of the difficulties of various sorts that surround the carrying on of any industry.  Although generally we hold by that view, we are prepared to consider any case on the merits.  Cases may arise where we would send before the Tariff Commission for consideration a question whether there should be a new tariff or an increased tariff for a certain industry, although those interested in the industry had not applied.  But, broadly speaking, we do not think that is a desirable course. We do not think that is a course that will give satisfactory results, or that the Tariff Commission will be able in such a case to furnish reports with the same probability of having understood the whole case and every factor of importance in it.</P>
    <P>A Deputy spoke about defunct industry. I do not think there is any special sacredness attaching to a defunct industry.  The mere fact that an industry had once been here and is now defunct is no reason for giving any special consideration to it.  It might well he that it became defunct because in the modern world it was entirely unsuited to live here.  It might have become defunct for <Col N="628" /> different reasons.  It might have become defunct for reasons connected with the way the business was carried on by those who chanced to own it, or something of that sort.  But, generally speaking, an application in regard to any industry should be considered simply on the merits and having regard to its future prospects, and not its past history.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore asked as to what would guide the Tariff Commission. The Tariff Commission's duty is to be guided by the facts, to answer the questions that are put to them in the Schedule to the Principal Act in the light of the evidence that comes before them.  So far as the Government are concerned, we only want to have the facts.  If the facts, as they can be brought out in any particular case, justify a tariff, then we are glad to impose a tariff.  If the facts indicate that a tariff would be to the disadvantage of the country, then we are equally glad to refuse a tariff, and the Tariff Commission have no instructions or no directions from the Government as to what they will find.  We simply desire them, as I have said, to examine as carefully as they can the evidence that comes before them, to seek out witnesses who will put the full facts of the case before them, to look at the matter in an impartial and unprejudiced way, and to put us in a position to act in the best interests of the whole community.</P>
    <P>We do not bind ourselves to accept any report of the Tariff Commission in any direction, but we have had confidence that the Tariff Commission was able and impartial and we have been ready so far to accept their view, after their labours in each particular matter, as representing the correct view.  If we doubted it we would not hesitate to examine the matter further or in a different way. As I said, we do not bind ourselves to accept any report of the Tariff Commission.  On the other hand, having carefully selected a Commission of able and independent men of integrity who had carefully gone into a matter we would be extremely slow to reject their view.  We have had sufficient experience of tariffs <Col N="629" />&mdash;some of them put on without any examination&mdash;to know that there are two sides to a case.  In the early days we imposed a tariff in at least one instance where it should never have been imposed and for which there was no justification.  It is in respect of an industry which cannot live. Certainly it was a mistake.  It is an industry which in the early days of Sinn Féin was boosted as one that should be kept going and it was one in which we believed.  When I discovered that that industry was hopeless and that a tariff should not have been put on it I became strongly in favour of having a detailed examination in such cases.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill which, on the face of it, bears the explanation that ordinarily would have to be given in regard to it.  It simply reduces to the rates set out in the First Schedule, the rates now being paid.  It also makes consequential amendments, one of which is in regard to the rate to be paid by the State.  Up to date that has been phrased in a particular way. We take it that it is to be three-sevenths of the aggregate amount of the contribution paid by the insured person or employer or, in the case of an exempted person, three-sevenths of the contribution paid by the employer. It keeps roughly the State payments in the same proportion to the new scale paid by the employer and the person insured.  Section 3 makes a change of a consequential type also, namely, the amount of money that would come in from the contributions to the State is reduced as the amount of the first lot is reduced in Section 2 (2).  The old fraction which used to be allocated by way of administrative expenses would not be sufficient.  The amount is kept roughly at the same figure as before and the fraction, since the sum is small, has to be larger.  We go from one-tenth which was contained in the Principal Act and from one-eighth which was in the Amending Act of 1922 to one-fifth of the entire sum.  In the last sub-section, namely, Section 5 (2) it states that the Act shall come into operation on such a day as shall be fixed for that purpose by an order of the Minister.  The reason for that is that it is a matter of some speculation as to when the Bill can come into force after it has been passed into law, because some time will be required to get the new stamps of the new denominations brought out.  Even though I could try to shorten that period by <Col N="632" /> taking action a little bit ahead, once the Bill has got to a certain stage there will be some time required even after the Bill becomes law.  It will not be possible to fix a date in the Bill unless it is put far back, and consequently I am taking power to fix that date by order.</P>

One would expect that he would have told the Dáil what the cost to the fund would be, and what the other financial consequences would be, both to the employer, to the employee, to the State and to the person in receipt of benefit. Merely to present the Bill to the Dáil with a brief explanation of the significance of certain sections, an explanation which is obvious to anybody who reads the Bill, seems to indicate that he is taking his duties in a very slipshod manner.  The Dáil is entitled to ask and to get from the Minister a much more detailed examination of the financial consequences of the Bill than he thought fit to give.  I do not know if it would be in order to ask him to give it now.</P>

      <P>I want to put the position in this way: the State is entitled to take from the funds an amount equal to an eighth of the revenue for the purpose of meeting administration. The revenue of the fund will be varied in some way by the reduction in contributions, and the Bill proposes to alter one-eighth to one-fifth of the fund.  I think we should be informed by the Minister what the effect of the alteration will be, and how, in the first case, the amount of revenue to the fund will be diminished by the diminution of contributions, and to what extent the amount which the State is entitled to take from the fund for administration purposes will be altered by the alteration in the percentage.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave an incorrect figure.  I think the cost of administration may have been £140,000 as the Minister stated, but the Minister was not entitled to get from the fund £140,000.  The amount which he estimated he would be entitled to receive was £110,000.  There was a deficiency.  The cost of administration exceeded the amount which the Minister was entitled to take from the fund.  Do I understand that he now expects that deficiency to be removed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="634" /> thought fit to give a little more information. The position concerning the Unemployment Insurance Fund, as the Minister explained when we were discussing the President's statement here on Wednesday week, was that funds were coming into it to a greater extent than they were going out of it and that consequently the amount due to the Exchequer in consequence of the borrowings which took place prior to 1926 was being repaid at a rapid rate. While we approve of the decision to slow up the rate of repayment to the Exchequer we think that the Dáil should take very careful note of the consequences of that decision.  A reduction in the rate of repayment to the Exchequer would involve a reduction in the rate of cancellation of the debt incurred by the Exchequer in order to provide funds to meet demand for benefit during the period when extended and uncovenanted benefits were in operation.  In a disguised way that means that relief will be given to industry out of borrowed money, a procedure which is of very doubtful wisdom and very doubtful financial rectitude, but which nevertheless may be justified in the circumstances of the moment.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should have explained the implications of the Bill in relation to the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Exchequer when introducing it, and should have pointed out to the Dáil that in fact this slowing up of the rate of repayment to the Exchequer would mean that money borrowed by the Exchequer for the fund would remain outstanding for a longer period, the effect being that the national debt is being maintained at a level higher than it would otherwise be maintained, to enable the State to give this proposed relief to industry. The Minister, or the President, in his statement announced that the total cost to the fund would be in or about £300,000.  Of that, £64,000 will go towards the reduction of taxation, and £225,000 to the employers and the insured workers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question which the Dáil must ask, and which must be decided, is whether the manner in which it is proposed to use that £300,000 in the Unemployment Insurance Fund, is in fact <Col N="635" /> the most suitable under the circumstances that now exist.  The Government proposes to use the entire amount for the purpose of reducing contributions. The reduction in contributions would undoubtedly be of advantage to the workers and the employers concerned, but in view of the fact that this Bill has been introduced largely for the purpose of dealing with a situation in which exceptional distress is prevalent, we think that the manner of the utilisation of that £300,000 should have been more carefully examined than it appears to have been by the Minister, with a view to seeing whether or not the sum could be put to much more advantageous use and expended in a manner which would give more widespread relief in the quarters where relief is needed now, than the proposals contained in the Bill will do.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to work out what the full financial consequences of the proposal in the Bill will be £225,000 will come back to industry.  Some part of the amount given in relief to employers will come back to the State again in increased income tax.  The State will receive a direct benefit estimated at £64,000 and, in addition, will be relieved, we are now informed, to an amount equal to about £20,000, hitherto paid to defray the cost of administration.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the cost of administration up to the present was about £140,000, of which he got £110,000 from the fund, and that the balance of £30,000, or whatever it was, had to be met by the taxpayer.  Now he anticipates that he will get about £136,000 from the fund. With the cost of administration remaining the same, the taxpayer will have to provide £4,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate we can have all this cleared up on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The principal question that I want to get decided now is, whether or not the relief which has been given should be given in the form of a reduction in contributions. That, I think, is the main question at issue in this Bill.  The consequential effects of it on the Unemployment Insurance Fund, or the taxpayer, can be dealt with separately. If the finances of the unemployment insurance scheme were being recast at all, then in our opinion first consideration should have been given to the advisability of removing certain anomalies in the existing scheme. Reference was made yesterday by the Minister to one of these in reply to a Parliamentary Question.  There is at present a six-day waiting period for a short-time man.  We think it should be reduced to three.  The Minister explained that it was not possible to reduce the waiting period to three days without recasting the finances of the scheme.  The finances of the scheme are being recast, and we think that <Col N="637" /> advantage should have been taken of this opportunity to have a general reduction in the waiting period from six days to three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because a fair amount of hardship is inflicted upon insured workers who become unemployed by the fact that they have to wait six days before they become entitled to benefit. We think that if the Minister himself ever had the experience of being unemployed, or had been in touch with people who have had the experience of being unemployed, he would have known something about that.  It is, in fact, one of the hardships about which insured persons talk most frequently. We would like to see it removed, and we think it is quite possible to remove it.  The extra cost on the fund would be small, and the administrative difficulties nil.  It would only require an amendment to the Act and a slight adjustment of the finances.  Insured workers who became unemployed would then become entitled to draw benefit after the expiration of three days instead of six days as is necessary under the existing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the existing Act there is also a provision which debars workers from the receipt of benefit for, I think, more than six months in any insurance year. It is very difficult to understand why that provision was thought necessary when the unemployment insurance scheme was being devised.  It is probable that when the 1920 Act was being passed through the British Parliament it was intended to deal only with workers temporarily disengaged, due to seasonal changes or a temporary disorganisation of industry, and the possibility of a man being out of employment for a period of six months was considered to be remote.  Now we have got to face the reality that a number of people are out of employment not merely for six months but for years at a time.  This Act was not devised to deal with that class of worker, but there appears to be no reason why such a worker, so long as he is entitled to benefit, should not be allowed to draw it.  It has occurred that workers who, for a long period, have been in insurable employment <Col N="638" /> and become disemployed find themselves debarred from the right of drawing benefit for a period, although they had stamps to their credit which would entitle them to benefit.  When the finances of the scheme are being recast, as they are in this Bill, that anomaly should be removed, and the undoubted hardships which result from the existence of that provision in the original Act abolished.</P>
    <P>The main question, however, is whether the money available in the Unemployment Insurance Fund should be used to reduce contributions or increase benefits.  It can be used in one way or the other.  In the circumstances now existing it would appear that there is a much stronger case for increasing the benefits payable under the Act than for decreasing the contributions payable.  The amount received by unemployed persons is very small in relation to the normal cost of providing the absolute necessities of life for a man and his family, and the number who are entitled to receive that benefit is in any case quite small.  In fact, less than half the persons who are registered as unemployed at the labour exchanges are in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, and a good case could be made for utilising this £300,000 to deal with people in such a position as they are in in preference to giving relief to employers and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It seems in fact an amazing performance that the Government should come in one day to the Dáil and propose the expenditure of £300,000 for the relief of unemployment, while at the same time relief of taxation to the extent of £64,000 is given out of the revenue of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  I thought the Minister in introducing this Bill would have given an outline of the reasons which prompted the Executive Council to decide upon a reduction in contributions rather than an increase or an extension of benefits.  It is quite possible that good reasons for that decision exist but, so far, no one has given us any indication whatever as to their nature.  We are left to conclude that the Government were more concerned to give a demonstration of the prosperity which they <Col N="639" /> allege we enjoy than to provide the actualities of relief for those in distress. Most of the acts which the Government have taken during the past three or four days were prompted by political considerations alone.  I think the introduction of this Bill in this form is also prompted by political considerations alone.  Of course, an attempt has been made to pretend that the Government were concerned only with the necessities of the situation and that they would scorn the suggestion that they are attempting to make political capital out of their administration, but anyone who has listened to the speeches delivered here, and who understood their significance, would know that the stage has been set for an appeal to the people and that these measures are only the first move in the General Election game.</P>
    <P>If the Government were concerned to provide relief for a class of person who is in very urgent need of it to-day, that is the worker who has exhausted his right to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Fund, who is still unemployed, and who has very little hope of employment, or if they were concerned to lessen the hardship inflicted in the course of the administration of the Act, the proposals contained in this Bill would be very different to those that are in it.  They were not so concerned, and they are taking the easy course.  It is very easy to decide to spend £300,000 by a reduction of contributions.  That requires no great thought on the part of the Minister and no great exertion on the part of his Department.  It is the lazy man's method of dealing with a complicated situation and the situation is complicated.  There is probably no more complicated code on the statute book than that relating to the unemployment insurance scheme.  I do not pretend to understand it.  I do not think there is any one in this House who pretends to have mastered that code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not due to laziness, I hope?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I have tried to do it and failed.  It seems to us that in consequence of the complicated nature of the code there <Col N="640" /> are unnecessary hardships inflicted on those concerned, which could be removed when there is available a sum of £300,000 with which to do so.</P>
      <P>I might also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that some time ago we discussed the question of entering into a reciprocal arrangement with England in relation to the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit, which would permit of Irish migratory labourers becoming entitled to unemployment insurance benefit when they are unemployed here.  The Minister explained that it was found impossible heretofore to effect any such arrangement with England and that the cost of providing the benefit out of the Irish Free State fund would be heavy.  I think he mentioned a sum of £50,000. I am speaking from memory.  If that is so, surely there was a case for ear-marking that £50,000 out of this £300,000 for that purpose.  If the Minister was determined to use the rest for the reduction of contributions, then the difference to the individual employer or the individual worker would be slight, if, in fact, there would be any difference at all.  We think that whereas the Dáil cannot fail to pass this Bill, because by rejecting it we would only leave the position the same as heretofore, it should pass it with the determination to endeavour to change its provisions, in so far as the Standing Orders permit us to do so, in a very drastic manner when it comes to the Committee Stage.</P>

I want to state that until Deputy Lemass uttered his last sentence I did not know what his Party was going to do.  As far as this Party are concerned, we are going to vote against it.  I do not agree with what Deputy Lemass stated, that we have to vote for the Bill because if we did not we would make the position worse.  I do not agree with the Deputy because then we will be in this position, that if we do not vote for it, and if the Government is not prepared to introduce another Bill to give effect to what we think should be given effect to, the position will be that in another twelve months, instead of having a deficit of <Col N="641" /> £300,000, there will be a credit balance of about £35,000.  I am sure the Deputy will join with me in hoping that at that time there will be a Government in power that will be inclined to use that surplus for the benefit of the unemployed rather than for employers and those fortunate enough to be employed to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say that if we had not to consider those who are unemployed, if we had not a big unemployment problem to-day, and if the present Government had not very considerably reduced the unemployment benefit that was in operation when they came into office, and when the State was set up, then we would not be against this proposal. I know that we will be told, as I think we have been told already by the President, that this is going to help industry, and that it will help employment. I want to say that I do not believe that this is going to do any such thing.  We were told when the Government decided to alter the rates, or to reduce super-tax on the people who were fortunate enough to be liable for super-tax, that it was to help industry and to create more employment. I wonder would the Minister contend that it had that effect.  The same claim was made when the Government decided to reduce income-tax, that it was to help industry.  Now we have the claim made that this £225,000, together with the sum of £64,000, will go to the relief of the taxpayers, and is going to save industry.  The 3d. per week, which will go to the men who are fortunate enough under the existing conditions in this country to be employed, is not going to make a very great difference to them.  I am satisfied that very little of the saving to the employers will be put back into industry.  The greater part of it, if not all, will go to swell whatever profits they are making at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy likes we will take it that way.  I do not believe that the largest contributors to this Unemployment Insurance Fund, the three biggest industrial concerns in the country, are held up from expanding because of the amount of unemployment insurance they have to pay, and I want to say that I have not heard very much objection either from the employer's side or from the employee's as to the contribution which they have had to pay, but there is certainly a very great objection and a great complaint from the unemployed; but what is the position?</P>
      <P>I want to make this again clear as far as I can make it clear, because even during the last couple of days I have heard the word &ldquo;doles&rdquo; used very loosely by all parties in this House.  There is no dole given to anyone to-day in this country and there has not been any dole for years.  The position to-day is, before a man is entitled to draw one penny of unemployment insurance benefit he must have at least a minimum of twelve stamps to his credit.  Before he can have his twelve stamps to his credit he must get at least three months' work; assuming that at the end of that three months he becomes unemployed and fulfills the other conditions laid down, he is entitled to twelve days' unemployment benefit, a day's payment for every stamp to his credit and no more.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out with regard to the maximum allowed under the existing Act, if a man has been employed for seven or eight years constantly and has to his credit three hundred, four hundred or five hundred stamps and is then unfortunate enough to be thrown out of employment for twelve months the maximum benefit allowed to him in any one year is 156 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the six waiting days I agree with Deputy Lemass that I do not see the necessity for it.  So far as national health insurance is concerned the waiting period is only three days, but it is even worse than that. If a man has put in four of his six waiting days and then gets a day's work he has to start all over again, <Col N="643" /> and naturally rather than do that many men are inclined to refuse a day's work, so that they can complete in a day or two their six waiting days, because if men do one day's work they have to wait six days after before they can qualify, and as we know in some of the county districts it might be a month and even six weeks before a man gets his first payment.  That is a fact.  This surplus has been brought about, in my opinion, first and foremost by a very drastic reduction of the benefits to which the unemployed men and women were entitled before this State was set up; secondly, I believe, to better and greater compliance with the Act, and on that I am all with the Minister and only hope that he will keep pushing for even greater compliance. I have mentioned this matter here in this House on a good many occasions for the last seven or eight years.  Then we have got to remember also that up to the end of 1928 men or women who had reached the age of 65 years and had a certain number of stamps to their credit were entitled to are fund on their contributions plus two and a half per cent. compound interest. The Minister wiped that out, I think, at the end of 1928.  I say it is most unfair that money, if I might use the word in this connection, seeing that we are still £300,000 in debt, that has been gathered together in that way at the expense of those who are unemployed, should be used for the benefit of those who are employed and for their employers.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point. Perhaps this might appeal to some of the farmer Deputies in this House.  As the result of very drastic reductions which were made in the rates of benefit which existed at the time the State was set up, and reducing it down to a day's pay for every stamp to every man's credit, those men were compelled, having no unemployment benefit to get, and unable to get employment, to apply for home help, and the county boards of help and the relieving officers were compelled under law, unless they wanted to see those men and their families hungry and <Col N="644" /> starving, to give them relief out of the rates.  I say there is no real saving whatever.  Looking at the matter from a national point of view, it is merely transferring the burden from national taxation to local rates.  I prefer to see it the other way, that rather than being local it should be a national charge.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is, there is really no saving, and I know, speaking for the county which I represent, that a considerable amount of the sum paid out in home help has to be paid out to people, to able-bodied men and their dependents because they cannot get work and they are not entitled to unemployment benefit.  I agree again with Deputy Lemass that it seems to be almost ridiculous to be giving £300,000 for the relief of unemployment and at the same time taking £300,000 from another fund which should be given to relieve unemployment, to give it to those already provided for.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Lemass when he stated that he was hoping that we would be able to amend this Bill in such a drastic way in Committee as to meet what he would like to have brought about, and have this money put to the uses he and I would like to have it put.  I may say, so far as this Party are concerned, we are absolutely satisfied that it would be utterly impossible to amend this Bill to have the money used in the way we want to have it&mdash;that is, for the relief of the unemployed and the destitute. Therefore, we have no other course left to us except to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.  If the fund were solvent, and if the unemployed in this country were getting anything like the unemployment benefit they should get, and are entitled to get, if not only they and their dependents are to be kept alive, the only way to use this money is to use it in their interests and those who are not provided for, and for that reason we will vote against this Bill because, under this Bill, you cannot provide that this money will go to the unemployed. If the Dáil agrees to the Second Reading of this Bill, then, in the opinion of this Party, the Dáil is committed to the spending of this <Col N="645" /> money in the interests of those who, I say, are already provided for.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Morrissey in opposing the Second Reading of the Bill.  We all know the difficulty of reimposing any contribution that may be taken off at any given time.  I feel, with Deputy Morrissey, that rather than reduce the contributions paid by the employed and the employer we should seek to increase the benefits.  My experience is similar to that of Deputy Morrissey.  So far as Cork City is concerned, at any rate, I have had no complaints whatsoever, either from employers or employees, about the rate of contributions, but I have had several complaints from the employees, and indeed from some very decent employers, that the unemployment benefits which operate elsewhere, the uncovenanted benefits, as they are sometimes called, do not obtain in our own country.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the case which I would commend to the Minister's attention.  Would it not be far better to employ any surplus that may accrue to this fund in ameliorating other social conditions?  Even if the fund, as we are now told, is solvent, would it not be better to continue the old rate of contribution and extend the benefits, or, if not to extending the benefits, to employ the money so accumulated in other ways.  It might so strengthen the Central Fund that we might be able, one of these days, to pay something towards widows' and orphans' pensions, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I would like the Minister to take into consideration before this Bill reaches the Committee Stage, if it does reach the Committee Stage.  It is the fact that men discharged from the National Army are not able to draw anything from the unemployment fund, not even in respect of the moneys which they contributed before they joined the Army.  Even though a soldier has contributed for five or six years to this fund he is unable, on discharge from the Army, to draw anything by way of Unemployment Insurance Fund money. There was a provision in the 1920 Act which enabled the Minister to refund contributions paid by persons when they had reached the age of 65.  As <Col N="646" /> Deputy Morrissey has touched upon that matter and elaborated somewhat on it, I do not wish to repeat what he said.  But it is a thing that should be commended, and I commend it to the Minister's attention, that something should be done to restore this provision which enabled employed contributors to this Unemployment Insurance Fund to get a refund of their money, plus a certain rate of interest, on attaining the age of 65.</P>
    <P>Under the old Acts&mdash;I think it was Section 8, sub-section (4) of the 1920 Act&mdash;provision was made for the case I mention of ex-army men and others. I see in the remission of these contributions one danger perhaps that is more important than any of the others, that is that once you take off a contribution of this character you will find it very difficult to reimpose it, I feel that there are other avenues through which distress should be relieved than by reducing the contribution at present paid by those who are lucky enough, as Deputy Morrissey said, to be in employment, and in reducing the contribution paid by employers who have to pay this contribution, even though, as Deputy Good said, it might mean a reduction in their losses, though I have very great doubt as to the number who are living on their losses.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that it is about time that we had a complete revision of this kind of legislation or rather legislation dealing with unemployment and unemployed persons.  The one peculiar anomaly is even though a person were employed five, six or seven years on his becoming unemployed he could only draw 156 days in any one year.  Again, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, he must have twelve stamps to his credit.  In other words, he must have worked for at least three months before again becoming entitled to unemployment benefit.  I feel at any rate, with all the members of our Party, that we cannot support a measure of this kind.  We feel that instead of reducing the contributions paid by both parties to the fund the number of days in which unemployed persons should receive benefit should be increased.  In fact, I would go further than that and say it would be <Col N="647" /> incumbent on the State if they do not feel in the position to provide work for the unemployed, at least, to see to it that the unemployed man or woman who is willing to work and cannot get it should have some kind of financial assistance during their period of unemployment.  For these reasons, amongst others, I am not prepared to support this measure, and intend to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeatedly from these benches we have raised the question of reciprocal arrangements in regard to unemployment insurance benefit between the Government on the one hand and the British Government and the Government of the Six Counties on the other, and the Minister has told us that as far as lay in his power he endeavoured to get reciprocal arrangements entered into.  I have come to the conclusion, as a result of this Bill being introduced to-day by the Minister, that he was not sincere in regard to those remarks.  It is well known that quite a large number of workers go across to England, Scotland or Wales, or across the Border into the Six Counties, and work in insurable occupations.  Having worked there for quite long periods they find when they return to the Saorstát that they are denied any benefits from the British Unemployment Insurance Fund, the Six County Unemployment Insurance Fund or the Free State Unemployment Insurance Fund.  I have pointed out repeatedly in this House that, in my opinion, the reason why neither Miss Bondfield, the British Minister of Labour, nor Mr. Andrews, the Six Counties Minister of Labour, will not enter into reciprocal arrangements is owing to the fact that the benefits that we pay are at a lower rate than the benefits paid in England, Scotland, Wales or the Six Counties.  I understand that the Six Counties Minister for Labour has already informed the Minister's Department that as far as the Six Counties are concerned they are prepared to enter into reciprocal arrangements with the Saorstát Government as soon as the Government here are prepared to bring up their benefits to the rates that are being paid in the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister did not interrupt I could develop the argument in such a way that he would come to the conclusion it was good.  I believe if the Minister increased the benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act, reciprocal arrangements could have been entered into as far as the Six County Government is concerned. The Minister told us that when he entered into negotiations with Miss Bondfield, the British Minister for Labour, she stated that she was not prepared to enter into reciprocal arrangements because there were greater numbers of workers who went to England, Scotland and Wales than came from these countries to the Saorstát. The Minister said here that in order to get reciprocal arrangements for unemployment insurance benefit it would cost the State £33,000.  By the savings effected under this Act, the Minister, if he so desired, could agree to pay that £33,000.  As a result large numbers of workers who emigrate from Mayo and Donegal and other counties to England, Scotland and Wales and who work there in insurable occupations and have week after week unemployment insurance contributions deducted from their wages, could, when they come back to live in the Saorstát, become entitled to unemployment insurance benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> I was sorry when the Minister decided to recast the Unemployment Insurance Act that he did not endeavour to recast it in such a way as would bring those employed in the agricultural industry&mdash;I refer to agricultural workers&mdash;under the Unemployment Insurance Act, even in a modified form.  I think the Minister will admit that this measure when it was first introduced in the British House of Commons was framed to suit the needs of Britain, and it must be recognised as far as Britain is concerned that the number engaged in industrial occupations is much greater than the numbers employed in agricultural pursuits in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In this country it is the other way about.  Although the greatest numbers of workers are employed in agriculture you find what is known as the Unemployment Insurance Act does not apply to the most deserving class, the agricultural workers.  I intend to vote against this Bill, although I realise that it might confer a little benefit on some employees to have their contributions reduced.  I think the Minister would have done much better by aiming at the greatest good for the greatest number.  He could have done that by continuing to keep the contributions as they are and by giving extended benefit.  He could have also wiped out the cheese-paring policy in regard to the administration of the present Act, under which large numbers of applicants who ordinarily should be entitled to benefit are refused benefits when they apply for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday week, when the President came here with his propagandist statement I suggested, when criticising that statement, that it would have been much more honest if, instead of indicating his intention to introduce this Bill and reduce the subscriptions to the Unemployment Fund, he would indicate a more sincere appreciation of the problem of unemployment by expressing his intention to extend the benefits to the unemployed.  I am very glad the Labour Party has taken up that attitude.  I want to re-echo everything Deputy Morrissey has said in <Col N="650" /> that connection.  I would like to ask the Minister what is meant by stating that this is a benefit to the employee and the employer.  We were told by the President last week that this would be a great fillip to industry.  Has there been any representation from industrialists in this country for this reduction in subscriptions to the Unemployment Fund?  I think I can undertake to say there have certainly been no representations made on that score from any representatives of the employees.  I can undertake further to say that those in employment are quite prepared to continue paying the contribution to the Unemployment Fund simply because they have no guarantee that to-morrow they themselves may not be thrown on the unemployed market.  They have no objection to paying the contribution provided that it will mean further assistance to the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I cannot believe that this is intended seriously as even a sop to the employed workers.  Threepence per week as a contribution certainly may mean something to the big industrialists, but are they not well able to bear the present burden?  Up to the present we have had no complaint from any source about this contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  If there have been secret representations made by the industrialists we should be told from what source they emanate.  Side by side with the President's flourish of trumpets, when he told us this great reduction would mean a fillip to industry and save the employed workers the munificent sum of threepence a week, he mentioned that he found it necessary to introduce a relief grant of £300,000.  Where is the consistency?  You have a sum of £300,000 in relief and a reduction in the Unemployment Fund.  That is another form of window dressing in order to show, what he himself stated, that we were the only country in Europe having an Unemployment Insurance Fund in such a healthy condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat what I said last Wednesday, that if the Government wish to interest themselves seriously in the welfare of those of the majority&mdash;of those for whom this fund was originally <Col N="651" /> intended&mdash;they should withdraw this Bill and introduce a measure extending the period of benefit.  We should, each and all of us, bear in mind what the original purpose and original intentions of the Unemployment Insurance Act was.  That Act was for the purpose of insuring the workers against unemployment.  It was not an Act introduced for the purpose of building up a fund which, for some particular period, would be used to give a fillip to industry and be a benefit to employers.  There was never any such intention expressed when this Act was originally introduced.  Surely it will be agreed that it is primarily an Act to secure the workers against unemployment. That being so, and the fund being in this condition in which we are told now it is, so as to be able to afford this reduction, why not be consistent and carry out the spirit in which the Act was originally brought into being and increase the benefits to those for whom it was introduced?</P>
    <P>There are, as has been pointed out by several speakers from the Labour Benches, many anomalies in the present Act.  I think Deputy Lemass dealt with this point also, and it is one which requires remedying.  An insured worker pays unemployment insurance for a period during which he or she is employed, be it one, two, ten or fifteen years, and then through no fault on his or her part becomes unemployed.  They are only permitted to draw 156 days' unemployment benefit.  Then they are denied any further benefit for a period of three months.  One cannot possibly see the justice of that, particularly in the case of people who have been paying into the fund for long periods.  There is no provision made to meet that. That applies with equal force to the person who has been paying into the fund for ten or fifteen years, just as it applies to the person who is only due to come into benefit.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw this Bill and try and reconsider the position from the humane point of view, from the point of view of the people whom it was intended first of all to assist.  He will find that there are many avenues <Col N="652" /> through which he can use the money which is now available on account of the healthy state of the fund.  He can do that without reducing contributions. Reducing contributions is not the best way of dealing with the present situation. If the contributions are now reduced is it feasible to expect that under, another set of circumstances he can come before the House and expect that he can have them increased? There is no demand for this reduction of contributions, and it will not serve any real genuine purpose.  The principle of the Bill is what I am primarily concerned with.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this measure and try to find other ways of using that available money for the benefit of those who are first entitled to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with this Bill in many respects.  I must disagree with Deputy Cooney altogether when he states that employers ought not to receive any consideration whatever from the Government.  Does Deputy Cooney realise that in one particular industry alone overhead charges have a very big influence on the estimates submitted by those engaged in that particular industry? Take, for instance, housing.  When a builder makes an estimate for a housing contract he has to take everything into consideration, and amongst other things there will be unemployment insurance. If there is a reduction in the amount payable by the employer, naturally, he will be able to send in a lower tender.  Is not that a help towards cheapening the cost of house building in this country, which I am sure, judging by the shortage of houses, is a real necessity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the idea that seems to prevail throughout this country that employers and employees are two different sets of people altogether and that their interests are not identical. I hold the opinion as a trade unionist of long standing that what is good for the employer is in many cases good also for the employee.  I am a member of a trade union for the past 33 years. I do not look upon the employers as the enemy.  The capitalist is a friend to the worker&mdash;to the man who has to <Col N="653" /> do his work&mdash;by upholding the interest of the particular industry in which he is engaged.</P>

      <P>The only criticism I would like to offer is that the Minister has not succeeded in having some agreement with the British Government in regard to those workers who have, of necessity, at different periods of the year to emigrate to England, Scotland or Wales.  These workers have perhaps 150 or 200 stamps to their credit before they emigrate from the Free State.  They go over to England and work there for some time, and, perhaps, through a shortage of work they are forced to come back again. They find they are not entitled to the unemployment benefit.  I have known workers from the Free State who, when out of work here, put in their claim at the local labour exchange and were awarded the maximum amount of benefit, which is somewhere in the vicinity of 156 days.  These workers very often instead of loitering about here in the Free State drawing six months' benefit preferred to cross over to England in search of work.  It is a hardship that when these men come back they will not receive any unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that one of the conditions required for the granting of benefit is that a man must have 12 stamps here.  In other words, he must have worked for 12 weeks.  I think that is a distinct hardship, and if the Minister could make arrangements with the Government of Great Britain that would do away with this hardship I think it would meet with the approval of the workers of this country in general, especially that section of the workers who have been going over to England.  This unemployment insurance is a very intricate question, and it is one which has created difficulties <Col N="654" /> in all countries.  The Act is very difficult of interpretation, and it is one which, in my opinion, has conferred, and I suppose, if wisely looked after, will confer great benefits on the workers.  I think, taking everything into consideration, that the Government is, in my opinion, to be congratulated in having introduced this Bill.  I hold that anything that tends to lessen the cost of production is good for the country in general.  When we consider the resources of this country I think there should be general agreement on all sides that before there can be any appreciable reduction in the amount of unemployment it will be necessary that the cost of everything in general in regard to our industries must come down.  That is the opinion I have held for a very considerable time, and I am strengthened in that opinion from the experience of the past seven or eight years.  We all talk about the creation of work and everything else but we have the example to-day even in Great Britain, where there is in power a Government friendly to the working classes, yet they are up against a very difficult proposition, and one they find it more difficult to solve than they contemplated.  I am not criticising the Labour Government; I am a friend of Labour, but I always look at things from the position I am placed in myself.  And I think the time has arrived when there should be less inclination or tendency to create the impression that employers, as a rule, are the enemies of the working classes, and vice versa.  No such thing.  It is only by co-operation between both that we can go ahead and overcome the difficulties that exist in this country as in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall ask the members of our Party to go into the Lobby with the Labour Party against this Bill.  The speech that we listened to might well be made against unemployment insurance in general. Every argument that has been put forward could be put forward against the whole idea of unemployment insurance. From the moment that we had the first intimation from the President of the solvency of the Unemployment Insurance Fund it surprised <Col N="655" /> me very much to be told that the solvency of the fund was to be used in this way, because it seemed to me the natural thing that this strong position of the fund should be used in some way to extend the benefits to the unemployed.  This Bill is intended to help undoubtedly on the one hand the employer and on the other the person employed, and actually working.  As I said, one would imagine that any money available should be used to extend the benefits to the unemployed in the present conditions. I think it has been open, under the Act, to the Minister, at any time, to vary the rates and the period of unemployed benefit.  It was open to the Minister to raise the rates and to diminish the period if he thought the necessity of keeping the fund solvent required it.  Now conversely, it seems to me it should follow that when the fund is in a condition in which the period could be extended that we should use it in that way.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned this is a very simple matter.  This fund was intended to provide insured persons against a period of unemployment, and to my mind, it should be strained even to the point of solvency so as to give the greatest possible benefit to the people it was intended to benefit.  The money available is not being used in that way, and that is my reason for asking our Party to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy has a lot to learn.  I am as anxious as anybody to lower the overhead expenses of industry in this country, but surely that should not be done out of the savings of the unemployed.  That may be a peculiar statement, but that certainly is the position, because it is due to the tightening up of the Unemployment Insurance Act that this fund is <Col N="656" /> now approaching solvency.  For the past four or five years, it was almost impossible for a man living in a rural area and working on the roads for the county council to get benefit.  Time and time again questions have been put from various parts of this House in connection with the claims of men who work on the roads for about nine months out of the year to know why they do not get benefit.  The reason invariably put forward by the Minister is that the man has two or three acres of land.  I cannot understand how the Minister could expect a man to be able to keep himself and a wife and family out of a couple of acres of land. I know an industrious man who tries to till his land in his spare time.  He has to keep himself in vegetables and other things, and finds it necessary to go to the county council and work on the roads.  I know one particular case that came under my notice in the last month in my own constituency, where a man had been working for the railway company as a casual worker&mdash;he was almost permanent, I may say.  He had practically ten months' employment in the year, and he had twelve children, and because he had three or four acres of land he was denied unemployment benefit.  In God's name, how could that man be expected to maintain himself and his wife and twelve children out of three or four acres of land?</P>
      <P>The tightening up at that particular stage of the Unemployment Insurance Act, and it has been tightened up very much, is responsible for the position in which we are to-day, when the President said that the fund was reaching to a state of solvency.  We also have the case of a man working on the roads in a rural area who might be lucky enough to pay £2 or £3 for a horse and cart.  That man is working the greater part of the year on the roads.  He becomes unemployed, makes application for unemployment insurance benefit.  He has been stamping his cards and he is now refused unemployment benefit.  He is looked on as a contractor.  I think there is a very big difference between a man of that type and a contractor.  If relief is to be afforded to anybody it is to people of that type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Deputy Cassidy referred to the fact that no reciprocal arrangement was made between the Free State and the Government of the Six Counties and the British Government.  I think that the Minister was very lax as far as that is concerned.  One would like to know while he was over in London for five or six weeks in the present year if any representations were made in the course of the Conference there on behalf of the people for whom we desire reciprocal arrangements.  There are a number of sailors in this country and a very large number in my own constituency and they have perforce to go across to the other side in order to get a berth.  They come home after two or three years' voyage.  Their cards are stamped with British stamps; they have had to pay Unemployment Insurance and National Health Insurance.  If they are idle two or three months they cannot draw any benefit.  It is particularly hard upon those people at the moment, in view of the fact that unemployment prevails very widely in the shipping centres and that there are hundreds of ships lying idle in Liverpool, Cardiff and other ports.  Many of these ships were manned by Irish sailors.  They are unemployed now and yet they cannot get the unemployment benefit.  It is a great hardship, and the Government, if it does not attend to a matter of that kind, shows a certain amount of laxity towards its citizens.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a point raised by Deputy Cooney, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Anthony, and that is the question of the qualifying period for benefit.  There are men who have worked for fourteen or fifteen years and who never had a day's idleness during that time, but who, when the slump came, became unemployed, and when these men were idle for about twelve months their insurance stamps immediately became ineffective. That is a great hardship.  If the Minister has this money to spare, surely it is cases of that kind that should be relieved.  I know of a particular case in my constituency where a large industry was closed down last year.  The men had been working there since the Act came into operation <Col N="658" /> in 1911.  The firm went into liquidation, and during the last year of its life the men's cards were not stamped. They became unemployed and not one of them was entitled to benefit.  That matter has been reported to the Department, but nothing has been done. These men are now walking the streets and are receiving no benefit, notwithstanding the fact that they have been stamping their cards since the advent of the Insurance Act in 1911.  If there is money available, it is cases such as these that should be taken into consideration. The Labour Party, and I am sure other parties, are as anxious as Deputy Coburn to cut down overhead expenses in industry, but, as I said, it should not be done at the expense of the unemployed who have paid insurance contributions for a lengthy period and are disqualified by reason of certain clauses of this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a statement that a man with a few acres of land who had paid his contributions each week to the Unemployment Insurance Fund has been denied benefit. The circumstances govern each case, of course, but I know for a fact that men who were engaged in an insurable occupation and who also had a few acres of land have received unemployment benefit.  I do not think, therefore, that as a rule this fund is administered so tightly as to deprive such men of benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaint has been made that I did not give certain figures in connection with this matter that I might have been expected to give and, by way of interruption, I said that I had already given the figures required. However, in case they have been lost sight of, I shall give them again.  At one time the fund was in debt to the extent of £1,300,000 odd&mdash;over one and a quarter millions.  It has been in successive years reduced by reason of the fact that the income, taking the average for the last two or three years, exceeds outgoings by about £330,000. The fund is, or will be on 1st January next, about £300,000 in debt.  If we continue going on as we are going on for another year we would wipe out that deficit and have, as Deputy Morrissey said, about £35,000 in hand. <Col N="659" /> The reduction that we propose averages threepence on the part of the employer and threepence on the part of the employee.  It is different in the case of women, but it tots up, between men, women and children, to a saving to the employer and the employee of about £224,000 in the year, and a saving to the State of something over £60,000.  The effect on the insured person, therefore, is that he pays less and gets exactly the same benefit as before.  The individual insured person pays less&mdash;threepence if he is a man, twopence if a woman, and 1½d. in the case of children.  As far as benefit is concerned, it is exactly the same.</P>
      <P>It was said by one speaker that this was a very dubious type of operation&mdash; financing or subsidising industry out of borrowed money.  In fact, what we are doing is stopping that practice. For several years past industry has been paying off by reason of the fact that at one time it was subsidised out of borrowed money.  There was a time when the fund went into debt, and if a subsidy had not been given both to the industrialist and his employees at that time, the contributions would have had to be raised.  They were not raised; the money was borrowed, and the deficit has been wiped off by degrees. We think that at this particular point, with business somewhat on the up-grade, it is well to give whatever fillip there may be, and I think it is a considerable fillip, by handing back to these people who are paying into, not merely an unemployment fund, but an unemployment insurance fund, moneys that are being taken from them to a larger extent than is required, to give the exact benefit they are being given to-day, under the same conditions in which they are now being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defects in the Insurance Fund have been pointed out.  All of them are urged by people who take up a different point of view with regard to this fund from our point of view.  We regard this as an unemployment fund and an unemployment insurance fund, and we regard it as the proper type of unemployment insurance system to have for the ordinary type of unemployment that happens in ordinary <Col N="660" /> periods of industrial activity in countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ordinary period is not there, then the abnormal circumstances ought to be met by abnormal methods, not by an unemployment insurance fund, not by a tax upon industry, first and foremost on industry, as this fund is.  Hence the arguments that have been used against the waiting period, against the fact that only six months' benefit can be paid in any year irrespective of the number of contributions to a man's credit, are irrelevant to people who have the point of view with regard to this Bill that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting period has been referred to, and the argument used that in the six-day waiting period a man often neglects the chance to get one day's work because he would interrupt the waiting period and have to start the six days all over again.  If people object to six days and plump for three days, I do not know why they should not cut down the time to the next day.  Certainly the same interruption would be caused in a three-day period, and the same man would as easily abandon a single day's work if it would interrupt the three-day period.  There is not the same pressure exactly, but there is pressure.  I should like people who are considering this, not in the abnormal circumstances of countries that are in abnormal states of unemployment, but in the ordinary way, to think where the six-day waiting period came from.  It came from the trade unions.  It was borrowed by the British Government, when the Unemployment Insurance Scheme was being established, from the trade union practice, which was that where members, who then used to receive benefit from trade union funds, fell out of employment they were kept waiting for a week, because the trade unions' attitude towards their own members at that time was that if it were only a week's unemployment a man was suffering he really should have enough in hand to <Col N="661" /> get over that, and that the week was a thing they did not regard.  The system was borrowed from the trade unions and the trade unions' practice prior to the establishment of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  I am aware that it was due to the fact that it was the trade union practice at the time.  Their attitude was that if the unemployment lasted only for the week it was not worth considering.  They thought a mail had enough on hands to tide over that period.  If that is denied here by certain people, I believe that my statement can be verified.  With regard to the period of six months' maximum benefit, that is again a very good safeguard in an ordinary unemployment insurance system.  You must put some incentive on people to look for work and the incentive is there, namely, that if they remain out of work apart from all other things, they will be paid only up to a maximum of six months.  They know when they enter into the scheme that this is the maximum and that no matter what stands to their credit they will have to space out the benefit to the best advantage, because they will only get six months' benefit in any one year.  To change that would involve not only the <Col N="662" /> £300,000 we are seeking at the moment, but it would require a complete actuarial calculation and a complete revision of the whole scheme.</P>
      <P>Several people think that we are decreasing taxation by the £64,000 taken out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We are keeping the scheme in the proportion that the State paid before, but we do hold, just as the State was previously mulcted by paying towards the insurance scheme, in proportion to the contributions from the two parties mainly concerned&mdash; the employer and the insured persons &mdash;that now when their contributions have been reduced, the State has a right to expect some reduction also. Deputy Lemass feels that we are getting not merely £64,000, but an additional £20,000.  I have tried to explain the fallacy of that.  At the moment the State pays a certain sum of money as a third party to the scheme.  It pays more and has always paid more than the total amount granted at any time for administration purposes.  Up to date there has been a certain percentage of the total income of the fund set aside for administration.  The actual cost of administration has never been confined to that percentage.  The State has paid to allied services certain sums of money sometimes as low as £20,000 and sometimes as high as £50,000. For the future the State is consolidating those two payments.  The State is being mulcted as before for the same amount, but instead of paying one-third on a certain subtraction from the fund plus a contribution to allied services, it is now paying the total amount in one sum.  The State is getting £64,000 remission and nothing else, and even £64,000 is a bit doubtful. It is not quite correct.  It is the least accurate of the calculations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may not be my fault.  Deputy Murphy spoke of better compliance with the Act.  Better compliance is always urged when there is an increase in the revenue of the funds.  We do not believe there has <Col N="663" /> been any better percentage of compliance in the last five years.  At no time has there been any confusion in regard to compliance.  There has been at all times a reluctance on the part of certain employees to urge their claims, but we do not believe that the number of people who failed to urge their claims has been lessened in any marked way.  There was always that number.  We believe there has been a betterment of the situation, but it has been very, very slight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony wants further social legislation.  I think that claim should be put up independently.  The merits of the case should be argued and when that case is put forward, if there is a case to be made for widows and orphans, it should be made, and we should see the source from which the Deputy thinks the benefits which the Deputy would like for widows and orphans should be drawn.  I would like to hear from him later whether he thinks they should come from industry instead of from the general tax-payer. He should make up his mind on that point before he argues that a scheme which appertains only to industrial workers should proceed to give benefits to a large number of people described as widows and orphans, irrespective of whether the widowhood or orphanhood arose out of industry.</P>
      <P>On the question of ex-National Army men, I am in more sympathy with the Deputy.  We have been trying to get some scheme whereby we could ease the conditions under which ex-National Army men could get back into employment, but there have been administrative difficulties of a very complicated type.  I have not given up hope that some solution will be found, and the cost is not the consideration that keeps a scheme back.  Deputy Cassidy, as usual, has referred to the case of migratory labourers.  I would like to hear the discussion between him and the Trade Union Congress when they read what he has said to-night, because they distinctly stated that they did not believe that there was any force or any cogency in the argument put up by the Minister which the Deputy quoted.</P>

I am still prepared to enter into negotiations with either the British or the Northern Government in regard to this matter, and the seven or eight alternatives which we suggested are still open.  I will wait with interest to see what the outcome will be.</P>
      <P>Statements have been made with regard to the unemployment fund that it was certainly never built up for the purpose of these remissions.  A section of the original Act of 1920 shows distinctly that when the Act was framed the rates were almost experimental. There was a definite promise when the Act was brought in that if it were found that the rates caused a swelling of the fund to a point where it was not required, there would be reductions. Provision was made in a section of the Act that if the fund was sufficient or insufficient changes could be made. The only time at which the point which Deputy de Valera referred to, the point with regard to modifications in respect of periods, would arise would be in the event of the fund becoming insolvent.  If the fund tended to become insolvent, then the rates might be increased and the periods would have been changed adversely to the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy argued from the Act itself, and said that there must have been something in the minds of the framers.  I say that the only way that they envisaged a change being made was in the event of the fund becoming insolvent, and then the change would be adverse to the workers. In another paragraph they looked to a change in the contributions. There they envisaged either a state of insufficiency or of sufficiency in the funds, and they allowed for these remissions. They very definitely looked to a change such as we are now making in the rates if the rates were found to increase the income of the fund beyond the point that was desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been one other point urged <Col N="666" /> against the scheme as a whole but not against the Bill.  That is the point with regard to what is called the entrance fee payable by a man after he drops out of insurable occupation.  The fact has been referred to that a man must have twelve stamps to his credit before he is accounted a worker in insurable occupation and that if he falls out of insurable employment at any time, he must before he re-enters pay a re-entrance fee by way of three months' work.  That is so.  That is a provision in the Act which is quite sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances which I am dealing with are not abnormal. Abnormal circumstances can be dealt with in another way.  I am still sticking rigidly to the fact that this is an unemployment insurance scheme built up in contributions, and that no payments will be made except on foot of contributions to a man's credit.  The whole calculation was based on that, and the twelve stamps and the six waiting days are all factors that have to be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>A point was raised by Deputy Morrissey in regard to the refunds that workers had a right to demand at the age of 60.  Both Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Corish referred to that and said that we had taken away that right.  We did take away that right, but we paid for it.  We said at one time in particular that we were not going to allow these contributions to pile up and allow a man to take them away with interest at a certain time, but we said that on application being made within a limited period, we would wipe out that part of the scheme. We did it on the basis of compensation. We paid the full value of the contributions at a particular time.  The only change we made was that instead of allowing that to go on and pile up until people came to the age of 60, we said: &ldquo;Claim now within the period and we will pay.&rdquo;  We did pay.  If we took the right away we paid for it on the basis of compensation and with interest. There has been no harsh treatment of the insurable contributors on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> I was wondering if this debate could possibly end without reference to the road worker who has two acres of land. I think it remained for the last Deputy who spoke from the Labour Benches to refer to such persons.  The way that Deputy Corish expressed it was that these road workers were ruled out of benefit because the Minister said that the men had a couple of acres.  The Minister never says anything with regard to these people.  The Umpire says it.  The Umpire has to decide whether these people fulfil the statutory conditions. One of the statutory conditions is: &ldquo;Is the man really unemployed; is he available for occupation, and is no other occupation open to him?&rdquo; On that the Umpire is quite independent of my office and he does not depend on instructions issued from the office.  He, as an independent judge on these matters, has to decide the claim, and takes into consideration everything that a man should take into consideration in these cases, namely, the previous history, the time of the year, the extent of his holding, the type of the soil, etc.  If the Umpire decides that at a particular period of the year that type of person would be classed as employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That does not come into the consideration.  If he were badly paid he might be harder on the claimant.  This matter has been raised on many occasions and time and again I have asked that the individual cases should be given to me even by the bundle.  I stated over and over again that 75 per cent. of the people who hold land are settled with straight away, and that a certain percentage have to go through a Court of Referees and the Umpire.  Some are determined against the applicant, and some are determined in his favour. It is a strange circumstance that I have asked for returns over and over again, and that, in this year, there have been less than 170 <Col N="668" /> people to date turned down because they are, as the phrase runs, &ldquo;not unemployed.&rdquo;  That phrase covers those of the landholders who would be turned down.  That figure would more than cover the land people.</P>
      <P>The other point raised was the question of the £300,000.  It has been said that there is no consistency in reducing unemployment insurance contributions and expending £300,000, divided between the employer, the employee and the State in the proportions that have been stated, and at the same time coming forward with the Relief Vote or £300,000.  There are two points on which that can be argued.  First of all it was alleged that the group of people for whom relief was required were those who had been affected in an agricultural way by the bad conditions of this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has a motion on the Order Paper stating that the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should do various things &ldquo;so as to enable unemployed men and small farmers who have been seriously affected by bad harvests and the fall in wholesale prices to earn a livelihood during the coming winter and spring.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Connell has in mind the type of people for whom we intend mainly the £300,000 by way of relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will leave it that Deputy O'Connell did not mean it.  We did.  The people who are seriously affected, and for whom plaint has been made at this time this year, are agriculturists, and it is on their behalf that we intend most of the £300,000 should be expended.  What we are dealing with now is another type of relief.  Although the 3d. per week has been derided by a number of people, it is some measure of relief in the case of various people.  It is some substantial relief in the total relief given to industry, relief that has often been demanded, despite what has been <Col N="669" /> said by Deputy Cooney.  Representations have frequently been made that this was one of the burdens pressing upon industry.  Reverting to the line of argument on which I started, this unemployment insurance scheme has to deal with normal conditions.  Our idea is that the normal conditions with regard to unemployment in this country, the conditions that we have at the moment in insurable occupations, allow us to make this reduction of almost £300,000.</P>
      <P>There are abnormal circumstances affecting other portions of the community, and we deal with them in an abnormal way.  We have our £300,000 Relief Vote, and that is the only way in which these things can be segregated. There must be a definite distinction made between normal conditions and the things that occur now and again.  We think that having that fund built up by the employers and employees in industry, when it gets to the point that the income is in excess of the outgoings by about £330,000 per annum, that then it is time to reduce the contributions while at the same time keeping benefits as they are. I think the scheme is sound in the benefits that we give.  I cannot say that I have not heard complaints with regard to the smallness of the benefits, but I certainly have not heard any great volume of complaint with regard to that.  I have heard a great deal of complaint that the whole scheme has not been extended to cover people who were not covered by the insurance scheme.  I have heard the complaint that it should be turned into a system of dole, a thing which it has never been in this country.  We would regard that as a bad way of facing up to abnormal circumstances.  We prefer always to have industry dealt with in a normal way by ordinary legislation running over a number of years, and when abnormal circumstances come about, then to meet them by way of relief votes or other temporary expedients. There were three other points raised, but as these will fall for consideration on the Committee Stage of the Bill I am not going to deal with them now.</P>

Seeing that the Minister is not willing to amend the legislation, so as to include these people for insurance benefit, would he consider the  of allowing their contributions to accrue, as was the case in the earlier Acts, so that they could receive the accumulated amount with 2½ per cent. compound interest when they came to the age of 60?  According to the terms of the Act as it stands, they are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefit.  Surely they are entitled to their accumulated contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies on the Labour Benches who spoke concerning the unemployed of the Twenty-Six Counties regret to say, even though it may appear strange to most Deputies in this House who know nothing about the unemployed, who have not the means to keep themselves, their wives and children within the means of common decency, that it is not at all adequate to deal with the problem. There are Deputies who would nearly ask the Labour Party to apologise for attempting to tell the people of this country there is such a thing as the unemployment problem.  Deputy Davis, last night, stated that the Labour Party should not magnify the problem. I would like to tell the Deputy that the Labour Party in this House has never attempted to magnify the problem, because the lack of interest taken in that problem by the powers that be is enough to make the problem magnify itself, and the Labour Party know something about the lot of a man who has to keep a wife and children, without having the necessaries of life.  The well-groomed Deputy Davis from Mayo, who, apparently, looks as if he never was without a decent meal, knows simply nothing about the unemployment problem.  During the discussion he showed that he did not know anything and did not believe that there was such a problem in his own constituency. He did not suggest a waterworks, a sewerage or any other social scheme that would make for health and happiness, apart from finding employment for the people in his own constituency.  Of course, that is characteristic of the mind of the Deputy, and probably of some of the people of his constituency, with regard to questions such as home help, employment or any other works that go to benefit the working class.  The Minister, speaking yesterday, said that the live register shows something like 20,000 people unemployed.  Three hundred and sixty thousand acres of land have gone out of tillage this year. If there were only one man employed to 20 acres, would we not at least have 15,000 or 20,000 agricultural workers in <Col N="675" /> this country this year unemployed who were not unemployed before, and they have not appeared on the register?</P>
      <P>Take the question of railway workers on the permanent way.  In the last fortnight or three weeks, between five and six hundred railwaymen have been unemployed and 4,000 have been disemployed since amalgamation. If those were added to the 20,000 on the live register surely the problem is magnified enough without being exaggerated. Deputy Davis stated that he was surprised that the Labour Party did not accuse the Government of the weather conditions in this country.  I may remind the Deputy that if the Government had power to deal with the Clerk of the Weather and they had only dealt with him in the manner they had dealt with the unemployment problem weather conditions in this country would have been no better than they are to-day.  Is it surprising that we have such an unemployment problem in this country?  Look around on all sides; instead of finding prosperous conditions for the working-class and the people generally, what is the position?  The farmer is not able to pay his rates and annuities, due to bad prices.  Of course I might also include the bad conditions with regard to the weather.  We have our manufacturing concerns closing down and some are already dead.  Nothing has been done to give a help to these industries, to employ our own people in producing things for our own requirements.</P>
      <P>Everything we use in this country comes from abroad.  Take the housing question.  We import into this country thousands of pounds worth of cement, steel, slates, bricks and timber.  Is it any wonder there is an unemployment problem when we are employing the foreigner to supply us with things we can produce ourselves?  People will say that the unemployment problem is only a fad of the Labour Party.  The Labour Party always contended that relief schemes were not solutions to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency we have inexhaustible supplies of the best granite and limestone.  These are all left there. We could employ thousands of people to get materials to build our houses. <Col N="676" /> We prefer to get in the materials from abroad and send our people away or leave them starving in their own country. Nobody likes to see the people in this country unemployed, because we know that the unemployed problem not alone in this country but in any other country in the world is a thorn in the heart of the progress of that country, whether it be a highly protective country like America or a free trade country like England.  Because of the old capitalistic system that has radically failed the same thing applies. There are 4,000,000 unemployed in America and over one and a half million across the Channel.  We have over 50,000 in this little country and our population per 100 acres is the smallest in the world.  Unemployment, poverty and a complete derangement of social and economic conditions are but the natural sequel of national waste.  Until this country develops our native resources, until we employ our people in supplying the requirements we can produce as well as any other country in the world we are bound to go down against foreign competition.  Is it not evident that if we are to spend our money in getting our requirements from foreign countries we are going to crush out our own industries?  This was done under an alien Government and our native Government are going on the same lines.  If the Government were serious they could give employment to every man in this country. Why could we not do with other things what has been done for beet, for instance? I do concede that the beet industry for Carlow has been the greatest boon to the people in that county.  I make no apologies for saying that.  Why cannot that be done for wheat, oats and barley and the other things that we consume in this country?  The argument is put up that it would be a terrible cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>You would want to have a President in every constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so much a President in every constituency.  Take Germany, take Australia or any other of these countries that will not allow into their country the things that they can produce themselves.  They have become the greatest nations on the face of the <Col N="677" /> earth.  Our economists are telling us to give up producing our own requirements, to let them come into the country duty free, and that everything will be cheap.  But they are selling the loaf, for instance, as cheap in these countries as in Free Trade England. If the 20,000 people that are said to be unemployed were employed at 30/- a week each, the purchasing power of the country would be enormously increased, and there would be a greater demand for eggs, butter, bacon, milk and the other things that make life worth living for us.  But we, in our blind folly, think it better to allow all these things to come in, to keep our people unemployed and to introduce relief schemes to tide them over starvation periods.  In my own constituency, the position in Carlow is not bad, but in Bagenalstown, Tullow, Hacketstown, Callan, Graigue-na-managh and other places, the starvation is written on the people'e faces.  Yet we are told we are magnifying the position.  Deputy Davis, I notice, has left.  I think I have most effectively dealt with him.  I might say in reference to the Deputy that it is only characteristic of him, because I read some time ago that the board of health in his constituency sent a blind person with a tag on his neck, like a piece of merchandise, to a Dublin hospital. They could not afford to send somebody with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sewerage schemes for Muine Beag and Tullow are an absolute necessity. In Tullow they have not even a water supply although there is a population of over 1,000, and recently a creamery has been built there.  Considerable sums of money have been expended because of outbreaks of typhoid, scarlatina and other diseases.  The position in Muine Beag is different, because in that town they have a water supply, but the sewerage system is more primitive. I would ask the Minister to consider the health of the people.  Public health is much more important than bank balances or the national credit. Bank balances and all these things are grand to read about in the newspapers, but I think it would be more important to have decent sanitation for our people.  I hope that in allocating this money the Minister will have regard <Col N="678" /> to the particular needs of these parts of my constituency and that there will be no discrimination exercised as regards the unemployed.  I might say that we would do with the £300,000, and I would then say: &ldquo;Follow me down to Carlow and Kilkenny.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clery</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is expected from the opposite benches that we should with great rejoicing welcome this Vote of £300,000 for the relief of distress in different parts of the country. I think it is most lamentable, after so many years of those expedients and huge expenditure on Government services that the sole result of Government policy seems to be simply relief schemes when they find things are pretty bad in the country. Schemes of this kind, to my mind, are wrong in principle, and usually they are bad in the working out.  They very seldom bring fruitful results.  The people who talked from the Government Benches yesterday evening would have us believe that the existing conditions are not the outcome of the Government neglect of the affairs of this country.  I think it will be admitted by all thinking men that one bad season alone would not bring the country to the state in which it now is.  In the Twenty-Six Counties we should remember we have only a population of 2,900,000 odd.  We have a population of less than 3,000,000, and with the resources, we have at our disposal, when our credit stands as high as it does&mdash; granting that it is as high as the Government spokesmen say it is&mdash;there should be no necessity, if the Government were in earnest about employment, for a relief Vote which in essence is degrading.  In the olden times the workhouse walls wore based on the principle of relief schemes, and that very system of pauperism has been all along fostered by the present Government. We had relief schemes in previous years, and we found that when a few thousand pounds had been expended a certain amount of that money had to go to engineers and architects, and in similar ways, and after that the portion that went to the people to relieve distress in the various districts was very small.  The number of people whom the money reached was small, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> I think that this time if the Government are at all in earnest about this matter they will get away from that idea of relief schemes.  If the Government set about trying to remedy the causes of distress in the country and bent their energies to it, I am sure they would be more successful in relieving distress and in bringing about success than can be attained through an expenditure of £300,000.  The farming community are in a bad way.  That is only the natural outcome of Government policy during the past five or six years.  Speaking for the County Mayo and the West of Ireland, I must say that if the Government did their duty by the people there would be no necessity for them to introduce this motion here now to give relief to the small farmers.  I say that candidly.  Small farmers in the West of Ireland are workers.  When a small farmer in the West of Ireland can make a living out of eight or ten acres of barren land, and on such a farm can rear a family in pretty bad times, that is proof that they are workers, and that they do not depend on Government relief schemes.  It is only in very exceptional cases that they have to appeal for foreign relief or that they have to appeal for public works.</P>
    <P>The Government should tackle the spending of that money very seriously. If that Department in the Government, which is the laughing stock of the whole country, I refer to the Land Commission, set about their work properly in the last five or six years, and gave back to the people the land out of which they were driven, instead of tying themselves up in red tape in the Government Offices, these small farmers in the West need not now be looking towards relief schemes to tide them over the winter.  Deputy Davis said yesterday that we were inclined to turn this motion into an attack on the Government and a vote of censure on the Government.  I answer that the motion introduced by the VicePresident of the Executive Council is a voluntary vote of censure on themselves on the part of the Government. I challenge any Deputy on the opposite benches to tell me that it is not. <Col N="680" /> From the weather point of view, the season has been very bad, but if the small farmers had been treated in the way they should be treated by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, there would be no necessity at all for bringing in those relief schemes.</P>
    <P>During the past live or six years the farmers who have bank accounts have been drawing on their bank accounts, and the small farmers who have no bank accounts have, to a great extent, been running into debt.  That is what has been going on.  The limit is bound to be reached.  The bad season this year had the effect of bringing them nearer the line and on to the limit than might have otherwise happened had the season been good; but, at any rate, they were going towards that limit already, and their present position, as some Deputies on the opposite benches want to claim, is not the result of the bad season alone.  It is not the bad season alone that is responsible for the distress in the country. Will the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies tell me that if the experts in the Government Departments, in Finance, in Fisheries, and in the Land Commission, took the same interest during the past five or six months in Irish labourers and farmers as they took in the economic situation of the British Empire in London, that they would not have found some better way of improving the position than in the bringing in of this Vote for £300,000?  There have been Ministers over in London for six or seven weeks, and they took a very great interest in Empire matters. You had the best experts in our Government Departments in London too.  They were all divided up into groups discussing the affairs of the British Empire, and we were here at home looking on at the condition to which the farmers and workers of the country were being reduced.  Then when these Ministers come back from London after five or six weeks, the toadies of their Party back them up, and they say that it is a great thing that after five or six months we are getting £300,000 for relief schemes. During that time you had the Ministers and experts in London masquerading with King George in Buckingham Palace, and you had the Minister for <Col N="681" /> Education and the Minister for Fisheries down in Kerry.  It was lamentable to read in the public Press that in one small, little hidden away place in Kerry they had 37 deputations in one day from the farmers' and other associations to tell them of the unfortunate conditions that existed in Kerry. That happened on the very same day on which you had two or three of our Ministers and our experts dining in London at a public function given by British statesmen.</P>
    <P>Then we are told that our credit is high, the highest in the world's money markets, and that our resources are wonderful.  I say that our credit is never higher than the conditions under which the mass of the people exist.  It is very little good for the people to read the speeches in the Press about our credit being high.  It is very little good for them to hear of these things if the credit of this country is not reflected in the lives of the masses of the people and in the conditions under which they live.  And that is not so here.  It is of little benefit to the farmers that some arrangements are made with Portugal to have cheap wines brought into the country.  That is very little good to them.  Their markets, fairs, rents, rates and taxes and the annuities demanded by the Land Commission are of very much more importance to the people of Ireland than these things.</P>
    <P>If the Government did their duty there would be no necessity for relief schemes of this kind.  If the past season had been 25 per cent. worse than it was, it would not affect them so much if the farmers had something to fall back upon and not have empty pockets.  They would then be able to face even a bad season.  They would not find themselves depleted in this stock as they are and they would be able to fight the bad season.  As it is, it is necessary to bring in those relief schemes in order to meet the existing distress.</P>
    <P>I hold that this amount now granted is only like a drop in the ocean.  It will not appreciably relieve distress. Ministers should realise that the West of Ireland is pretty badly hit because migration is no longer allowed.  It was <Col N="682" /> rather fortunate heretofore for the Government that we had emigration, because when workers could not find employment here they obliged the Government by going to America. They obliged the Government still more by sending to this country large sums every year.  The Minister for Finance even admitted that this year the amount sent from America by Irish emigrants will be very much less than last year.  Therefore the country will be the poorer.  It is good, anyhow, that we got the admission from the Minister that if the country were prosperous last year and is poorer this year, it was prosperous last year because of the charity of our friends in America.  It cannot be claimed that it was Government action made the country prosperous.  The Government will have to face the situation that there are additional young people in this country who will not be allowed to go abroad.  There are other things which are very serious.</P>
    <P>I contend that if Departments had done their duty the allocation of this money would not be required at all. If the money is to be given to the Land Commission for distribution I do not know where we will get.  That is the institution which is always considering things but never does anything. It takes the Land Commission about five years to decide what the price of a farm should be; then it takes two years to make a decision about acquiring the land, and it takes another year to tell the people what they are going to do.  I honestly object to the Land Commission being given this £300,000, or even the major portion of it, for the purpose of distributing it. Surely it cannot be claimed that this is part of their work.  The Land Commission, that very expensive snail organisation, should not be kept there simply to carry out relief schemes at a time such as this.  It is not there for the purpose of relieving distress.  The Land Commission has work to do and if it does that work it will have enough to occupy its attention without bothering about relief schemes.</P>
    <P>It is because of the huge failure of the Land Commission in the West of Ireland that we have to look forward <Col N="683" /> to relief schemes like this.  Here is a resolution passed by the Mayo County Council:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the Mayo County Council, having learned of the opportune proposal of the Government to give a grant for the relief of distress, avail of the opportunity to request them to have this grant administered in the Gaeltacht through the county councils, so that it may be devoted principally to the repair of roads formerly constructed by the Irish Land Commission and their predecessors, but which do not comply with the terms of the Local Government Act, 1925, and cannot, therefore, under existing legislation, be taken over by a county council.  Furthermore, we are of opinion that a county council with its local knowledge and its survey staff available will be in a far better position to distribute equitably the grant allowed than any other body.  Grave dissatisfaction was expressed on the occasion of the last distribution in Mayo of a similar grant through the medium of the Irish Land Commission, because of the fact that owing to lack of local knowledge by the officials of the latter body large areas in the county did not participate to any appreciable extent in the distribution of the funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with the members of the Mayo County Council, even though the Chairman of that body, Deputy Davis, spoke in very different terms here last night.  I think the county councillors have better local knowledge than officials of the Land Commission could have.  They could attend to the people's requirements more effectively than could the Land Commission officials.  I do not mean to convey that the officials would not do what they thought best in the locality.  I dare say they would.  In Mayo, however, you have very disgraceful conditions existing, and I suppose the same would apply to other counties also.  There are people living in Mayo with no road accommodation to their houses or lands.  Those things could be dealt with by the county council.  Disgraceful <Col N="684" /> conditions exist in Mayo, and I believe, even though it is a Cumann na nGaedheal county council there, it would still be more effective in administering this grant than would the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It would be more effective to have the money distributed by the county councils in the Gaeltacht, which comprises the greater part of Co. Mayo, The conditions in the Gaeltacht are rather bad, and I expect that applies also to the Gaeltacht in other parts of the country.  The housing grant is being administered there very slowly. I cannot understand why the measure passed in very great haste some time ago has been more or less held up. From Mayo alone there were some two thousand applications received, and in the part of the Gaeltacht to which the Act applies there are only two hundred applications for loans sanctioned.  At a time like this when conditions are so bad surely there should be some speeding up.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening Deputies stated here, and I think the Minister for Local Government said so too, that the fact that outdoor relief is at such a high figure was no indication of a great amount of poverty in the country. Surely when complaints are made about the state of destitution by various boards of health, and when the amount of relief is in most counties at a higher level than ever before, it must naturally follow that destitution is at a high level too.  Deputy Davis made a rather funny statement when he said that the extra outdoor relief in Mayo was caused by the amalgamation schemes passed some years ago and that county councillors are not so anxious to keep down the rates as they are to get into their areas expenditure of every kind.  Am I to take it that the county councillors in Mayo, the majority of whom are Cumann na nGaedheal, are not so anxious about the rates as they are about granting home relief, whether the parties who receive it are or are not in need of it? That is a poor tribute to pay to one's associates, and I am surprised at the Deputy who made that statement; but I dare say any argument is good enough when you are hard up for one. I do not agree that that is the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I know that in the towns and in the country there are very sad cases of destitution.  There is flooding to such an extent that farmers have lost their crops in Mayo.  Potatoes have rotted and oats and hay crops are lost.  A grant of this kind is not going to compensate farmers for their losses.  It is the duty of the Government to approach their different Departments, such as the Land Commission, the Board of Works and the Department of Fisheries, point out to them how badly off are the people in the country, and particularly those on uneconomic holdings, and urge them to speed up their work.  They should encourage officials to tackle their tasks in a serious way. All the red tape, which is given as an excuse for delay in settling the land question, in carrying out drainage work and improving estates, must be pushed aside, to some extent, anyhow. If the Departments were instructed to do the work they should do we would not require any relief schemes.  I would be against any relief scheme if only Departments were urged to do their duty.  Relief schemes to my mind are demoralising, and in the last analysis they have no effect on the situation.</P>

      <P>It amazes me to find that some people cannot be pleased.  Whatever the Government do they grumble at it.  I am delighted that this relief grant of £300,000 has been made available, because in my district there is a large amount of unemployment, especially in Fermoy and Charleville. Within half a mile of Fermoy there are thousands of acres of mountain land which are fit for nothing else but afforestation, and a scheme of afforestation there would give employment to hundreds of men, not alone this year, but for five or even ten years.  We hear a lot these days about motor accidents. To my mind the best way to prevent these accidents is to remove dangerous corners at which most of these accidents occur.</P>

      <P>There are many dangerous corners in every county, and the removal of them would give more employment even than water and sewerage <Col N="686" /> schemes, because the greater part of the money spent would go in labour, whereas in connection with water and sewerage schemes the pipes have to be imported.  At the same time, where water and sewerage schemes are needed it would be a very good way to spend money.</P>

      <P>Nobody interrupted the Deputy when he was making his mournful speech.  Then again there should be a lot of very useful work done on the roads.  Every year we have schemes put forward at the Cork County Council for the improvement of by-roads leading to farmers' houses and I shall do my best to get some of this money for these schemes.  Another thing that money could be very usefully spent on is the reclamation of land.  Land reclamation would be of advantage to the country and to the poor farmers who own the land.  If they got a little money to reclaim their land it would be reproductive expenditure. In Charleville, where there is a population of four or five thousand, there is neither a water nor a sewerage scheme.  It is the smallest dispensary area in the country.  If a grant were given for a water scheme and a sewerage scheme employment could be given not only to the people of Charleville but to the people of Buttevant.  As to Fermoy, I am certain that a scheme would be put up by the Urban Council and the County Council for improving the roads leading into the town which are very dangerous owing to very high walls enclosing them.  If the mountain land which I mentioned were bought out for afforestation purposes continuous and reproductive work could be given for a number of years.  I am delighted to think that such a sum of money has been made available, as in cases where we would be inclined to do certain work we will be able to ask for a subsidy.  For instance, if a town wants a water supply the cost of which would be prohibitive for the ratepayers, if a fifty-fifty grant were given it would be an encouragement to the local authority to start the work immediately. I hail with delight the fact <Col N="687" /> that we have £300,000 to help in such works and I would impress upon the Government the necessity for having these works started as soon as possible, as the people are expecting some help to tide them over the dark months of December, January and February. For that reason I think we should lose no time in speech-making but set to work at once and help the Government to make the best use of this grant.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this Vote has been introduced, as it is necessary owing to the present depression and the unfavourable weather conditions.  I want some of this money for West Cork, but I am afraid that Deputy Daly wants to get all of it for East Cork.  There are certain schemes which would be very useful along the sea-board in the area I represent. Along that sea-board there is a number of fishing-hamlets.  The people living in these hamlets might be called amphibious&mdash;they live partly on the land and partly on the water.  They derive very little at present from the water in the way of fish, but they till a good portion of the land they have and provide themselves with most of the necessaries of life.  They do not use artificial manure for their land but avail themselves of dredged sand and seaweed.  I, with other Deputies from West Cork have time and again put up to the Department concerned the necessity of building little quays or slips to enable those people to land the sand and seaweed.  I am satisfied that these slips would not cost very much and that they would be a great boon and advantage to these people, who have to go to a great deal of trouble and labour to land this dredged sand and seaweed.  I am prepared to put up schemes with regard to these slips to the Department concerned and I hope they will be favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another proposal I have to make which would be of great advantage to the ratepayers in my area.  In South and West Cork there are two main roads which are the main arteries of the area and which are in very bad condition.  I understand that the Department of Local Government or the Road Board would be prepared to put <Col N="688" /> up half the cost of putting those roads in good condition.</P>
    <P>One is the Cork-Kinsale road, mentioned by the Independent Republican Deputy last night, and the other the main road from Clonakilty to Rosscarbery and Skibbereen, and on to Mizen Head.  These are roads serving a very big area, and they are in an extremely bad condition.  The Road Board is prepared to put up half the cost of the Cork-Kinsale road.  The Co. Council are not in a position to pay the other half, but I think that if out of this grant something were given to meet the Co. Council portion of the way, it would be a very useful work.  It would be a great relief to the unemployed and a relief to the ratepayer, and certainly it would be the greatest benefit to the general community of that area.  I hope these two schemes that I suggest will be adopted.  I do not think that drainage and afforestation schemes come in.  You cannot do drainage at this season of the year.  I think these are too big to bring in under this grant.  Road improvement schemes will do a lot, and give a lot of relief to the ratepayers.  I throw out these suggestions for consideration.</P>

      <P>I regret the occasion has arisen again this year.  Ministers and their Departments, after five months' holidays, have nothing to offer the country as a cure for its distress except to feed the dog on a piece of its own tail.  What is the meaning of all those relief schemes?  It is rather amusing to find that Deputies on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches are prepared to share out the soup to the different portions of their constituencies. I support Deputy Daly's appeal on behalf of East Cork, and I regret the occasion has arisen.  I hope the Minister for Finance will pay particular attention to the need for giving £25,000 to the town of Midleton which he has stolen from it in converting the raw material of malting barley into the raw material of malt.  This year the sum of £131,000 has been transferred from the workers of the Free State to the workers of Northern Ireland and Britain by the Minister for Finance refusing to prevent the importation of foreign malt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, by no means; this is a different case altogether.  Two hundred families have been thrown out of employment in Midleton, which means a loss of £25,000 a year to the town.  We had the Minister for Local Government refusing to sanction housing schemes in Cork City, and elsewhere, because the houses were to be built of Youghal brick that would cost 30/- a house more than the houses built of foreign cement.  On account of that, we had a statement made at the Youghal Council that some 70 men were thrown out of employment in the Youghal brickworks.  If the Minister makes up the total of the wages of these 70 men for 12 months, and sends that sum down to Youghal he will be giving back only what was stolen from Midleton, and what was stolen from Youghal by one of his Departments.  Deputy Daly was very anxious about Fermoy. If the flour mills were kept going, and the flour production of Messrs.  Ranks' mills in England prevented from coming into this country there would be far less unemployment in Fermoy and there would be far less difficulties in turning the corner that the country has turned so often.  The same applies to the town of Mallow, where a lot of people were thrown out of employment because of the importation of foreign flour, which is responsible for the unemployment in the flour mills there. There would be no occasion for these relief grants if the Government made the slightest attempt to look after this country first, and other countries afterwards. But our Ministers are so busy with the affairs and grievances of Portugal, and in going over to London to dine with the Prince of Wales, that they have not time to look after the country that is paying them £1,700 a year each to look after it.  That is the position of affairs, and it is time to end it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no occasion for doling out soup&mdash;one cannot call it anything else &mdash;if a fair attempt was made by the Executive Council to provide employment <Col N="690" /> for the people.  These attempts are not being made.  I do not know what financial ties the Executive Council have bound themselves up in with certain manufacturers in this country and other countries which prevent them interfering to protect our Irish industries.  But that is the cause of the whole trouble.  The Minister for Finance will also want to pay particular attention in giving out this money to the tillage areas in East Cork which he has refused to protect. From these tillage areas he was appealed to three years ago to have the land revalued on account of its being valued as wheat land and the rates being out of proportion to the value of the land.  He said it was too much trouble and expense to have the land revalued.  These poor people are in the soup ever since, and it is time he did something for them.  There is unemployment in these tillage areas owing to the large amount of land that has gone out of tillage owing to the absolute neglect of the Minister and his Department to protect these areas.  It is time the Executive Government took some steps at least to see that there should not be this recurring sore in this country.</P>
    <P>In 1920 and 1921 we had a statement made by Lord French that there were 100,000 too many young men in the country.  Evidently the Executive Council are falling in with the policy that Lord French then enunciated, to get rid of these 100,000 young men. Then you will have a quiet country.  Nothing will be left then but the old men and the cripples.  Evidently that is the policy of the Executive Council.  We are sick of coming here year after year listening to the £300,000 dole story to-day, some other dole to-morrow and the country as bad as ever afterwards. Where is this £300,000 to come from? It is dragged out of the pockets of the unfortunate ratepayers.  It is as I say a case of feeding the dog with a piece of his own tail.  I pointed out to the Minister for Finance the different towns in my constituency that have been bled white from his action in the last few years.  These towns have a special claim on gentlemen opposite who robbed them.  In one of these towns 200 people have been thrown out <Col N="691" /> of employment in the process of changing one raw material into another raw material.  It is time these things were attended to and the policy of the Departments and the Ministers is a policy of importing foreign stuff and allowing people to walk the streets idle and then voting £300,000 about Christmas in order to enable Deputies opposite to give doles to the different Cumann na nGaedheal clubs in preparation for the General Election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the Vote of £300,000, which the Minister has introduced for this purpose, as only a small contribution to the problem which confronts the country at the present time.  I agree with Deputies who say that we should not unduly exaggerate the situation which we know exists in the country to-day.  I disagree entirely, however, with the Ministers coming to this House, both on this and in previous years, and producing figures which they must know do not represent the actual situation in the country.  I refer particularly to the figures that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have produced regarding the extent and number of people supposed to be unemployed at the present moment.  What is known as the live register does not, as every Deputy must know, represent the actual number of unemployed in the country at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to state whether he has any information to show the extent to which the St. Vincent de Paul Society has been engaged at relief work in the City of Dublin during the past year.  I understand from the report for the past year that the members of the Society, who do voluntary work in regard to visiting people who are destitute, visited 30,000 families in the city, whereas the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government tried to induce Deputies to believe that there are only 20,000 people actually unemployed in the whole of the Free State. The Minister for Local Government yesterday quoted figures showing the extent to which his Department and <Col N="692" /> other Government Departments are assisting by providing money from local loans, and said that local loans were available to the extent of £1,000,000. I venture to suggest that that sum of £1,000,000 is not likely to be expended before the end of the financial year, and probably, in some cases, not before the end of the financial year, which will end on 31st March, 1932.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister for Local Government, or in fact any other Minister, producing figures for the information of Deputies who know very well that such figures do not represent to any extent the measure of financial support which is being provided for the relief of unemployment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted a figure of 20,000 as representing the number of people on the live register of unemployed.  I have information to show that since 1925 railway men to the number of 4,500 have been dismissed owing to the Government's policy of amalgamation plus the Government's policy of subsidising road transport is against the railway industry.  I can truthfully say that out of the 4,500 railway men who were dismissed a very small percentage, not more than one-third at most, would be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefit.  Why?  Because the 4,500 dismissed men, together with those who remain in the service, were relieved from the liability of paying unemployment insurance contributions simply because railway employees, previous to amalgamation, were supposed to have permanent employment.</P>
    <P>About two-thirds of those who were dismissed, as a result of the Government's policy of amalgamation and also the policy of subsidising road transport as against, the railway industry, are not in a position to claim or to receive unemployment insurance benefit. Therefore two-thirds of the men who have been dismissed are not added to the live register which the Minister contends represents the number of those who are at present unemployed. In addition to that, those of us who represent rural areas know that there has been a considerable addition to the ranks of the unemployed as a result of the decrease in the amount of land under tillage.  According to the information <Col N="693" /> given by the Department of Agriculture, there has been a decrease in the area of land under tillage between 1921 and 1930 of 365,000 acres. I contend that an acre of land under tillage should be valued from the point of view of the State, at, at least, £10. Assuming for the purpose of argument that £4 out of the £10 represents wages paid to workers in tilling the land, it would mean a loss in wages to the agricultural labourers of £1,500,000. Assuming that agricultural workers are receiving a minimum wage of 25s. per week, it means a loss of employment to between 23,000 and 24,000 men.  These figures do not appear on the live register simply because agricultural workers are not ordinarily engaged in an insurable occupation.</P>
    <P>I refer to these matters in order to make it clear, as it must be clear, to every intelligent Deputy that what is referred to as the live register does not represent the extent of unemployment at present.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he can furnish the Dáil with information regarding the increase in the number of people employed by firms who got loans guaranteed by the Government. I have information in regard to one or two cases which would prove that since the loans were guaranteed by the Government the number of men employed in the industries concerned has been reduced.  I can give the names of the firms involved, if necessary.  I know that about twenty firms have been given guaranteed loans.  I would like to know the extent to which these loans have helped to increase the number of people engaged in the industries concerned.  I think that Deputies are entitled to be shown the amount of assistance that has been given to industry through those loans, and to what extent the number of people employed in the industries concerned has been increased.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, one must pay some regard to the amount of money paid by way of home assistance in the various counties.  Speaking from knowledge which I have regarding the amount of money paid out by way of home help in one county of my constituency, I may say that the figures <Col N="694" /> are:&mdash;In the year 1926-7, £8,527; 1927-8, £8,791; 1928-9, £10,477; 1029-30, £10,804.  I am sure that the Minister for Local Government, in view of the information which he has at his disposal and which is supplied to him by the auditors who audit the accounts of the boards of health to which I am now referring, will certify that there is no money paid in this particular area to any individual unless he is entitled to it under the existing law. Therefore the figures which I am quoting, in addition to the other facts, go to show that the situation in the area which I represent is much more serious than it was a year or two or three years ago.  We are often asked by members of the Government, and by Deputies who support them, what suggestions we have to make for the purpose of relieving unemployment.  On many occasions during previous discussions and debates of a similar kind to this I endeavoured to impress on the Ministry, and on the Minister for Finance in particular, the necessity of providing out of Votes of this kind money to carry out sewerage and water works schemes where such schemes are urgently required.</P>
    <P>I have in mind three or four towns where such schemes are urgently required in the opinion of the medical officers of health, and in one county in the opinion of the county medical officer of health.  In one town where such a scheme has been prepared the charge on the ratepayers in the dispensary area concerned for a water supply would amount to 2s. 6d. in the £, and, in the case of another town, to 1s. 8d. in the £.  The schemes to which I am referring have already been submitted to the Ministry of Local Government, and I want the Minister for Finance to say whether he agrees that local ratepayers should be charged with a liability to that extent for carrying out such schemes.  In the first place, I am sure he will agree that they are urgently required.  In cases where the medical officers of health and county medical officers of health agree that schemes are necessary they should be carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am not prepared to agree, especially under present <Col N="695" /> circumstances, that local ratepayers should be charged with the liability, for the purpose of carrying out such schemes, to the amount of 2s. 6d. and 1s. 8d. in the £.  If, therefore, the schemes are to be carried out, I think that the liability of the local ratepayer should be reduced at any rate to a figure approximating to 6d. in the £.  If that is to be done, the only way in which it can be done is by giving contributions from this relief scheme Vote which the Minister has introduced. I can tell the Minister quite frankly that these schemes will not be put into operation unless relief comes from sources other than the ratepayers in the towns concerned.  In the case of another town where the public health conditions are of the worst possible kind, I have been furnished with information to the effect that there are 97 able-bodied individuals, most of them married and with dependents, out of work.  Can the Minister tell me what kind of scheme, other than the public health schemes to which I have referred, will give more valuable or more reproductive employment in such a place?</P>
    <P>At any rate the schemes to which I refer have been put forward by the people concerned, passed by the boards of health, and sanctioned by the Department of Local Government, but they will not be carried out under present circumstances unless a grant from some source is made available by the Minister.  I am sorry to say that in one other important town in my area the sanitary conditions are in a very bad state.  In that area there is a considerable number of men employed in a local industry, and although reports have been made to the medical officer of health, he has not, so far as I know, taken any effective steps to see that the conditions are remedied.  In all these areas&mdash;I am sure that every Deputy can say the same in regard to his own area&mdash;these schemes cannot be carried out at the expense of the local ratepayers.  I desire to emphasise anything I have previously stated during similar debates with a view to trying to convince the Minister to give some assistance in carrying out these public health works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> There is another matter which I think affects a good many areas, especially in view of the very bad harvest and the wet period through which we have recently passed.  There are hundreds of people in my constituency who are unable to get turf or fuel of any kind owing to the wet season.  I would recommend the Minister to allocate some money out of this Vote to improving roads leading to bogs where the turf is lying, as otherwise it cannot be got out.  There is just one matter to which I have referred on previous occasions.  I protest and strongly object at this particular period against giving the work, which may be available as a result of a Vote of this kind, almost altogether to men who were in the National Army.  The money which is being set aside as a result of this Vote is not being collected solely from the supporters of Cumann na nGaedheal. Therefore I think that every taxpayer who will be called on to find this money is entitled to an assurance&mdash;in fact, to a guarantee&mdash;that individuals will be given fair consideration on their merits for any work that may be going.</P>
    <P>I understand that the system which has been in existence for six or seven years is that ex-National Army men must get preference.  I contend that preference for employment on public works of this kind under present circumstances should be given to individuals on the basis of their merits for such work, plus their dependency; in other words, their qualifications should be on the basis of their individual suitability and the number of their dependents.  I cannot understand why a single ex-National Army man should get preference to a married man with dependents.  I think that the time has come when that preference should be abolished, and when able-bodied citizens should be entitled to that work on their qualifications, plus the number of their dependents. I hope that the Minister will remove that preferential barrier which was set up many years ago, and which he promised to remove some time ago.  I hope, at any rate, that he will make certain that the money provided under this Vote will be made available for <Col N="697" /> every citizen on the grounds of his suitability for the class of work to be done, and on the number of dependents for whom he has to provide.</P>

      <P>(Cork): At this late hour of the night I have no intention to inflict a written speech on members of the Dáil.  I rise to say that I am extremely grateful to the President and the Executive Council for this grant of £300,000 which, I believe, will be honestly administered.  I believe that every constituency in the Twentysix Counties will get its fair share of it for the relief of unemployment. Personally, in regard to the constituency that I have the honour to be one of its representatives, I was glad to hear my colleague, Deputy Murphy, on the Labour Benches, bear testimony to the fact that for years he has always been supported in his appeals on behalf of the workers down there by the Government, and that such appeals were favourably received.  It is very pleasant to hear a Labour Deputy acknowledge that the Government has done something, but I was astonished and pained to hear Deputies Hogan, Cassidy, and Clery talking about starvation in the Saorstát.  God forbid that there should be any starvation. It is not because we had a little visitation of Providence in the last two or three months that we should despair.  God is good.  He never deserted this grand old nation, and He will bring sunshine and prosperity back to the land again.  I never heard during this debate one word of thankfulness expressed to the Almighty for His favours to this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on Deputies to remember the state of the world at present.  There are nations experiencing earthquakes and floods at the present time, and destruction is going on in many countries. What else can we say about this dear land of ours than that the Almighty God is looking after it?  Do not let the cry go out that we are a starving nation.  We are not Deputy Hogan and Deputy Cassidy should be ashamed to say that there is starvation in Clare or in Donegal.  Have they not the machinery of local government at their hands?  Have they not medical officers, clergy, relieving officers and <Col N="698" /> boards of health?  If Deputy Hogan, Deputy Cassidy and Deputy Clery do not make them do their duty to the poor and destitute they have no right to be here as the representatives of those constituencies in the Dáil.  I over and over again, heard in this House our able and active Minister for Local Government proclaim that in case of necessity, where there was any danger of starvation in any portion of the Saorstát, that the relieving officers and the doctors were to act on their own responsibility, that no one was to suffer from want of food or nourishment, nor need they wait for directions from their boards of health to provide that food and nourishment.  He pointed out that under the law of this State the relieving officers and the doctors were entitled to go to the rescue of the poor and the afflicted.  I say to the Deputies opposite and to Deputies on the Labour Benches that they ought to remember we have a grand old country.  If there is a little depression at the present time, please God, as I have said, the future is looking well.  Deputies opposite did not confine themselves to a criticism of this Vote.  They criticised the actions and work of the Government since it came into office eight years ago.  I am a member of the House for the last three years, and I can honestly say from my heart that progress has been made year after year and that we have now turned the corner.  Since I became a member here hundreds and thousands of houses have been built in and around Dublin.  Work has been provided, too, in the city of Cork.  There is depression in the counties, but that will be removed, and, with the blessing of God, our country will again be prosperous. Therefore, I say, there is no need in this House for the wail of despair that we have had to listen to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>After the flight of oratory to which we have just listened I feel that I do not want to take up much of the time of the House, but I would remind Deputy Sheehy, for whom I have very great respect indeed, that the same kind of speech was made in the very portion of the county which he represents at a time when a family died of starvation in the  <Col N="699" /> Adrigole.  That occurred within the last couple of years.  It is only twelve months ago, since some other families in that particular area were almost at the point of death, due to starvation, and were rescued in time.  I said here before that I am not one of those who believe in saying that we are down and out.  I, like Deputy Sheehy, think that we are resourceful enough and have grit enough to get out of all our difficulties.  While I welcome this Vote of £300,000, I cannot help suggesting that it is rather unfortunate that our native Government has been unable to find any other solution than a Vote of this kind to deal with the unemployment and poverty that undoubtedly exist to a degree in our country.  The schemes for which it makes provision are only of a tentative character. They are merely, I suggest, a form of dope for a diseased economic system. I want to say that, in my view, it is almost criminal for any Deputy or Party to attempt to make political or party capital out of the misfortunes of our people.</P>

    <P>In saying what I have said I want to dissociate myself from the remarks of some Deputies who to-night made cheap sneers at members of the Government for attending conferences at Geneva, London and elsewhere.  I visualise the time when possibly Fianna Fáil may be in power, and it would be only quite natural that perhaps Deputy de Valera, accompanied by some of his Ministers and possibly by Deputy Clery, would have to visit some of these countries if they are to maintain the dignity of what both Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil claim to be a sovereign State.  I do not think any useful purpose is served by cheap sneers of that kind. In my view, these cheap sneers are not even good propaganda.  Undoubtedly, propaganda of that kind does appeal to the very worst elements in this country. I should say that it appeals to the worst elements in any country.  You have a section of the community here, as you have in other countries, which is always only too willing to drink in and absorb that class of propaganda.  In my view, it is a dangerous policy to pursue and has a boomerang-like effect <Col N="700" /> on those who use it and on the Party which attempts to make it an instrument to climb into power or office over the backs of other people.</P>
    <P>The President in announcing this grant of £300,000 suggested that a considerable portion of the sum would be utilised in providing employment in rural areas.  The conditions in the counties and rural areas have been voiced by a number of representatives, but I would like to remind the Minister that there are also a couple of cities in the Free State.  The Minister has clearly indicated that, while most of this grant will be spent in work useful or otherwise in the rural areas, he also gave a further indication that at least some of it will be spent in the towns and cities.  The Minister must have in mind that cities, such as Cork, embrace a very large proportion of the rural community.  For that reason, amongst others, I welcome this grant, though I do not care, as I have already indicated, for grants of this kind because they are only of a tentative or temporary nature and do not touch the fringe of the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest one or two ways in which this money could be very usefully spent.  I know that the Minister has commonsense enough not to indulge in any uneconomic expenditure, but he may be unaware that in the City of Cork, for instance, a decent attempt is about to be made in the direction of slum clearances and of erecting, in place of this slum property, a number of decent houses for working-class people.  The preparations to be made for the clearance of that slum property might very well be begun before the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that Cork is particularly well off because of the Ford industry, but I want to tell you what may appear to be paradoxical, that at the peak point of the Ford industry, when some 7,000 persons were employed, there was never so much employment in Cork and never so many persons unemployed.  That may be a paradox but it is true.  I will explain the reason.  Because of the activities of the Ford industry many thousands of persons were attracted to the city, but that great industry could not <Col N="701" /> absorb all the unemployed persons. Thousands of persons outside the normal number who might have been unemployed came from other centres&mdash; and I am not saying that in a spirit of parochialism&mdash;so that whilst we had more employment than ever before, there was still a larger number than ever unemployed in the second city&mdash; or should I say the first city&mdash;in the Free State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly mentioned the peculiar circumstances that exist in Fermoy. I want to say that what was said about Fermoy is applicable to nearly every other town or village in which garrisons were maintained in the past. In one small village outside the City of Cork, where, at the time of the British occupation, thousands of cavalry and artillery soldiers were stationed, much distress and actual poverty, on the border-line of starvation, exists at present.  Nothing has taken the place of the British military.  The consequence is that that little village, like many more of the same category throughout the Free State, has been reduced to a very bad state.  You have there, as possibly in other old garrison towns, a number of houses known as the married quarters which, with very little outlay, might be converted into decent working-class houses.  In nearly all cases the walls are standing, and some of the roofs are all right, so that in all cases you have the nucleus of decent houses.</P>
    <P>I could indicate other ways in which the money could be spent.  I think it is one of our peculiarities to point out how money could be spent, while people rarely make a suggestion as to how it is to be raised.  Other Deputies have indicated how the money could be usefully and economically spent, so that I do not want to traverse that ground.  I want to say, however, that Cork Corporation will naturally apply for a share of the grant.  When the Minister is replying, I would be glad if he would let the House know how he proposes to allocate the money.  Is it on a population basis or will the sum allotted have any relation to the numbers unemployed? Above all, I would stress the point that has been stressed by my colleague, Deputy Davin, that whilst I <Col N="702" /> have very great regard for any man who has served his country, whether it be as a soldier, sailor or policeman, I have, at least, the same regard for the citizen who is a good citizen.  I hope no undue discrimination will be exercised either by the Minister or by those who will administer this fund in the giving of employment.  It is very unfair because a man has given service in the National Army, perhaps a single man, without any dependents, that he should get preference over a civilian who has a wife and several children.  That is causing a good deal of trouble, and I think the Minister and the Government would be well advised to drop the policy of discriminating as between one man and another. If I were a member of the Government, I would not discriminate between any man, no matter whether he was an ex-I.R.A. man, an ex-National Army man, or an ex-British soldier, because I believe that one man is just as good as another.  Many of the men who joined the British Army did not do so through any love of the British uniform, but in 99 per cent. of the cases it was purely an economic necessity.</P>
    <P>When he is replying I would ask the Minister to let the House know how he proposes to allocate the money, whether on a population basis or having regard to the number of persons unemployed.  I would again remind him that the returns of the Labour Exchange are not accurate returns.  They are not even an indication of the number of persons unemployed, because he must know that the live register only represents the number of persons who are entitled to draw unemployment benefit and that once a man ceases to draw that benefit he has no longer any use for registering.  Hence, you will find on close analysis of the position that the number of persons not signing and unemployed are about twice the number signing and drawing benefits.</P>

      <P>Anything that concerns criticism of the grand old Dame Britannia he resents.  We know that he has a very deep regard for that great old Empire, and the institutions connected with it.  One has not to read very much Irish history to be reminded during the course of this debate of that period when we had the soupers dishing out soup.  I think some Deputy referred to the matter to-day in another sense.  Is there anything more degrading to honest and sincere Irishmen than to have to listen to the tone of the speeches delivered on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, and unfortunately the speech delivered by the last Deputy on the Labour Benches?  Does it not bring us back to the period when the soup was being dished out, and when certain conditions had to be complied with?</P>
      <P>The conditions this time are, first of all, loyalty to the party in office.  Those who cannot give faith and guarantees to that loyalty are very nervous lest their particular constituency may be left out of consideration when this grant is being distributed.  For the past few years since I came into this House I have, on various occasions, endeavoured to get the Ministers, from the President down to the Minister for Local Government, to face this question of unemployment from a human standpoint, to recognise it as a human problem, and each time they have either gone to sleep on the benches or indulged in sneers and laughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> I want to make a further attempt even at the risk of repetition. I want to ask the Minister for Finance if he is prepared to face this problem as a human problem, and if, taking it on that principle, he is prepared to admit that he and his Cabinet colleagues have any moral responsibility in connection with this matter of the unemployed and how they have faced up to that moral responsibility.  What is the position in rural Ireland to-day?  The Minister for Finance some years ago, perhaps he is up to the present time, was a frequent visitor to certain parts of the West-of Ireland at any rate, and he knows, and most of the Deputies in this House know, that in many parishes and townlands in the South and West of Ireland there are small farmers struggling with farms of from three to ten acres from daylight to dark to eke out a miserable existence, trying to feed themselves, their wives and children.  They have not displayed any failings in the matter of industry.  They are hard-working, honest and zealous, giving the best that is in them in order to do what they believe to be their duty to their wives and children, and yet, despite their almost superhuman efforts, they have failed year after year.  I am leaving out of account any effort on their part to educate their children, but from the point of view of clothing and feeding their children, when they fail what is the attitude of the State towards them?  To treat them as paupers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give specific instances of small farmers from the Co. Leitrim who represent this particular type and I know from conversations with Deputies of all parties in this House that this is not confined to Co. Leitrim, Galway and Clare.  I am personally conversant with the conditions in these areas.  Is it fair when these efforts on the part of these small farmers to succeed in feeding and clothing their children fail through no fault of their own that any Government Minister can come to this House and tell the elected representatives of those people that there is no starvation, there is no position requiring heroic remedies, but nevertheless we are prepared to grant £300,000 by way of relief for relief schemes?  Should the Government not realise that they are the managing directors of a business concern?  We have been elected here to represent the people's interests and to make known their grievances, and why should we be treated with these sneers and be told there is no starvation and that we should be satisfied with this £300,000?  Who owns the money the Government are so generous about? &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said some Deputy, &ldquo;that we have a Minister here who is prepared to give us so generous treatment for our starving people.&rdquo; Whose money are they giving out and what are they doing with all the other hundreds of thousands of pounds?  Have they a mandate from the people of this country to go banqueting and lavishing in luxury both here and in London spending the people's money?  That is the criticism which Deputy Anthony resents and that is what I feel comes very badly from a representative of Irish Labour.  Deputy Clery resented and criticised the attitude of the Ministry in coming to this House propagating a spirit of pauperism in the country, coming back after five months, this House being closed in the meantime, with a statement of the flourishing <Col N="706" /> condition in which this country stood, our high position in the world's credit market, and so on, yet closing their eyes to the fact that there is a real state of economic starvation existing throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clery stated that during the time when other Ministers were all away, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was gadding around Europe, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Lands and Fisheries went down to Kerry, and in one day they received thirty-seven deputations.  What were those deputations being received for?  What representations did those deputations make to those Ministers?  I submit out of those thirty-seven deputations, if the truth were known, many of them were begging, but few of them had the courage to come in and demand their common rights as citizens, because they knew if they went in to demand them the reception they would get.  I am not going to follow on the lines of other Deputies who have quoted statistics and shown time after time in these debates how relief schemes could be brought into force, how unemployment could be relieved in one district and another by this, that and the other method.  That is all very good in itself, but, to my mind, there should be no need for it, or to convince Ministers that there are ways and means of solving this unemployment problem. Is it really to be taken seriously that there are no ways and means of solving this problem?  The attitude of the Ministry, then, is to have a sufficient number of people starving in order to keep another section of our people appealing on behalf of that starving section, and the starving section applauding those who get them sops and doles, making political capital out of their misery and hunger.  This is the attitude of Cumann na nGaedheal. Their henchmen on the back benches should be ashamed to call themselves Irishmen, making political capital out of hunger and misery.  It is by a mere accident of birth that a man is born on a three-acre farm or a 200-acre farm or is born in a city mansion or a slum. Yet these people have been placed here and have refused to recognise their moral responsibilities.  When we come <Col N="707" /> in, year after year, when unemployment is given any space on our Order Papers for discussion, it is treated, as the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; to-day would have us believe, as a political catchcry. They point out, of course, that the Deputies who criticise the Government's policy of unemployment invariably fail to point out any remedy. That is the cry of the daily Press. That is the attitude of the Minister. They get up and tell us that there is £300,000.  Their loyal henchmen behind them clap them on the backs and applaud their generosity.  Other Deputies are expected to get up here and show why that grant is inadequate, why it should be extended, and how it could be extended.  That is not our function.  I, for one, refuse to accept that rôle.  I say, with all sincerity, that I would not remain 24 hours a member of a Government Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That does not matter. I am a member of this House at the moment.  If I were convinced that that Government Party failed to realise their moral responsibility, if the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance or any Minister will say that they recognise their moral responsibility, that they have explored every avenue that the present social order allows them to explore and that within those avenues they are unable to find a solution, then we will know where we are.  Will they go a little further?  Will they say having explored those avenues and failed to find a solution for unemployment that their moral responsibility ends there?  Within this State there is sufficient natural wealth to maintain twice our present population.  Therefore, their moral responsibility does not end there.  Will they go a little further then and say: &ldquo;We are prepared now to throw ourselves on the mercy of this House and to ask you all to outline ways and means by which we can change that economic system sufficiently to enable us to maintain our present population in a reasonable standard of comfort&rdquo;?  That is all I ask.  Call that communism if you like. It is my conception of a Christian duty <Col N="708" /> and no responsible Government, Minister, Deputy or any other responsible public man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, the old spirit of the landlord system in this country is still loyally adhered to and loyally propagated.  Therefore, we must keep one section of our people starving, we must keep them in ignorance.  Well did the old Irish landlord realise the truth of the maxim: &ldquo;Train, drill and educate.  Man is master of his fate.&rdquo; If the Irish peasant farmers were educated to realise the value they are to this State surely they would demand in return a mere subsistence, surely they would demand that their children should not be allowed to go hungry and barefooted, as they are, through the hills and waysides of the country? Most of the Deputies who have spoken have confined themselves to dealing with conditions in their own particular areas.  Most of the Deputies on the Government Benches have appealed to the Ministers to see that their areas are not left out of consideration, again indicating the slave mentality.  If my constituency is well treated I will get credit for that and it will increase the number of votes which I will secure at the next election! I think it is very unfair to treat that problem in such a manner.  That is why I make particular reference to rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, one cannot ignore the conditions obtaining in Dublin City.  One cannot think of unemployment or know anything about it who does not know the conditions which obtain in the City of Dublin&mdash;this City of Dublin, the capital of Ireland, the Ireland which Deputy Sheehy, President Cosgrave and others tell us is in such a glowing condition of prosperity but whose housing conditions are stated to be the worst in any State in Europe.  These are facts that have been repeated many times in this House, but we must keep on repeating them.  The housing conditions are worse in Dublin than in any city in Europe.  Seventy-nine thousand people live in one-roomed tenements, many of them with five, seven, eight or ten of a family living in one room.  Let Deputy Davis and <Col N="709" /> those other comfortable, well-fed and wealthy Deputies think of that.  Think for one moment how they would feel if by a revolution of power they were to be suddenly thrown into conditions such as these.  Yet, these are human beings, brothers and sisters we are told, of ours and they are herded there under conditions which some of you would not keep your cattle in.</P>
    <P>It is over two years since we had a by-election in North City Dublin. The Government candidate there&mdash; Deputy Rice&mdash;is a prominent member of the Government Party.  Deputy Rice practically promised that if he were elected to this House unemployment would be unknown within twelve months.  I think that would about summarise all the promises that Deputy Rice made.  They amounted in effect to that, that unemployment would end.  He would see to it.  He was Chairman of the Special Committee which was set up to examine the problem and they would find ways and means of getting a solution.</P>
    <P>Two-and-a-half years have passed since then and the conditions instead of improving are very much worse. Everyone knows that.  I have not got the figures.  I do not see the use of collecting statistics in the matter.  I presume the Ministers have them at their fingers' ends.  They have their experts.  No matter what figures Deputies on this side of the House bring forward, if the Ministers desire it they can get their experts to contradict these figures.  They can make any case they wish out of figures.  Deputy Davin pointed out that the Saint Vincent de Paul Society had visited 30,000 persons in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>How many of these did the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or Deputy Rice visit; or how many efforts did either the Minister or Deputy Rice make to secure employment for these 30,000 people?  I think it would be much better and much more manly and a more Irish attitude on their part if the Ministers would concentrate upon this problem of unemployment, instead of going across to London whenever they are called there and doing there what their masters tell them, in order to win <Col N="710" /> the smiles and encouragement of their masters.  They must be tied to some sinister machine, either in London or elsewhere, and that sinister machine, of course, is finance.  The big power of finance has got this Cabinet in its grip. After all, time will break that machine. These great geniuses who have, we are told, served this State so well during the last eight years must realise that their term of office is drawing to a close.  Indeed, that is agreed on by every section in the House.  At the eleventh hour I would appeal to them to do the manly thing, to break with that power, and come to the people who elected them to this House, and say: &ldquo;Yes, we are prepared to recognise you as our masters.&rdquo;  They will then take up this question of unemployment and see that the conditions which have existed will continue no longer throughout this country.  The Ministers tell us that giving a relief of a mere £300,000 is going to be a solution of the difficulty.  I would like that the Ministers would have the courage to go down to the country and make there the statements which they have made in this House.  My attitude towards the question of unemployment is this&mdash;I deplore having to listen to people standing up here and applauding the Minister for his generosity.  I deplore, as well, other Deputies for appealing for an extension of that generosity.  My attitude is just the same as that of John Mitchel towards England at the time when the Constitutional leaders of that period were talking about concessions.  He said: &ldquo;Damn your concessions, we want our country.&rdquo;  I say on behalf of the unemployed and on behalf of the peasant farmers of Ireland and on behalf of the town workers of Ireland: &ldquo;Damn your concessions, we want our rights.  We want the right to work.&rdquo;  I demand on behalf of those people that the Ministers who are elected here as a Government of this State should get down to this problem of unemployment, examine the resources of the State and come to this House and say: &ldquo;The assets are so-and-so, and the liabilities are so-and-so, and we demand that they shall utilise these resources in order to put an end to hunger, first of <Col N="711" /> all.&rdquo;  Hunger should not be allowed to exist; it does exist, but it is time that that condition of things was ended.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate and I would not do so except for the unfortunate intrusion of the last speaker.  I think it is due to the House that Deputies should, at least while in the House, comport themselves with dignity. Amongst the Deputies of the Opposition Party I do not know a single Deputy except the last speaker who would make himself responsible for the impertinence and insolence we have listened to.  It is characteristic of that back bencher.  The back benchers on the Opposition side of the House differ from me on many things, but at least they have always been gentlemen who have expressed themselves in terms to which nobody could take exception. For pure insolent ignorance&mdash;I have a difficulty in choosing proper language to express my views of the speaker who has just sat down&mdash;I have never heard anything in this House to equal in any way the language we have listened to just now.  That is the kind of language that would scarcely do credit to a thirty-second-rate street corner orator.  I will not dwell upon the merits of the case that has been discussed here.  I know very well that distress exists in the country, for I myself come from a district in which it exists and so does a respected colleague of the last speaker.  He will bear me out in this&mdash;that knowing the conditions that exist we would never dream of putting up the insolently ignorant whine to which we have listened.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the <Col N="712" /> largely increased imports of foreign malt during the nine months January to September, 1930, with resulting unemployment and distress, he will consider prohibiting the importation of foreign malt into the Saorstát.  His reply to me was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under existing law the Government have no-powers to prohibit the importation of foreign malt into the Saorstát, and it is not intended to approach the Oireachtas for the grant of such powers in view of the fact that malt is the raw material for the important industry of brewing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now it is rather an amazing statement for the Minister to make here that malt is a raw material.  When we consider the fact that the difference between the price of foreign barley imported into this country at a price of 7s. 1d. per cwt., and foreign malt being brought in at 15s. 4d. per cwt., we see at once that the difference amounts to 8s. 3d. a cwt.  The loss to Irish maltsters, the men working in malt houses is a very large one.  This money goes to men working in English malt houses and to men working in malt houses in the North of Ireland.  If any sane reason can be put forward for the importation into this country of barley there cannot be any justification whatever and no sane reason for the importation into the country of malt, thus depriving the Irish workers of a sum which I estimate at £131,000&mdash;that is a difference between the price of foreign barley and foreign malt.  This is a case in which a large amount of unemployment and distress is involved and I can see no justification for the action of the Government in permitting these imports. Whatever justification there may be for the importation of barley into the country there can be none whatever for the importation of this malt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past two days we have been considering, and we will consider again to-morrow, a relief grant of £300,000. Here we have in one item a sum of £131,000 filched from the pockets of Irish workers.  The Minister announced to-day that the Executive Council did not intend putting the question of malting barley before the Tariff Commission <Col N="713" /> because malting barley was the raw material of malt; foreign malt is evidently another raw material of whiskey.  From what I can see happening here within the past few months the Minister is not the raw material but the finished product of Imperialism.  To-day the Minister for Finance had the extreme courtesy to announce that he was not going to reply to me; evidently he has no reply to make and he thought his absence would be the best method of sparing him the trouble of fabricating some answer.  I do not know what ties certain brewers in this country have with Deputies on the Government Benches. The Executive Council is not elected to look after the interests of one particular brewery here, but it would seem that they are concerned when the interests of that firm come right up against the interests of a large number of unfortunate people who are thrown out of employment through this importation of malt.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear some justification given for the importation of malt. If the Executive Council are going to stand self-convicted of allowing £131,000 to be taken out of the pockets of Irish workers, let them be bold and brazen enough to say: &ldquo;Our financial interests in Messrs.  Guinness are so great that we cannot afford to quarrel with them, though we are depriving the workers of £131,000.&rdquo;  We have heard different plausible reasons given from time to time for the refusal to prevent the importation of various products.  I am sure the most extraordinary reason was that given by the Minister for Finance to-day when he solemnly announced that malt was a raw product, although it costs £131,000 in workmen's wages to convert malting barley into malt.  If we are given such excuses as that, all we can say to Ministers is that we wish them Godspeed in their absence from this House, and we hope that absence will soon be permanent.</P>

      <P>I did not know that malting barley was coming into this country at 7/1 per cwt.; I think it is coming in at something like 10/- or 11/- per cwt.  The barley coming in is mainly <Col N="714" /> malting barley, and it stands at about 22/- or 24/- a barrel.  On the Deputy's own figures the loss which he describes as a loss to the country would be something like £40,000 instead of £131,000, but that is only a detail.  Malt is a raw material, of course.  The Deputy said he thought it was the function of the Executive Council to consider the interests of the country as a whole, and to do the best thing by the country as a whole.  Whatever the functions of the Executive Council are, they certainly are not to run a business such as a brewery.</P>
      <P>I do not know why Guinness's brewery should be dragged in.  By the way, I am not defending Guinness's at all, because they do not need any defence.  Guinness's do not need any defence, and they would not even be thankful if they were defended.  I think it is humiliating to have members of the House constantly attacking Guinness's.  I do not mind Deputy Corry, but there are other members of the House, whom I will not now specify, constantly attacking what is generally admitted to be one of the most efficient institutions and business concerns in the world.  What is humiliating about it is that that concern would not think it worth its while to answer us.  I have enough respect for this country and for its Parliament to be humiliated every time I hear Deputies who are, after all, elected by an Irish constituency, in a futile, foolish sort of way attacking a concern that is admittedly one of the most efficient business concerns in the world.  That firm would not think it worth its while to waste two minutes in giving us any explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, it is considered necessary by this particular concern to import a certain amount of malt.  They have their own good reasons, and Deputy Corry may take it from me that you do not succeed in business except by the very closest attention to detail. I do not know anything about brewing, but I know enough about business methods generally to realise that a business concern cannot be made a success or kept successful under all sorts of conditions, in times of prosperity and in entirely different times&mdash;times of adversity&mdash;unless the closest attention <Col N="715" /> is given to matters of detail and unless the greatest possible foresight is exercised.  I know such attention cannot be given and such foresight cannot be exercised by any firm that takes into consideration anything beyond purely business considerations. Without knowing anything about brewing, but knowing something about the methods of first-class business, I will take it for granted, unless I am shown the contrary, that the considerations which induced Messrs.  Guinness to bring in malt are purely business considerations. I think we must stop at that.  If any industry wants further light on these reasons, the thing to do is to ask the Tariff Commission to consider the question of a tariff on imported malt.  Personally, I would be <Col N="716" /> absolutely against such a tariff for the reasons I have given.  But whether that is so or not, it is open to anybody to ask the Tariff Commission to examine the question and if they did examine it and came seriously to the question of prohibiting either imported barley used as raw material for this industry or the whiskey industry or imported malt for the same purpose, then I am perfectly certain that when wedid come down to an actual decision that you would not get any responsible members of any Party in the House to say that they and not the directors of the particular firms concerned should be the judges of what should be used as the raw materials of their industry.</P>
