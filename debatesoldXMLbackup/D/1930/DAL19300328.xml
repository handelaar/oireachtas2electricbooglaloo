      <P>Last evening the Dáil passed the Second Reading of a Bill entitled the Old Age Pensions Bill, 1929, by a majority of two.  In the course of the debate the Government, through the Minister for Finance, indicated their opposition to that measure, which proposed to impose a burden of some £300,000 per annum on the taxpayer. The cost of old age pensions to the State is already two and three-quarter million pounds per annum, and the Government, having given the matter the most careful consideration, are not prepared to take the responsibility in the present financial situation of providing a further large addition to that sum, which, while imposing a heavy burden on agriculture, trade and industry, would not even have the merit of benefiting the more necessitous and deserving old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Executive Council, while it appreciates that the result of yesterday's vote was due to the fortuitous circumstance that a number of the members of the Government Party were unavoidably absent, nevertheless feels that the House, having come to the decision that it did, should be given an opportunity of electing another Executive.  I have therefore tendered my resignation to His Excellency the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> I move, sir, that the House now adjourn until Wednesday next at 3 p.m., when I presume the first business will be the election of my successor.</P>

      <P>We are glad that the President has taken the decision that he has taken.  We think it is the only right and proper course in the circumstances, but is it necessary that there should be such a delay as between now and Wednesday next in the nomination of the new President of the Executive? Could not that be proceeded with to-day?</P>

      <P>The view taken by the Ceann Comhairle in these circumstances is that when the Executive is defeated in the House it should have some opportunity of considering what action it is going to take.  That opportunity was afforded by the adjournment last evening until 12 o'clock to-day. The House should then, I think, have some notice that it would proceed with the nomination of the President of the Executive Council. The Order Paper next prepared would not contain any questions to Ministers.  The first business on the Order Paper would be the nomination of the President of the Executive Council.  I think notice is required of that, not necessarily notice of the name of the person to be proposed, but notice to the members that that is to be the business before the House on a particular day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, a Chinn Comhairle.  Perhaps notice is required, but it is our opinion that the earlier the Dáil proceeds with the nomination the better it would be for the country.  We are prepared to take it at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I think it would be premature to proceed to-day with the nomination of a successor to Deputy Cosgrave.  I agree that the proper course to adopt is <Col N="278" /> that which has been proposed, namely, to adjourn until Wednesday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there is agreement on the motion to adjourn until Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>One point I have in mind is that a delay of this kind is bad for the country.  It creates uncertainty. The state of the country may be a laughing matter to some members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but it is not to us. The country and its interests we have very seriously at heart, and in the interests of the country we do maintain that there should be as brief a delay as possible.  Questions of order, questions of stability, and other important questions arise at such a moment as this.  It is a very serious situation.  We are prepared to take the opportunity, when it arises, of nominating the Leader of this Party as President.  He is, as is known to everybody, in America, and we would like to get him home as soon as possible.  We would like, in the interests of the country, that the situation should be resolved at the earliest possible moment, but if the Ceann Comhairle thinks that Wednesday next is the earliest possible moment, we agree.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle's view is to an extent in agreement with that of Deputy O'Kelly.  I think on an occasion of this kind, when the Government resigns, that the resignation should be announced first to the House and that there should then be an interval between the resignation and the meeting of the House for the nomination of a President of the Executive Council.  I have not expressed the view&mdash;and it is not, of course, for me to express the view&mdash;that the interval should be until Wednesday, but that is the proposal before the House.  That there should be an interval I, as Ceann Comhairle, would have to insist.  I am completely with Deputy O'Kelly that when the House proceeds to the nomination of the President that business should be brought to a conclusion at the <Col N="279" /> earliest possible moment, so that the country would know who the President of the Executive Council was to be.  At the moment the only proposal is that the House should adjourn until Wednesday next.  The Order Paper for that day will be prepared without questions to Ministers <Col N="280" /> and having for its first business the nomination of a President of the Executive Council.  I take it Deputy O'Kelly is now giving notice that he will move on that occasion?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries if he will state when the Captain P.A. Clive Estate, Dooriel, Ballycroy, Co. Mayo, was acquired by the Land Commission; has it yet been vested in the tenants concerned; and, if not, what is the reason for the delay.</P>

      <P>The estate of Captain P.A. Clive is situated on the townlands of Dooriel and three others and was vested in the (late) Congested Districts Board on 28th March, 1912.  The holdings have not yet been vested in the tenants, as many of them are very intermixed and require careful rearrangement. No untenanted land was comprised in this estate and the Land Commission are not yet in a position to arrange for the resale of the lands to the tenants.</P>
