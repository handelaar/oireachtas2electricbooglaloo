      <P>The lands referred to are tenanted lands on the Talbot Estate in the occupation of Daniel Fogarty and Michael Tierney.  The Land Commission decided not to resume these holdings, as in their opinion the lands were unsuitable for division, and in view of the excellent manner in which the tenants have utilised the holdings they decided to resell the lands in their entirety to the occupiers, in whom they have been vested.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Committe in Resolution No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1930, at the rate of three shillings in the pound.</P>
      <P>(2)  That surtax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1930, at the same rates as those at which it was charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1929.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1929, in relation to income tax and surtax shall, subject to the provisions of Part II of the Finance Act, 1929 (No. 32 of 1929), have effect in relation to the income tax and surtax to be charged as aforesaid for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1930.</P>
      <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not. On Resolution No. 1 it would be in order to speak with regard to income tax and surtax.  The Deputy will have an opportunity, on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, to make a statement of the nature he has referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have so often pleaded the case of the small income taxpayer in connection with these Resolutions that it seems almost superfluous to repeat what has been said on former occasions.  I think we must, however, on behalf of almost three-fifths of the income taxpayers, express our keen disappointment that the Minister for Finance has not seen fit to meet the case made, not only from our Benches, but from the Labour and the Independent Benches.  I really think if the Minister had given some consideration to the incidence of income tax, in so far as it relates to the large and the small taxpayer, he would, notwithstanding the opinion he expressed on the Budget statement, see his way, either by some increase in the standard rate or by fixing, as we suggested last year, a limit in respect of the allowance for children, to meet the case that we made for these increased allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there is the question of discrimination in regard to income derived either as profits or as dividends from Irish undertakings. We on this side of the House feel that one of the greatest incentives which the Minister could give either to Irish investors or business men to employ their capital here would be to extend some concession in regard to income tax.  That need not be so large as to impose an appreciable burden on the State, but we feel that any indication on the part of the Minister that enterprise of this kind would receive his sympathetic consideration would have reactions which would be all to the good of industrial development here. Beyond that, I do not intend to detain the House very long, particularly in the circumstances in which we have been meeting these days, <Col N="1549" /> and in which these Resolutions are being considered.</P>
    <P>When the Finance Bill is before the House on the Second Stage, we may take an opportunity of referring to some of the abuses in the present administration of the Act.  I hope to hear from the Minister some justification for the steps which the Revenue Commissioners are taking to collect income tax at the present moment, particularly for the procedure relating to those cases where fraud is either alleged or where false returns are made.  We are informed that the fact has been concealed from the taxpayer that, in cases where a wrongful return has been made, if the taxpayer subsequently withdraws that wrongful return and substitutes a correct one, he is not subject to any penalty. We are informed that that practice is not made known to the public and that in consequence many people, under the impression that they were liable to penalties in respect of returns that, if they were aware of the law, they would have taken steps to amend, have, rather than incur penalty, accepted the alternative of allowing a full investigation dating back many years before 1922. That and some other matters we will take an opportunity of raising on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice, on previous occasions, to take Votes 10 and 11 together.  It is very difficult, in the discussion, to differentiate the matters which will come up for discussion in these two Votes, and it is for that reason I propose to take them together now.</P>

      <P>There is not very much to say under Vote 10.  There is very little difference between this Vote and the Vote asked for last year.  There is a slight increase in the charge for the secretariat and the accounts section.  This is due to the automatic increases of salaries by increments. There is a decrease under Sub-head E, due to the limiting of the Land Loans to farmers under a valuation of £20.  The decrease in that sub-head is not in proportion to the decrease in the loans, because the smaller the number of loans spread over the country is, the more expensive will be the cost of administration in proportion to their number. And in the second place, the staff has already been reduced in anticipation.  There has been a corresponding reduction in the appropriations-in-aid. Coming to Vote 11, there is a net increase of £60,362. For new works, alterations and additions, there is an increase of £34,250, and for maintenance and supplies an increase of £15,588.  Then under Sub-head CC, compensation in lieu of restoration of lands taken over under emergency powers, which is a new item, a sum of £9,900 is to be provided.  There is an increase of £5,000 for drainage maintenance; there is an increase of £14,000 for arterial drainage; there is an increase of £8,500 for purchase of machinery for arterial drainage, and there is a reduction of £15,000 for the Barrow drainage.  There is an increase of £5,475 in appropriations-in-aid. As regards the increase for new works, the most important points are in connection with the Gárda barracks, and the three great Dublin buildings, the General Post Office, the Four Courts and the Custom House.  Then there is the Preparatory Training Colleges, the Broadcasting Stations and the Legations abroad.  In 1929-30 the provision of new barracks for the Gárda Síochána was partly suspended for the sake of economy.  In 1930-31 it is thought necessary to resume that <Col N="1556" /> operation of providing Gárda barracks. There is a total provision of £37,000 made for that.  We are providing for 24 new barracks and for some alternations, etc., in 17 other buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Custom House, its reconstruction has been completed at a cost of £260,000.  It would have cost about three times that amount if the building had been reconstructed from the foundations, but we have used the old walls.  As regards the Four Courts, the latest estimate is put at £400,000, which does not include the greater portion of the furniture.  A provision of £70,000 is made for the year 1930-31, which will very nearly suffice to complete the building.  It is hoped to have the building completed about Easter, 1931.  The latest revised estimate for the General Post Office is £300,000.  The front block, the Henry Street block, and the central block in the courtyard were structurally completed in the course of the year 1929-30.  Certain equipment has not yet been installed in the last-named block.  These three blocks are occupied at present.  The work remaining to be done is at block D, the steel work for which has been erected.  A further contract for this block will be shortly placed and a sum of £26,000 is provided in the Estimate for the current year.  That will mean that about £200,000 will have been expended to date.  It is hoped to complete this building by April, 1932.  With regard to the Preparatory Colleges, besides continuing works already begun at several colleges, we are providing for commencing a new college in Munster and also for adapting the Hibernian Military School buildings, Phænix Park, to the purpose of a preparatory college.  We are also providing for beginning work on a new training college in the Gaeltacht.  Provision is also made for beginning the erection of a central high-power broadcasting station to provide an improved service for the general public which will be within the range of crystal sets.  The Legations in Paris and New York and the <Col N="1557" /> High Commissioner's office in London will require some expenditure for new furniture.  That applies particularly to the Paris Legation.  As regards maintenance, the principal cause for the increase in expenditure under that head is that we did not carry out the usual amount of painting last year.  It was postponed for the sake of economy and it is necessary this year to make up the arrears.  There are also, of course, additional buildings in use, especially preparatory colleges and new Gárda Síochána barracks as well as Legations abroad.</P>
    <P>The explanation of Sub-head CC is that the British took over certain lands under emergency powers during the European War.  Under the Financial Settlement the Saorstát Government has undertaken the liability of restoring these to their owners and paying such compensation for restoration and damages as may be due.  With regard to drainage maintenance and arterial drainage I intend to leave them to the last, as I have to go into them in some detail.  The decrease of £15,000 on the Barrow does not mean any decrease in the amount of work contemplated. We expect to spend £62,000 in 1930-31, but it will be mostly loan money.  The free grant has been mostly spent first.  This diminishes the charge on the counties for interest during construction. There is also an increase for machinery for arterial drainage.  Our experience has shown that excavating machines can be used much more widely than was at first anticipated. The firms from which the machines were purchased have been surprised at the extent to which we have been able to make use of them.  The Irish workers who have been trained into the use of those engines, particularly engine-drivers, have shown an extraordinary aptitude for the work, and and we have been able to use these machines in places where at the outset we had no idea that we could avail of them.  Our intention is to keep a small stock of these machines. At present there are five, and we expect to add five more in 1930-31. The system at present is that these <Col N="1558" /> machines are paid for out of this sub-head, and a hire charge for them is made against each drainage district on which they are used and the amount is credited to appropriations-in-aid. The increases in appropriations-in-aid are chiefly under the heading of rents and fines.  This is due to the completion of the shopping arcade at the General Post Office, and we anticipate getting a considerable sum as fines from incoming tenants of the shops to recoup us for the capital expenditure on them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Drainage Acts I wish to give the House some general account as to where we stand both under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, and the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925.  I think that it is necessary to show how both those Acts are operated.  I fear that their purpose and meaning have grown somewhat dim in the general recollection, as the House rarely hears of them or anything connected with them except by way of complaint in particular cases.  There is usually the grievance that we interfered unnecessarily under the powers given to us in the Act of 1924, which gives the power to intervene without consulting the people interested.  On the other hand, there are complaints that we have not interfered in many cases in which we might have interfered under the Act of 1925.  Under that Act we cannot take any action without the consent and co-operation of the people interested locally. The two Acts are very different in their objects and their methods.  The Act of 1924 was for the purpose of getting old drainage districts restored.</P>
    <P>Before the European war there were in that part of Ireland which has since become the Saorstát, 178 arterial drainage districts in which about £3,000,000 had been invested. It was known that a good deal of this money had ceased to give any return because some of the drainage boards whose business it was to maintain the works had ceased to function or were scamping their work.  The farmers in those districts, <Col N="1559" /> if they had understood their own interests, would have thrown out these drainage boards and elected other men to do the work. They did not, however, do that, either through slackness or because they were afraid of having to pay for the work.  In some districts they were not able to do so because they had not yet become owners of the land and had not the vote.  The Government took rather drastic action in this particular case and introduced and passed the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924 which empowers the Board of Works to inspect all, or any, of these districts, and in any case where they are satisfied that neglect of maintenance is causing damage they are empowered, without consulting the drainage board or the farmers concerned but with only the approval of the Minister for Finance, to go in and restore that district to what it was when first formed, or as near that as it pays to go and even to make small improvements if necessary. When that is done the district is transferred to the county council who are bound, whether they like it or not, to take it over and maintain it, not at the expense of the county rates but out of drainage rates paid by the owners of land in the district.  The cost of the work of restoration is also paid by those owners of land out of the drainage rates, but in order to sweeten this procedure the Minister for Finance has in each case made a free grant, varying from twenty per cent. of the cost upwards, and in some cases the county councils have also made free grants.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that this is a rather arbitrary procedure.  Because the farmers are not ready, or are not able, to act in their own interests the Government steps in and acts for them without consulting them and leaves them to pay the greater part of the cost.  We have had some complaints but so far as my experience goes&mdash;and I have looked carefully into every case that came before me&mdash;these complaints have not <Col N="1560" /> been substantiated in any instance. A great deal of very useful work has been done.  Of the 178 existing drainage districts 147 have been inspected. Many of these were found to be in good condition or, if not in good condition, in such a state that it would not be a profitable operation to restore them.  In 61 districts it was found desirable to carry out restoration works and they have been carried out accordingly at a total cost of £168,100, of which the Government has contributed £46,393 and the county councils £7,130 while the remaining £114,577 is charged upon the owners of improved land. This work has been done rather quickly, with the minimum of preparation and consultation, partly because of the arbitrary procedure authorised by the Act but mainly because it was restoration work and not new schemes.</P>
    <P>Therefore there was in general no question of design&mdash;the only question was how far it was profitable to go&mdash;and there was no question of assessing the benefit, because the benefit had already been assessed on the lands under the old scheme.  The proportional payments were already fixed.  The case is quite different when we come to the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.  Here we are dealing with new schemes and the Government is not at all in the same dogmatic frame of mind as with regard to restoration works.  There is here no question of compulsion. Are any new works of arterial drainage really wanted?  What are they to be?  What will they cost? Who is to pay for them?  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, supplies a procedure for getting an answer to all these questions, and I venture to say it is a good procedure and is getting us sound and satisfactory answers, but I have to admit that it is not working very quickly.  I claim, however, that it is going as quickly as it is safe to go.</P>
    <P>I suggest to those who find the procedure under the Act of 1925 too slow that it is better to be safe than sorry and that the important thing is not to get on quickly with all the <Col N="1561" /> schemes, but to make sure that you do not carry out any scheme which will involve the farmers in a loss.  I would remind the House that we are working on a very much narrower money margin than those who carried out former schemes of arterial drainage.  About £2,000,000 was spent on arterial drainage schemes between the years 1840 and 1860.  By the best information we can get, it costs about five times as much to carry out drainage works now as it did between 1840 and 1860.  But the farmer does not get five times the price for his produce that he did then; therefore the improvement of his land is not worth five times as much as it was then&mdash;far from it. Something like an additional £1,000,000 was spent on arterial drainage works between 1860 and 1900&mdash;mostly before 1881.  It costs about four times as much to carry out drainage works now as it did between 1860 and 1881, but the farmer does not get four times the price for his produce.  Therefore our schemes must, if they are to pay expenses, be cheaper, poorer schemes with shallower channels than those of the nineteenth century, but even so, many schemes which would have paid expenses then will not do so now.</P>
    <P>In another way we are working on a narrower margin also.  If a nineteenth century scheme failed to pay expenses&mdash;and many of them did&mdash; the landlords could afford to pay for it.  Many of them actually did pay for schemes which had involved a loss.  But the tenant purchasers would not relish paying for a losing scheme.  They could not afford to do it in many cases as a matter of fact. I should say that the use of machinery is enabling us to make substantial economies, though it will not bring us near the cheapness of the nineteenth century.  For all these reasons, under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925, it is a case of many being called but few chosen.  The machinery of the Act is set in motion in each case by a group of farmers who think that arterial drainage would improve their lands.  They <Col N="1562" /> send a petition to the county council, indicating roughly the rivers and drains to be excavated and the lands to be improved.  The county council have the position examined by their surveyor, and if the council on his report think the proposal deserves examination they send it on to the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>A total of 555 petitions have been sent to the Board of Works for examination since the passing of the Act, and 49 have been rejected by the county councils as not worth examination.  The flow of petitions is nearly stopped.  It is probable that not many more will be received.  Of these 555 petitions, 500 have been examined by our engineers, and in each case a report has been made showing whether a drainage scheme is practicable or not and giving an estimate of its cost.  This, of course, involves an inspection of the ground in each case and a good deal of calculation. It has meant a very considerable amount of work, though it is only the first stage of the enquiry. Out of the 500 petitions examined, the Board of Works found it necessary to reject 53 as being impracticable or clearly uneconomic or for some other reason, and in 139 other cases the proposal was estimated to cost less than £1,000 and, therefore, has not been dealt with under the Act of 1925.  As the House is aware an Act was passed in 1928&mdash;the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Act&mdash;which empowers the county councils to deal with such schemes on their own account.</P>
    <P>The 500 petitions examined by the engineers were thus reduced to 308, and of these, 240 have been investigated by land valuers to ascertain the benefit to be expected from them to all the different parcels of land affected.  This work is long and laborious.  The valuer has to ascertain the boundaries of each holding, measure the part of it which he expects to be improved by the drainage works and assess the annual value of the improvement, in pounds, shillings and pence in each case.  He must do it carefully, because his results are liable to be disputed by <Col N="1563" /> each of the farmers concerned and tested at a subsequent inquiry and, when so tested, they are the economic foundations of the whole scheme.  Therefore, 240 petitions have been investigated by the valuers and in 32 cases the results showed the proposals to be uneconomic or impracticable and the Board of Works rejected the petitions at that stage.  This leaves 208 petitions still alive.  Of these no further proceedings have yet been taken on 59, The remaining 149 have been amalgamated into 90 drainage schemes, because often we get two or three separate petitions for different parts of the same river and it is necessary or desirable to make one scheme of them.  These 90 schemes have been submitted either to the Minister for Finance or to the county councils, or both, for the free grants necessary if they are to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in each case, that is in the 76 cases submitted to him, has agreed to the grant required, but the county councils have refused the grant in eighteen cases and have given no decision in 13 cases.  I wish it to be understood that I am not criticising the county councils.  It is their right and duty to form their own opinion whether each drainage scheme is or is not sufficiently desirable to justify them in imposing on the county rates the charge for a contribution.  Of the 90 schemes submitted to the Minister for Finance or the county councils, 56 have so far emerged with the necessary promise of free grants and these are to be submitted to the occupiers of land affected. Forty-six have been so submitted up to the present.  Of these the occupiers by their votes have accepted 32; they have rejected 12, and in two cases the result of the voting is not yet known.</P>
    <P>After the acceptance of a scheme by the occupiers, there has usually to be an inquiry into objections.  In three cases so far this inquiry has shown such serious objections that the scheme has had to be dropped. In eighteen cases so far all preliminary difficulties have been overcome <Col N="1564" /> and works have been begun.  In five cases out of these eighteen the works have been completed.  The process is continuous; more schemes are always coming up and reaching the stage where works begin.  It is clear that we have work on our hands for some years to come at an average rate of perhaps £40,000 or £50,000 a year.  How many schemes altogether will be carried out under the Act must be a matter of conjecture.  My guess would be, if the present conditions continue, 50 schemes altogether costing perhaps a quarter of a million of money of which the Government free grants may amount to something over £100,000: that is, if the Government continues to give free grants on the present scale and if the county councils continue to give contributions in a good proportion of cases.  It is quite clear that if the Government ceases to give, or if the Dáil ceases to approve, free grants, the whole thing will stop dead; and if the county councils ceased to give contributions there would be very few schemes carried out.</P>
    <P>Now, the Vote before the House represents, of course, only the Government's free grants to the works which are expected to be carried out during the financial year 1930-31; the other part of the expenditure is provided for under Vote 8 (Local Loans).</P>
    <P>Sub-head J 1, Drainage Maintenance, shows an increase because it is anticipated that a restoration scheme may be carried out in the Lough and River Corrib district, a large drainage district in which a considerable expenditure is desirable.  We do not expect to have much more work under the Drainage Maintenance Act for some years to come; the Corrib is an exceptional case.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head J 2 represents the best estimate we can make of the free grants which will be needed under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, during the year 1930-31.  Large schemes in which the total free grant is over £3,000 are shown individually, and if it should prove desirable to make free grants <Col N="1565" /> for any large scheme other than those here shown, we shall introduce a supplementary estimate.  Schemes for which the estimated free grant is less than £3,000 are not shown individually, but I shall be happy to give any information I have about any particular scheme in which Deputies may be interested.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything on the other sub-heads at present, as most of them are matters of considerable detail and it is very hard to know what particular points Deputies are interested in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on the estimate this year.  Last year, I had a good deal to say in regard to a practice of some officials of the Department, and the Parliamentary Secretary gave what I think may be described as a very emphatic promise that we would not have any cause to complain this year in that connection.  I should like if, in the course of his reply, he would state that that undertaking has been fulfilled.</P>
      <P>One thing I am disappointed with in regard to his statement is that he made no mention of a problem which was exercising the minds of a considerable number of people on the east coast last year&mdash;that is in regard to coast erosion.  A good deal of hardship was caused in that connection and it is very probable that last year will not see the end of the matter.  For that reason, we would have thought the Parliamentary Secretary or the Board of Works might have given some attention to this matter and would have made provision in the estimates to deal with it, if it should arise in the same acute form this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the amount of work carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, I think the House, having heard the account of the Parliamentary Secretary, will say that it is a case of &ldquo;much ado about nothing.&rdquo; They started off in 1925 with a total of about 594 schemes submitted to the Department, and of them at least ninety have been examined by the valuers appointed by the Department and were considered to be <Col N="1566" /> economic schemes which it would be justifiable to proceed with.  But we find, after five years of activity on the part of the Department, and of unquestionable desire on the part of those who are interested and who would have benefitted by the schemes, that we have work proceeding in the case of only 18 at present.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies will concede that the contrast between the figures of 594 petitions and 18 schemes now proceeding is a very disappointing one.  If at least 20 per cent. of the schemes would have been economic, I think in the present circumstances and in the present condition of the country, with the dearth of employment, with the crying need to develop and to improve our agricultural land, that the Government should take some steps to find the money necessary. If the county councils cannot of themselves accept the burden, I think the Government ought to find the money to proceed with these schemes where their own valuers have found the work would yield an economic return.  Apart from that altogether, an argument might be advanced in support of even a greater measure of activity on the part of the Department in this connection than has hitherto taken place. I think we might even go further and say that as regards these schemes, where even the return would not be economic, the local conditions would justify, from the point of view of some relief to the unemployment problem, the expenditure of public money, and that these schemes should receive favourable consideration also from the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general administration of the Department this year I have no very great complaint to make.  It is obvious from the estimate that there has been a great tightening up of administration.  I only hope that that tightening up will continue and that this Department, which is one of the most important from the point of view of public expenditure and from the <Col N="1567" /> point of view of public well-being, will become the model Department of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice under Vote 11 that there is a sub-head dealing with parks, and I see that £700 is provided for maintenance and supplies at the Curragh.  I happen to be the Ranger of the Curragh, but, as a matter of fact, it means nothing but the title, because the person who does all the work is the Deputy Ranger, by some extraordinary arrangement which was established by the British.  In fact, I have no control over the Curragh whatever.  It is rather an anomalous position, but such is the case.  I am advised that there is an urgent necessity for certain sanitation to be carried out at the Curragh in connection with the racing there.  Whether the money for that can be recovered from the Turf Club I do not know, but I think the work would have to be done by the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say on the matter, because there is an outcry about this, and it is a matter of very urgent necessity and ought to be attended to.  There are a great many race meetings in the year there and, as I say, it is a matter of urgent public necessity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Shannon navigation scheme, there is very considerable dissatisfaction in some areas affected by flooding, particularly Tarmonbarry.  Various representations have been made from time to time to the Board of Works with a view to having some alterations made there that would remedy the flooding.  As a result of representations an inspector was sent down some years ago, and he reported that 4,025 acres were affected by flooding in County Roscommon and 2,057 in County Leitrim.  That was the only result of the inspection and the flooding still continues.  I might mention that it has been asserted by the Board of Works that any improvement made to remedy the flooding would mean a very <Col N="1568" /> heavy outlay, as they would have to sink at least for a distance of a mile the navigation course in the cut.  It is also asserted by the Board of Works that even then the improvement in the area affected would be very slight.  The people concerned asked for the removal of the weir at Tarmonbarry.  That may be a sweeping demand, but in view of the amount of traffic and in view of the area of land affected by the floods, the suggestion has a good deal to recommend it.  The figures given by the Board of Works show that the total amount of tonnage carried north of Tarmonbarry is 12,450.  The tolls collected represent £203 14s. 8d., and the cost of working the scheme is given as £904 12s. 11d.&mdash;as against the £203 14s. 11d. by way of tolls.  That area has a very good service from the railway, which runs parallel.  Now there is a very good motor service, and it is held that the continuation of the weir is entirely unnecessary from a traffic point of view.</P>
      <P>In view of the figures I have given, there is no justification for keeping a barrier there in the way of the water.  It is five feet at low water and eight feet in flood and is responsible for the flooding of practically the entire area to which I referred. It does seen entirely unnecessary and a waste of public money to keep in existence that water course, resulting in the flooding of the area round about, for the sake of the traffic it serves.  The Board of Works should surely have regard to the very extensive damage caused by the retention of this water course.  If it is not considered a practical suggestion to remove the Tarmonbarry weir entirely, it might be possible to continue the service by taking a few feet off the weir or, perhaps, by the adoption of flat-bottomed boats that would take a more shallow draught.  It might be possible, in that way, to continue the service and still make provision to relieve the area of this very expensive flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards drainage schemes, Co. Leitrim has refused after very considerable investigation to adopt a <Col N="1569" /> scheme.  They found it to be impracticable so far as their county was concerned.  It should be the duty of the Board of Works to see that schemes submitted by a county like Leitrim, which is waterlogged and more in need of drainage than any other county in Ireland, receive from them that consideration that the needs of the county deserve.  I consider that it is a great waste of public money to have inspectors sent out from the Board of Works to investigate some hundreds and even thousands of cases all over the country and then merely reject them.  The result is negative as far as that sort of investigation goes. The Board of Works should have more elastic powers and should exercise them.  Where schemes may not fit in with the exact requirements of their existing rules, they should be able to deal with the peculiar local circumstances in order to make such schemes practicable.  It is quite unfair that some of the poorer counties, like Leitrim, that cannot adopt such a scheme as this for economic reasons are still compelled to pay for the improvement conferred on the more well-to-do counties who are in a position to adopt such a scheme.  Surely, the Board of Works, in order to be of real service to the whole community, should be in a position, as a result of its investigations, to make recommendations from time to time to the Dáil and to get powers to enable them to carry through schemes in all counties which would be of particular advantage to the counties affected, and not to have them tied up by a particular scheme which is altogether impracticable in particular cases.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, most of the time of the board is spent in investigating large numbers of applications, and when these are inspected they are found to be impracticable and are turned down.  That is not a justification for the continuation of a public institution like the Board of Works.  Its purpose should be to make its service real and to do that it should come down to local requirements, <Col N="1570" /> and where they found there were peculiar local circumstances they should have powers to meet those circumstances in the various counties.</P>

      <P>I wish to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a matter of some importance&mdash;that is, the delay that takes place in the Department in reaching a decision as to the handing over to the people of burned down buildings that were formerly used as barracks when application is made for them.  An application was made some time ago on behalf of the people of Bandon for a burned-down military barrack there, to be used for the purpose of erecting a public hall.  I understand that application is held up because of a view entertained that that building might be necessary for some other purpose. The suggestion some time ago was that it might be used for the purpose of erecting a new barrack for housing members of the Gárda Síochána. I think that is unlikely, in view of the economies that took place on the Vote last year.  Any expenditure of that kind, which would be very big, is not likely to be incurred for some time to come.  A demand has been made by the people of the town for the disposal of the building to them in order to erect a public hall upon the site.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary might inquire as to the cause of the delay in this matter, and, generally, in regard to other applications in connection with buildings of that kind.</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be any reasonable cause for keeping on hand old buildings that are not likely to prove of any use to the Department. It would be much better that they should be utilised for some local purpose, especially when the purpose for which it is sought is one that would be of advantage to the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to drainage schemes, I regret that more progress has not been made and I regret particularly that in the county from which I come the local authorities have not been very helpful in the matter.  The <Col N="1571" /> county council refused or failed to put forward any petition but one to the Board of Works, and while I feel I can say very little to the Department upon that matter, I would like to suggest that some arrangement might be made, or that some amendments of the law might be effected whereby, if necessary, pressure might be put upon the local authorities to have schemes which would be of economic advantage examined.  If that could be done, I think it would be very advisable.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this particular matter of the demand of the people of the town of Bandon for the disposal of the old barrack for the purpose for which they have asked.  I ask him to ascertain what is the cause of the delay that has taken place, and to endeavour to have a decision in this matter conveyed to the people as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>About the middle of the last century a fairly extensive drainage scheme was carried out in the County Waterford, known locally as the Bricka Drainage Scheme.  They had a canal built and the charge was assessed over the affected area in a certain proportion.  Two or three years ago the local county council made an application to the authorities for what was understood to be a loan to grant to carry out some cleaning in connection with this drainage.  The result has not been at all satisfactory.  The expense incurred was entirely out of proportion to the amount of work that was done in connection with it and many of the people affected, to their great surprise, were informed that they would have to pay a special drainage rate for the next fifteen or sixteen years to cover the cost.  Unfortunately it was only when the people got this bill that they realised what they were up against, and now they are faced with the possibility of having to pay an increased rate again for maintenance for a period of years, and they want to know is there any possibility of avoiding this <Col N="1572" /> extra charge for maintenance.  They have, of course, to pay this charge already levied on them because the work is done, but many of them claim that they derive no benefit whatsoever from it, and in one or two cases with which I am familiar I really believe that contention is correct, that the individual farmers derive no benefit from it.  They want to know, if this thing is to continue, where they will find themselves. The rates for drainage alone will be far in excess of the ordinary poor rate.  They consider it a decided grievance if they have to continue to pay for work from which they derive no benefit whatever.</P>
      <P>There is a matter in connection with contracts.  Is it usual to advertise contracts given out by the Board?  For instance, large works carried out here in Dublin city, the renovation of the G.P.O. and of the Custom House and the Four Courts. Were these contracts advertised and if not advertised what was the system adopted in allocating these contracts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree on that point anyway, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that proper sanitary accommodation is erected on the Curragh for people attending the races.  As his chief the Minister for Finance does not intend to abolish the betting tax <Col N="1573" /> on race courses and as he has a surplus from last year I think he could usefully spend that in erecting the sanitary accommodation that is needed there.  I hope he will mention that to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to and that is the delay in paying compensation under the Employers' Liability Insurance Act to men who were injured on the Barrow Drainage Scheme.  Some cases have come to my notice lately and payment has not been made for four, five and six weeks.  I need not tell you that that is a great hardship on the wives or dependents of the injured men.  I have called to the insurance branch of his Department several times and I must say that the officials were very courteous and tried to hasten the payment as much as possible.  The procedure is somewhat complicated and I think if the Minister looks into the matter he could make it a little bit more elastic and see that payment is made say a fortnight after the accident has taken place.  It is a very important point and I think the Minister could easily help these poor fellows who got injured on the Barrow. In the Minister's desire for using machinery instead of hand labour and foot labour on the Barrow he has introduced dredgers and the men are injured very often.  I hope he will take particular care in seeing that the interests of the men so far as accident insurance is concerned, are looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I would like to mention, and that is the Lerr drainage district in South Kildare.  Some time ago the county council sent up a request asking the Department to send down one of its engineering inspectors to go over the Lerr drainage scheme with the county surveyor and see whether there was any justification for the complaints made by men in South Kildare, the county council and others, who said that instead of improving the Lerr river it was made worse.  I do not <Col N="1574" /> believe these men are correct in their charges against the Board of Works, but I do say that I think it is only right that the Minister should issue an authoritative statement showing the improvements made for the money that is being spent there. As I am implicated and put down as the culprit for having that scheme carried out, I think it is only fair that the Minister should justify his Department and myself and have an authoritative statement of the case published.</P>

When we were discussing that with the Department before, they said it was very difficult to do anything, but I understood them to say that if the scheme were re-opened and anything else done, some change in the burden might be made.  There are a lot of people on that stream who get no benefit whatever from the scheme as originally done, but if, as I understand, there is some talk now of re-opening the scheme and redoing the work or improving the scheme, perhaps on the reorganisation of the scheme, the burden of the rate would be put upon those who really get the benefit and be taken off those who get really no benefit from it.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the filthy state of the River Shannon in and around Athlone. I wrote to the Department in or about July about the state of the river.  It was full of weeds and full of river matter coming up to the <Col N="1575" /> surface.  I received a reply stating they were sending down an inspector. The inspector came and reported, and I received a communication that this matter would be looked into.  A month or so passed and I called to the Department and interviewed a very prominent official of the Department.  I was told that they were waiting for the weeds to finish growing.  I wonder what would be the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary now.  I suppose he will tell us: &ldquo;We are waiting for the weeds to grow and when they are finished growing we will cut them next September, or some other time.&rdquo;  Everyone who knows the River Shannon knows it is a fine river for fishing.  You are encouraging tourists to come here and fish and to run motor boats on the river, and it is a very strange thing if a large river like that is to be left in the filthy state it is in at the moment. Another thing I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to, and he mentioned it in his opening statement, is the high-power station to be erected in Athlone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a matter which is causing great difficulty to the county councils in the matter of drainage.  It is the case where a drainage scheme adjoins two counties and two county councils are concerned.  Now in those cases the Board of Works make their estimates and according to their valuation there is a certain local contribution to be made before the scheme can be economic.  There is one such <Col N="1576" /> case before my mind at the moment. In this case one of the county councils has agreed to make the contribution. The other has refused and the whole work, although of very great importance, is held up.  I would like to know what steps the Parliamentary Secretary, or his Department, proposes to take in order to rectify that.  If two county councils are concerned in a joint drainage scheme and cannot be got to agree what steps are to be taken to see that the work is carried out? The drainage scheme I refer to is the Lough Gara Drainage Scheme.  If the Ministry do not propose to take some steps to see that the work is carried out there is another proposal being put up or about to be put up, I understand, by one of the county councils that the work be done in a different manner, and I hope if the matter does come properly before the Board of Works that it will get the attention which it deserves.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Maguire, that is, the weir on the river Shannon near Tarmonbarry, we have various complaints made from the Roscommon County Council about the flooding of that district and in connection with the flooding of that district they find that unless something is done there will remain in that district thousands of acres of land under water. I think last year the Minister made a remark that nothing could be done until the further development of the Shannon.  I am afraid if we are to wait until it affects this particular district we will be waiting for a very long time.  I am very anxious that the Minister would deal with that matter of the joint river because it affects us very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to state what position the proposed scheme for the River Robe is in now.  I raised this matter on a few occasions before.  The county council was asked to give a guarantee.  It gave the guarantee, and still nothing is being done.  This is one of the schemes to which Deputy Brennan <Col N="1577" /> has referred, in which two counties are interested.  That objection only came in at the very last moment when it was discovered that about 400 acres in the County of Galway would be included in the scheme.  I understand this is the reason why the scheme has been held up.  The Parliamentary Secretary is quite aware that this is very urgent and pressing, that, in fact, for generations it has caused enormous loss to the farmers in that district, and is causing enormous loss every year.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, would make a clear statement as to how the proposal now stands, and if he would give any guarantee as to whether the work will be undertaken in the near future.  During the discussion on the Local Government Estimate I asked the Minister for Local Government what was the reason of the delay in the minor drainage schemes in Co. Mayo.  He told me I did not understand the Act.  I now find that the position is that all petitions that were lodged under the 1925 Act in Co. Mayo had not been reported on when the 1928 Act came into operation, that is after four years.  None of the schemes has been reported on by the Board of Works, though the County Surveyor and the Assistant Surveyor reported favourably on the work.  That being so, the Mayo Co. Council refused to go to the trouble of considering schemes under the 1928 Act.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give an explanation as to the reason of that delay.</P>
      <P>There is another defect in the Acts that, if a scheme is considered by the county council and reported upon favourably by the County Surveyor, and if the Board of Works engineer turns down that scheme the county council has to bear one-third of the cost of his inspection.  I do not think that is at all reasonable.  I think the Board of Works should bear the full cost of their own inspection. We heard the Parliamentary Secretary stating that new legislation is contemplated.  There should be some clause put into any new Bill to that effect.</P>

      <P>Year after year I have had to draw the attention of the House and of the Parliamentary Secretary to the existence outside this House of a caricature of a late sovereign.  It is quite obvious to me that the ordinary members of the House have no desire that that caricature should remain there, and the Parliamentary Secretary has refused year after year to remove it.  I would ask him in the course of this financial year at least to make inquiries as to what the financial cost would be of removing that caricature from outside the Parliament of the Irish Free State.</P>
      <P>There is another point in connection with the Estimate for this Department, and that is with regard to the Phænix Park.  The Board of Works have very kindly consented to give some facilities for the boys playing football in the Phænix Park on Saturdays and Sundays by providing water facilities from the main.  There are other facilities which possibly they could provide and which would be of great benefit not only to the boys themselves but to their parents, that is increased facilities as far as huts are concerned. At the moment large numbers of boys play football in the Phænix Park, which is really the playing ground of the youth of Dublin, and you find, particularly in the winter, that boys have to undress in the open and have to leave their clothes on the sidelines, where their small valuables are liable to be stolen, and in any case they have very often to dress again in wet clothes.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would consent to advocate the spending of the small sum of about £500 for the provision of extra facilities in the Phænix Park I think it would be highly appreciated, not only by the boys but by their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the outcry as to coast erosion that there was all over the country, and the necessity for that outcry during the very heavy winter we had last year, one would have thought that the Parliamentary Secretary would refer in <Col N="1579" /> some way to the deliberations, if he has received any report yet, of the Coast Erosion Commission.  Surely that Commission has been sitting sufficiently long to be able to send in some sort of a report, even if it were only a tentative one.  We are now well into the month of May, and if anything is going to be done to save our coasts surely it is at this time of the year that it ought to be done. This country has been spending an amount of money for the past five or six years with the very laudable object of getting tourists to come here, but if our seaside resorts are going to be neglected, as they have been by the Board of Works for a considerable time, I feel that the activities of the Tourist Development Association will be all in vain.</P>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say something as to what is going to be the outcome of the sittings of this Commission.  I am commencing to think now, as others thought when it was set up, that it was merely eyewash.  Surely it is high time for that Commission to have reported.  One would think that it would take them only three or four weeks in order to get the data required to enable them to come to some conclusion.  In the constituency which I represent, from Carnsore Point right along the coast up to Arklow has been very seriously menaced during the last winter.  Not alone have we had coast erosion at Rosslare and other places but the effect of it has been that the bar outside Wexford town has silted up in the last few weeks, with the result that three steamers going into Wexford had to be diverted to Rosslare Harbour.  That is a very serious thing for a port like Wexford, which has a very small revenue as it is.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will say something about this matter and that he will endeavour to get the Commission to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  That has been sitting for a considerable time and nobody knows what is being done.  A great many harbour authorities have certain things in <Col N="1580" /> their minds to do but are loth to spend any money owing to the fact that they do not know where they stand.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will refer to these two important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to refer to the drainage schemes.  At least ninety per cent. of the schemes all over the country have been turned down because they were uneconomic, and I see no prospect of these schemes ever being carried out except the matter is reconsidered and some new method adopted. There is no doubt that they are necessary.  If we are going to have schemes carried out by the Department or by the county council, with overseers, with what is known as State hours, I can see that the work will not be done.  In my opinion, the only way to do it is to adopt a different plan.  I think you will have to get committees of the people benefiting by these schemes, acting under an engineer, either a county council engineer or an engineer from the Board of Works, and that these committees should have power to do the work themselves, with the power of employing and dismissing.  It is all very well for Deputy Davin to laugh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It might require legislation, but it is a suggestion that could be considered as an alternative to the present system.  If you are to put into effect ninety per cent. of the drainage schemes throughout the country you will have to get at it in some other way.  Committees of the people whose lands will be benefited should be created and they should be given power to employ their own labour, the labour of their children and their workers and outside people if necessary, under the supervision of an engineer. Better work would be done in that way, because it would be done by people who knew something about it, not as in the case of a number of the schemes, by people who knew nothing about the work and who were practically no good for that class of work, because the employment they previously had was no training for it.</P>
      <P>If you want the country to benefit I think you will have to go outside the cut-and-dried schemes that you have and do it in the way that I suggest, not like some of the Government work under the Board of Works that they have been doing at the Curragh.  We go by old time and they go by new time, and they are dismissed there every evening at four o'clock according to our time. You would not do very much on those lines.</P>

He is not here to do work of any advantage to his party, to the community he says he represents, or to the country as a whole.  When speaking on drainage the Parliamentary Secretary might give some information as to why certain schemes are being held up.  These are schemes which have been prepared and on which the men might be let loose, so to speak, at any moment.  I have in mind several schemes in Clare. One at Scariff has been in hands for a long time, and there are schemes at Newmarket-on-Fergus, Sixmilebridge, Manus and Doonbeg.  These schemes have been ready for some time and there is no reason why they should be held up or why operations should not start immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand some of the things that happened in connection with the Shannon Scheme.  Certain lock-keepers have been dismissed and, notwithstanding the fact that they are redundant people, ready for employment, getting very little compensation <Col N="1583" /> for loss of employment, people were imported from the Six Counties and elsewhere to do simple work that the lock-keepers could do. It seems strange that lock-keepers who are perfectly capable of doing certain non-technical work are not allowed to do so but are given miserable compensation and new hands taken on.  That does not seem to be the proper way to do business.  The compensation given the lock-keepers is miserable and no attempt has been made to commute it.  They are getting from £10 to £13 a year and they have lost their employment and no attempt is made to commute these amounts so that they might be given sums to enable them to start in business. That is a hardship on these men, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should make representations to the Department of Finance with a view to seeing if an alteration could be made in the arrangement.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here repeatedly to coast erosion, and I think no coast in Ireland suffers more in that respect than County Clare.  The inroads made by the sea on the coast of Clare are likely to wipe out several towns and several sources of income to the county. Lahinch will be wiped out unless the Government interferes immediately in an effective manner.  I do not think any steps have been taken to save the town.  Steps have not been taken to bore to find out how deep they would have to go down to find blue mud on which works could be erected.  As Deputy Corish said, it is time that the Commission now sitting gave some information as to what it proposes to do. If action is not taken quickly in the constituency I represent several towns will be practically wiped out. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has taken action, if he has some data from the Commission, to check coast erosion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only item I wish to refer to is that dealing with arterial drainage, which I think is the most important matter in the <Col N="1584" /> Estimate.  The question of flooding by the River Shannon has been referred to, and the point was made that over 4,000 acres were flooded in Roscommon by the overflow of the river at Tarmonbarry.  The suggestion was made that if the weir was removed matters would be improved and flooding prevented.  I do not altogether agree that that would meet the situation, because at certain times the water at each side of the weir, particularly at flood-time, is at the same level, and I am afraid the removal of the weir would not cause a great improvement.  I think at a reasonable expenditure the river could be widened at a point where it is very narrow.  I suggest that that is a matter for the Government and that it should be seriously considered by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given figures in connection with the drainage schemes that have been submitted to the Board of Works. His statement shows that progress in connection with the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 is very slow indeed.  I think he stated that 46 schemes had been submitted to the county councils&mdash;that is a small number out of the hundreds sent forward&mdash;and he mentioned that only 32 had been agreed to, and five rejected. In the county which I represent&mdash;and I presume it is an average county&mdash;we submitted a number of schemes.  I think six have been agreed to by the Board of Works. One has been carried out.  In four cases the county council has agreed to give a contribution.  One scheme was rejected by the occupiers because they did not believe they would get sufficient benefit from it. A majority of occupiers assented to another scheme, and one scheme is now before the occupiers.  I have already pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the officials of the Board of Works that I think some schemes are not getting a fair chance.  I know occupiers of land who are most anxious to get drainage carried out.  I know one case that was rejected but I am not <Col N="1585" /> familiar with the cause of the rejection in the other cases.  In one area, where they approved of the scheme, it was almost rejected because of the manner in which it was presented by the Board of Works.  I do not say that that was the fault of the Board of Works.  Whoever the valuer was who went to the area, he did the work in such a manner as to cause great danger of the scheme being rejected. I will explain what I mean, with a view to having a little more care taken by the Board of Works with regard to schemes sent forward. For instance, one man's name was put in the schedule for a number of acres that was greater than the amount of land he possessed.  On investigation, I found that land belonging to four other people surrounding his land was put down in the map in his name.  That is only one instance, but I am afraid if care is not taken by the valuers who go down the same thing may happen in other cases.  What would happen naturally in such cases is that the owner would oppose a scheme, whereas if the amount of land owned by each person was put down correctly probably the owner would vote for the scheme.  I do not know if anything of the kind I have mentioned has occurred in connection with the scheme rejected in Roscommon. Greater care should be taken, as the people are most anxious that drainage schemes should be carried out.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to another scheme which concerned Roscommon, and it was suggested that County Sligo, the adjoining county, had refused to adopt the scheme and that something should be done by the Board of Works.  I am not quite sure if that is an accurate statement.  As far as I am aware, Sligo County Council is awaiting a petition from the people in the area, and I am not aware that the county council has power to refuse a petition if it is sent in.  I am glad the matter has been raised, because it concerns the county I represent. These are the only items to which I want to refer.  My object in referring <Col N="1586" /> to them is that these schemes, which the people are anxious to have carried out, should get a fair chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items to which I wish to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. One is in connection with Bunerana harbour and pier, in respect of which the House is now asked to vote an additional £9,000.  I understand this is part of the sum which was voted by the British Government in pre-war times to the Irish Development Fund and handed over to the present Government. My object in referring to this is to complain of the delay that has taken place in getting the work properly under way.  I understand that this work was to have been started quite a considerable time ago.  It is true that a start has been made on it, but up to the present only a comparatively small number of men are engaged on the work.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the matter up with his Department with a view to having the work speeded up so that more employment may be given in Buncrana area.  Unfortunately a very large number of men are unemployed there at present.  They are expecting to get jobs on this work.  I do not know whether the delay that has taken place in proceeding with the work is due to the non-arrival of a dredger at Bunerana or not, but, whatever the cause of the delay, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that immediate steps are taken to speed up the work, and thereby give much-needed employment in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter relating to harbours to which I desire to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  In connection with Dun Laoghaire harbour the House is asked to vote a sum of £20,114; for Howth harbour a sum of £2,274, and for Dunmore East harbour a sum of £730.  I understand there is a statutory obligation on the Department to provide certain moneys in respect of these harbours and piers.  I think the time has arrived when this whole question of old statutory agreements <Col N="1587" /> should be reviewed.  For instance, this House has voted for a number of years past a sum of over £2,000 per annum for the maintenance and dredging of Howth harbour. I maintain that there are other harbours in the Saorstát much more in need of dredging than Howth and that the same attention is not being paid to them.  There are a large number of harbours throughout the country which, if improved, would give employment to fisher-folk. Unfortunately, as we are all aware, the fishing in Howth at the present time, and for some years past, has been a comparative failure, notwithstanding the amount of money spent annually on the harbour there.  I suggest the time has now arrived when these old statutory agreements should be looked into so that instead of Dun Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East harbours getting all the money, harbours in other parts of the country would be allocated a share.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary when replying will let us know when we may expect to have the report of the Port and Harbours Tribunal.  We have been expecting that report for quite a considerable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee is not present in the House, but I may say that the matter which he raised is being settled in such a way as to give satisfaction to all parties.  With regard to the question of coast erosion, that of course is an extremely difficult matter.  It has been exercising the attention of my Department and of other departments for a considerable time.  The enormity of the task is illustrated by the fact that we have had Deputies from the West and from the East of Ireland raising the question.  There is a Committee inquiring into the matter at the present time.  I am not in a position to say when that Committee will be able to report, but I am afraid it will not be for some considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither would I like to raise false hopes in the case of the people residing in the towns concerned.  I am not at all sure that the Government <Col N="1588" /> will be able to come to the assistance&mdash;at any rate financially&mdash; of the districts that are suffering. As regards professional assistance, we are always ready to give that. In every case where a desire has been expressed by the people in towns that have suffered in any way to get professional assistance we have immediately sent experts to the spot to see what could be done.  But as regards the State coming to the aid of these towns in a financial way &mdash;seeing that there are very large areas affected&mdash;I am afraid I would be erring on the side of optimism if I were to say that we were likely to do anything in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, in dealing with the question of arterial drainage, appeared to be speaking under a slight misapprehension.  He seemed to think that a great many of these schemes were economic, and that it was owing to the cumbersome method that we adopted of investigating them that more work had not been done.  As a matter of fact, in not a single case that we have investigated were any of these schemes economic. In every case grants were required. It is only a question of how much the Government in one case, and the county council in another, is prepared to lose in order to carry out these schemes.  No scheme that has come before us up to the present would pay of its own accord.  Adverting to Deputy Gorey's remarks, there is no doubt that if the farmers themselves would come together and form local committees they could do the work much cheaper than we could do it.  If we carry out a scheme we have to ensure that it is watertight from every angle, so that there can be no complaints that we have bungled the job.  But if the farmers themselves were to come together and form committees they could do a great deal of rough-and-ready work.  They could benefit their lands to a very considerable extent if they were willing to do that.  Unfortunately up to the present they have expressed no desire to come together and carry out that kind of work.</P>

      <Col N="1589" /> Deputy Wolfe referred to the question of sewerage on the Curragh. That matter has not been brought to our attention.

      <P>As I have said, the matter has never been brought to our notice, but we are prepared to look into it to see if we can do anything. Tarmonbarry was referred to.  This, of course, is an old chestnut on this Vote.  We maintain that, if this weir were removed, it would not ameliorate the conditions to any extent worth while.  Any appreciable change to improve the drainage at that particular point would cost a considerable amount of money.  We estimate the cost at £100,000.  If we were to put that charge on that particular district it would not be able to bear it, and what the carrying out of the work would mean is that we would then have to give an exorbitant grant, a grant that in the circumstances would be wholly unwarranted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a more economic scheme, but not a model scheme.  The question was raised as to what procedure we should adopt in cases where the Government was prepared to give a large grant to make the drainage schemes economic, and where two or more county councils are involved and one council was prepared to contribute and another council was not, and as a result of their refusal to contribute a scheme was held up.  We have had a few cases of that kind.  As a general rule, unless in exceptional cases, if the county councils are not prepared <Col N="1590" /> to pull their weight and make a small contribution, we leave the scheme alone.  There are plenty of councils anxious to go ahead with their schemes.  At present we have sufficient work on hands, and we are not going to trouble our heads about districts that have no interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>In some cases the main part of the drainage is in a particular county and only a small part of the work has to be carried out in another county.  If the county mainly concerned is willing to give a grant, in such a case we are prepared to go ahead and ignore that part of the work which it was intended to carry out in another county.  The river Robe, which is an important river and one where we have a considerable scheme in view, is one of that kind.  The main part of the work&mdash; in fact, 99½ per cent. of the work&mdash; will be carried out in Mayo.  There is a small part of Galway which will come under the scheme, but that county refuses to contribute.  We are anxious that Galway should step into line and pull their weight, but if they do not we are prepared to go ahead without them.  At present we have valuers working on the scheme and doing all they can to push it ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to our delay in dealing with the military barracks at Bandon.  He says the popular demand is that these barracks should be used as a town hall. I have heard very little from the people who are anxious to make use of it in that particular way.  Up to the present the more urgent demand is to have the barracks used as a creamery, and, considering that is a very useful purpose and one that should be encouraged in every way, I was anxious to give it favourable consideration, but I think those who are interested in that project have since dropped the idea of going ahead with it.  The Gárda Síochána are also anxious to use that building, and their claim will have to be considered. I promised Deputy Murphy that this is a matter I will look into and give sympathetic consideration <Col N="1591" /> to.  Deputy Colohan raised a rather novel point about the delay in paying insurance compensation to workers injured on the Barrow scheme.  I have not heard anything about that before.  Of course, we have to report to the insurance company which covers us in such cases, and some delay may possibly have occurred while those negotiations were proceeding, but I do not think the Deputy can have very many cases to complain about.  Certainly it is a matter that has not been brought to my notice before.  Deputy Goulding referred to the Brica drainage scheme which is being carried out under the 1924 Drainage Act.  That work is now being completed, and the charging order is being put through.  We have no power to vary the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficulty we are up against.  We are accused in one quarter of delay, and in another of having proceeded where we should not have proceeded. The best technical brains at our command advised us that it is an economic scheme, and if the farmers object to pay we cannot help that.  It is of considerable benefit to the people in the district.</P>

      <P>Where a scheme has been decided on and where there is clear evidence that one section of the farmers are getting benefit and another section are not, would there be no way of reorganising this scheme so as to have the burdens fall on the people who are really getting the benefit?  Is there no elasticity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under the present legislation.  If there are anomalies of that kind it would be a matter for future legislation.  The 1924 Act is quite rigid, but if we go under the 1925 Act it would only mean additional charges.  Some Deputy&mdash; I think Deputy Goulding&mdash;asked a question about contracts.  Our custom is to advertise all contracts over £500.  That practice was adhered to in the case of the Four Courts, and all big buildings, and in the case of most of the national schools throughout the country.  Deputy Hogan referred to some delay in connection with drainage schemes in County Clare.  I think that on the whole Clare has been fairly well served under the Drainage Acts.  He referred to Scariff, Newmarket-on-Fergus, Six-mile-bridge, and the Doonbeg and Manus Rivers.  The Scariff scheme has been held up, as we had to make additional inquiries, and there may be some minor alterations necessary.  The other schemes are ready for confirmation, and we expect to be working on them this season.  Deputy Cassidy complained of the delay in starting the work in connection with Buncrana harbour. A good deal of the delay was because people locally took a long time to make up their minds with regard to giving the necessary local grants. We have now started work there. We have only a small number of men employed up to the present, but they are only doing preliminary work.  When we get properly under way we expect to give considerable employment there for a number of years.</P>

      <P>This Vote is for the maintenance and upkeep of the Haulbowline Dockyard which was transferred by the British Government to the Government of the Saorstát on the 21st March, 1923. The eastern portion of the island has been let to the contractors for the salvage of the ss.  Celtic until 31st July, 1931, with the right of an extension of the tenancy for a further year.  The lessees are liable for the maintenance of the property let to them.  The provisions in the Estimate for 1930-31 are only for the maintenance of the western portion of the island.  The total Vote is accordingly only £4,150, as compared with £12,100 last year&mdash;a decrease of £7,950, and compared with £19,500 in 1928-29, a decrease of £15,350.  There are decreases on all sub-heads of the Vote.  In sub-head A, Dockyard Maintenance, there is a total of £3,100 as against £9,000 last year. This contemplates the employment of a maintenance staff, a superintendent, a foreman, and about ten men, supplemented from time to time by casual labour for emergencies in <Col N="1595" /> such cases as storm repairs.  Sub-head B, Fuel, Light and Water, is reduced from £2,000 in 1929-30 to £650 in consequence of the letting of portion of the dockyard.  Sub-head C is for alterations to plant and buildings.  The provision of £400 is required to meet the cost of a secondhand motor boat which it is proposed to purchase for the purpose of the ferry service for transport of the Board's men and materials between Haulbowline and the mainland.  The present boat is not fit to travel with safety in rough weather.  I do not think there is anything further in this Vote to which I need refer. There has been a considerable reduction since last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred in previous years to the reductions in <Col N="1596" /> the Estimates which it had been found possible to effect in this service, and, as will be seen, it has been considered practicable to further reduce the amount required.  Although the decrease in the gross Estimate is approximately £18,000, the bulk of it represents reduced commitments in respect of charges under sub-head H for printing the registers of electors, etc., throughout the country, and as four-sevenths of this cost is repaid to the Stationery Office and credited to Appropriations-in-Aid, only a comparatively small saving in the net Estimate is secured.  I might add here that the decrease in sub-head H is due to the fact that for the coming year, and the three following years, the Stationery Office and local authorities would secure the benefit of reprint rates on the registers set up under five yearly contracts in 1929-30.</P>
      <P>Savings on sub-head J&mdash;that is, paper&mdash;amounting to £1,570, are due partly to the very favourable prices at which paper is now purchased and partly to a decline in the volume of paper required for public services. Under sub-heads F and G&mdash; that is, Oireachtas Printing, etc.&mdash; we have a reduction of £1,100.  This is partly the result of economies which have been effected in the cost of printing and binding of Oireachtas debates, and partly it is due to reduced provision for meeting the charges which should arise on reprinting and binding into volume form the statutory rules and orders issued since 1922.  The increases in sub-head A are mainly due to increments of salaries and wages.  Coming to sub-head B, I might inform Deputies that the addition here is to provide for the purchase of a new van in replacement of one now almost six years in use, whose further repair is deemed to be uneconomical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head GG provision has been made for the purpose of reprinting for advanced students and for University use certain text-books not now available in late, middle and early modern <Col N="1597" /> Irish.  A scheme will be drawn up with a view to selection of the most suitable books for the purpose.  Under sub-head HH the scheme for which £900 was provided in the Estimates for last year has been extended in scope.  The original intention was to revive certain weekly publications in Irish which, owing to financial difficulties, had ceased publication, and to assist others where it was shown, following investigation, that they were being carried on at a loss or were unable to establish themselves without assistance. Two publications have, as a result, been revived and one other has been assisted to keep going and enlarge its pages.  A fourth, a quarterly publication, is being published for the first time with the assistance given, and two other cases, one a revival of a children's newspaper, are under consideration.  The assistance takes the form of a grant, the extent of which is decided by a committee, towards the expenses of printing. This grant is paid by the Stationery Office on production of the printer's account and the voucher copies of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Part of the amount shown in this sub-head will, it is proposed, be used in the coming year for the payment to newspapers in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere for articles of local interest and reports of proceedings in Irish.  The object in view is to promote the extension of printing in the Irish language in areas where Irish is largely the speech of the people. Coming to sub-head L, dealing with binding, I would point out that the actual expenditure in the year ending 31st March last, on this sub-head, is approximately £8,300, or £300 in excess of the amount voted, and it is hoped that the estimated figure of £8,570 will be found sufficient to meet the binding charges falling in the present year.  Notwithstanding a reduction in the number of the more expensive bindings, the general binding charges tend to increase. This increase is due to the growth of new departments and the added activities of existing departments.</P>
    <P>The Stationery Office Estimates as a whole do not call for any very detailed <Col N="1598" /> analysis.  There has been, notwithstanding the progressive decline in expenditure, a considerable increase in printing and stationery services, partly arising out of additions to the services borne on the Stationery Office Vote and partly to the greater activities of existing services.  The deliberations of the Oireachtas in the past three years have resulted in the passing into law of approximately 120 Acts, and as these have included such important instruments as the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, the Land Act of 1927, the Betting Act, the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, the Barrow Drainage Act, and the Creamery Act, it will be evident that the additions to the Stationery Office services have been considerable. A heavy printing programme is also proposed by the Ancient MSS. Commission for completion in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that I am unable to point to any service of which the Stationery Office has been relieved in the same period, except the College of Science, which has passed to the National University, it is very satisfactory to note that considerable reductions have been effected with the co-operation of Departments in the matter of official requirements.  These reductions have been not alone in the volume of stores supplies but also in the form and style of printing and binding. There have also been savings in production costs largely due to closer competition for Stationery Office purchases, the stencilling by the Stationery Office staff in lieu of printing of important documents such as minutes of evidence taken before Commissions, always a costly printing work, and of documents for internal use, of which limited quantities are needed.  The general effect of these savings has been to more than neutralise the cost of additional services cast on the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>No statement from this Department would be complete that overlooked the important services carried out by it on a repayment basis. The cost of printing, binding and <Col N="1599" /> special supplies for such new services as the Currency Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board; the printing, binding and publication of text-books under Vote 47, the publications in Irish, under Vote 49 and of the older repaying services, including payment for the insertion of all Government advertisements in the Press, it is estimated will exceed £20,000 in the coming year.  To this amount should be added the Estimate of £2,250 referred to in the Appropriations-in-Aid, being the value of stock issues to repaying Departments. For these services the Stationery Office, it is estimated, will receive £1,600 as Appropriations-in-Aid as commission for Staff charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is the Department that deals with the question of the allocation of Government advertisements to newspapers throughout the country. On last year's Estimate I drew the attention of the House to the boycott of a certain newspaper, as far as Government advertisements were concerned, because editorially it did not see eye to eye with the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The paper had the courage to criticise the Minister for Finance, with the result that no Government advertisement is given to that newspaper.  I want to make it clear that I am not here to make a plea on behalf of that newspaper in order to get Government advertisements for it.  That paper is in the position that it can carry on very successfully without Government advertisements.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the corrupt practice, if I might say so, that has been adopted, not by the Parliamentary Secretary, but by the Minister for Finance in regard to this question of Government advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised the matter in the House last year the Minister informed me that it would in future be the policy of the Government not to advertise in newspapers which <Col N="1600" /> were edited and printed outside the Saorstát.  During the past year the Government advertisements have appeared in at least two Belfast papers, notwithstanding that promise made by the Minister.  Six or eight months ago a dwelling in Buncrana, Co. Donegal, owned or controlled by the Board of Works, became vacant.  Instead of advertising it in the newspaper which circulates extensively in that district the Government inserted the advertisement of the letting in two Belfast newspapers. So much for the statement made, or the face-saving excuse put up by the Minister for Finance in regard to the boycott of the newspaper which I have mentioned.  No doubt the Minister's policy is to withhold Government advertisements from newspapers whose editors refuse to shout through Cumann na nGaedheal megaphones. I say it is tantamount to using the taxpayers' money for Party purposes in order to bolster up the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  These tactics should not be tolerated by this House.  Government advertisements should not be looked upon as the gift of any Government, no matter what Party is in power.  Because a newspaper has the courage of its convictions to state things clearly and distinctly, and even if it should be criticising the Minister for Finance, it is not fair that it should be treated in the manner I have indicated. This House should not silently acquiesce in such a policy. For that reason, I intend to vote against this Estimate.  I will protest in that way against the mean, petty policy enunciated by the Minister for Finance in trying to victimise his political opponents through the medium of Government funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate shows an increase of £44,697 upon that for the previous year. This increase is mainly attributable <Col N="1603" /> to increases in sub-heads A and B and to a decrease in the estimated amount of the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.  The increase in sub-head A is due to two causes, one of which is the automatic increments in the scale of pay, and these increments are increments which we must expect to go on from year to year, because the Guards, starting as young men at a minimum salary, have not yet, in the majority of instances, reached the maximum pay of their rank.  The second cause of this increase was the fact that provision has to be made this year for fifty-three weeks' pay for sergeants and Guards serving outside Dublin because, as Deputies are aware, certain years have fifty-three Saturdays.  This year is one of such years, and in consequence the present Estimate shows a week's more money for salaries and allowances than last year or than next year will show.</P>
      <P>Increments on the existing scale involve an increase approximately of £25,000 and the extra week's pay which will fall due involves an extra charge of about £22,000.  On the other hand, a substantial saving will be effected owing to the fact that a number of vacancies have arisen, owing to retirements and dismissals, and have not been filled.  During 1929 recruiting was suspended and the strength has now fallen, through normal wastage, to approximately 7,000 men of all ranks.  That is the strength for which provision is made in the Estimate, and the reduction of £9,825 is being taken on the assumption that not all of those vacancies will be filled during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head B shows an increase of £11,747, which is mainly due to the increased number of men who will be entitled to rent allowance during the coming year.  The remaining sub-heads show little variation and such variations as there are, are mainly a decrease on the figures of last year. The sum of £500 in sub-head P is a grant towards expenses of a scheme which has been approved for developing the use of the Irish language in the Guards.  This involves <Col N="1604" /> the transfer of numbers of men from time to time to Gaeltacht stations where facilities are available for speaking Irish.  It also involves provision for linguaphone outfits for all stations.  It is estimated that the cost of gramophone and linguaphone records will be £2,500.  It has been decided to make a grant in aid of £500.  The remainder of the cost, that is approximately £2,000, will be borne by members of the force themselves. Deputies opposite will, I am sure, easily recognise that if the Guards have a linguaphone and Irish records their ears will be accustomed to Irish sounds and they will make a certain amount of progress so that when they are moved to stations in the Gaeltacht, as it is hoped they all in rotation will be they will have a fair knowledge of Irish on which to build.  That is much better than sending them to stations in the Gaeltacht without having any previous knowledge of spoken Irish.</P>
    <P>The estimated amount to be received as appropriation-in-aid shows a decrease of £4,933.  That is due to the fact that the police rate for the coming year will be threepence in the pound as against fourpence for the past year.  This reduction involves a loss to the sub-head of £6,500.  A reduction of the police rate is provided for in the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.  The rate stood originally at eightpence and it is being reduced by one penny each year so that it will finally disappear in three years' time.  None of the other sub-heads, I think, calls for any special remarks, but during the past few months twenty-four Gárda stations have been closed permanently and nine have been closed temporarily pending the provision of suitable barrack accommodation. Those nine stations are stations which must as a permanent measure be kept open.  The Board of Works has not found it possible to keep the supply of barrack accommodation up to the actual necessary requirements of the Gárda and, in consequence, since those nine barracks were unsanitary and a danger to the health of the men stationed there, it was found necessary to close them.  New <Col N="1605" /> barracks will, however, be erected in course of time in their place and will be opened.  So far as the twenty-four Gárda stations which have been permanently closed are concerned, I want to say that it is the belief of the authorities in charge of the Guards that these stations can be closed and at the same time that the policing of the country can be satisfactorily carried out.  I have received complaints from practically every district in which a barrack has been closed and I have received many deputations and many representations from persons living in the neighbourhood of almost all these barracks requesting that they should be kept open and stating their views, as residents in the locality, that they did not think that they could receive from the law the protection which they, as citizens of the Saorstát, are entitled to receive if these respective stations were closed.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that it is the duty of the Government, indeed it is the main and primary duty of this, as of every other, Government, to afford full protection in person and property to citizens of the State and also to see that the law in this country is effectively and properly administered.  While we believe that that can be done, in spite of the fact that these stations have been closed, if we find that our calculations are wrong and that there is an outbreak of crime, whether petty or serious crime, in the neighbourhood of any of these closed stations and that they cannot be effectively policed from other stations we will re-open any such stations in districts where we find that that condition of affairs exists.  I say that because, as I have already remarked to the House, very strong representations have been made to me from almost all quarters and a very real disquiet seems to exist in the various neighbourhoods. I am anxious to dispel such feeling of disquietude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I think that everybody who is concerned with or interested in, the burden of taxation imposed on this country will regard this Estimate as very disappointing.  When last year's Estimate was being considered it was suggested from this side of the House that, if the Minister was really anxious to try and reduce the burden which this Estimate imposes, he would have set up a committee of inquiry to inquire into the various duties of the Guards and to see what reductions could be made.  It was represented to the Minister at the time that the force was redundant and that there was a large number of stations that could be closed down. So far as I can recollect the Minister at the time more or less put on one side, or at any rate was not disposed to give that matter the consideration that one would give it who was interested in bringing the police forces down to a normal strength&mdash;a strength that was necessary for the country and not a strength that we say is entirely out of proportion to what the people can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister at that time stated that he proposed to stop recruiting and as a result of that we had hoped that there would be a substantial reduction in the Estimate this year. Looking at the Estimate, we find that for this part of the country about £2,000,000 has to be provided to maintain a police force.  It is not all embodied in this Estimate but it comes from sources that are provided by the taxpayers.  It does not matter therefore under what head the various amounts are provided.  The people of this country have been continually complaining that it has been over-policed.  The Minister is living up to the reputation which the country has had for being over-policed and the economies which he indicated last year have not borne much fruit.  We have a net increase this year of £44,000 on last year's Estimate.  It is true that salaries, wages and increments account for about £30,000 and allowances £11,707. Of course if the Minister was genuinely anxious or made a real effort to bring down the cost of the <Col N="1607" /> Guards to reasonable proportions, to proportions which would not impose the crushing burden of taxation on the people that it is now proposed to inflict on them, he would have effected economies in various ways, by having more retirements from the Guards and by setting up a committee to inquire into the ways and means by which they could recommend to him certain lines of reduction and economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister more or less made the case this evening that though they had closed down 24 stations it was a step in the dark.  Now we have had a report from the Gárda authorities that they could be quite safely closed down.  If the Minister went to the trouble of having this matter more carefully and fully gone into, he would not be confined to 24 barracks; he would be able to close many more.  We would like to know what is the policy of the Minister for the coming year, whether he proposes to have any investigation carried out or to take any further steps to ascertain how many more stations can be closed.  If economies along that line were effected, it is not only possible but probable that the Estimate we are asked to vote to-night would be very much smaller than it is.  The increments in wages and salaries and the increased allowances are no justification for the Minister coming along here this year with an increased estimate.  If the Minister had endeavoured to effect economies in the force he would have been in a position to bring it down to a much lower figure than it was last year.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude with regard to discontinuing recruiting.  The Minister is satisfied apparently that there are too many Guards.  He was satisfied as to that last year because, if he were not satisfied of that, he would have filled any positions that became vacant through retirements, dismissals or otherwise.  If the Minister is satisfied of that fact and satisfied that he is not going to recruit in future, that he is not going to fill the positions which have been vacated by retirements <Col N="1608" /> or dismissals, then the Minister is satisfied that there are too many Guards.  The Minister shakes his head.  What does it mean?  If there are not too many Guards why does not the Minister fill the positions which became vacant during the year?  The Minister does not fill them of course because he is satisfied that there is no necessity to fill them. The only explanation that one can supply as to the Minister's attitude is that he does not want to deprive those men of positions.  The Minister has a method of dealing with positions which are redundant and for which no necessity exists.  Does he think that no employment can be provided for men who retire from the Civic Guards?  Does he think that there is no employment in the country?  Is he convinced, as a result of the economic policy pursued in this country, that that is so, or is he convinced that men who have served in the Guards will be so useless when they leave the force that they can get no employment?  There must be one or other of those explanations for the Minister's attitude.</P>
    <P>It is not much consolation to the taxpayer who knows, as the Minister and the Government know, that he has too many Guards, that he could do with less and that at the same time he takes no steps to reduce the force, except to see that when there are dismissals and retirements the positions so vacated are not filled. There is one item in the Estimate for which the Minister has not given any explanation.  That is the allowance for casual expenses for those engaged on detective duty.  This year the item is £6,242; last year it was £4,000.  One would expect some explanation of that.  What is the reason for it and what peculiar circumstances have arisen now to necessitate that expenditure?  There is a further item for members employed on duty in plain clothes, which shows an increase of practically £1,000.  That is an item on which I would like to get some explanation. Does the Minister propose to close down other stations? Can he give the House any indication of the number of those <Col N="1609" /> stations?  Can he give the House the number of expected retirements or dismissals during the coming year? Supposing there are 500 retirements or dismissals during the coming year, is not the Minister satisfied that the force is of sufficient strength minus these 500 men?  If the Minister is satisfied of that, why does he not take steps to relieve the people of portion of this burden which is inflicted on them?</P>
    <P>Another matter is that you have ex-R.I.C. men in the force who at some future time will be drawing double pensions from the State.  The Minister admitted that last year on this Estimate.  That is a position that should not be permitted.  If the Minister is desirous of effecting economy, he has a very ready and easy way of doing it.  Being now convinced that he could have done last year with fewer Guards than he has, and that he could do with fewer for the coming year, is it not time that he should get some committee together to investigate the whole position with a view to being definitely advised as to what the strength should be and what alterations should be made in the force in order to effect some reasonable and proper economy?</P>
    <P>Other matters that arise on this estimate have been discussed already.  One of them was referred to by me when the Minister was being nominated a few weeks ago&mdash; that is, the attitude of the Department where complaints have been made as to the action of certain Guards in various parts of the country.  I do not want the Minister to misconstrue our attitude in any way when we bring before the House flagrant and glaring cases by saying that we are trying to attack the Guards as a body.  In the opinion of decent and high-minded persons, cases of blackguardism have undoubtedly occurred, and certain acts have been committed by the Guards, and the Minister has continually put himself in the position of accepting the word of the Guards absolutely and disregarding evidence given or affidavits produced by respectable <Col N="1610" /> members of the community.  We have even had cases where public bodies have sent resolutions to the Minister asking for a public inquiry, which he has declined to give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would. I want to know from the Minister what is the position with regard to those Guards who have been decreed? Who is going to pay the decrees given for illegal acts committed by them in the City of Dublin and elsewhere?  Is the Minister going to ask the taxpayers to pay for what he himself, through his Guards, has been responsible for when they committed illegalities with the encouragement of the Minister, because every time any question with regard to them has been raised here the Minister has repeatedly and deliberately, parrot-like, stood up to defend them without any proper investigation.  He just accepted their word; of course, I suppose, in the name of law and order.  But it is a rather peculiar interpretation of law and order to encourage members of the force to commit illegalities.  The House would like to get an indication as to who is going to provide the money to pay for these illegalities.</P>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back, because economies can be effected which the Minister, if he would take the trouble, could very easily have effected by having this matter of police work investigated and a report submitted to him.  I think the people, seeing the number of Guards in the country and the very small amount of duty they have to perform in many country districts, in any case, must regard the number of Guards as absolutely redundant and unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Criticism of this Estimate divides itself into two parts; criticism of the general policy of the Department and criticism of what might be called matters of detail.  In the second matter, the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party might be considered <Col N="1611" /> to be analogous to those industries which are trying to achieve rationalisation.  We want to see the forces of law and order rationalised. In fact, by playing upon the word, it covers both my points.  From the point of view of general policy, the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal administration seems to be to regard the Gárda as the lynch-pin of their Party.  So long as the Guards can be got to think that they would be in a position of insecurity under a change of administration, apparently the Government are satisfied.  But, if a change of opinion came amongst the Guards, if those amongst them who are earnest and conscientious, could consider themselves as safe in their position, then their minds would be free from the necessity of considering political issues and the Cumann na nGaedheal administration would consider their own position very dangerous; what they regard as their instrument would be lost to them.  It would be of enormous value to the country if we could get the Cumann na nGaedheal administration to give up that idea entirely.  I know it would require a tremendous effort on their part to do it but it would be greatly in the interests of the country.  It would be very fair to the Civic Guards; it would put them in quite a different position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has evidence of that attitude of mind in the speech made by the Minister for Finance on the 6th April in Monaghan.  In that speech he referred to the Fianna Fáil Party and said that &ldquo;if the Fianna Fáil Party were in power for a month army officers would be discharged and zealous and conscientious Civic Guards would be dismissed.&rdquo;  That is an indication of the attitude of mind of the Cumann na nGaedheal administration towards the Civic Guards. They want to frighten the people into a sense of insecurity if there was a change of administration, and at the same time they want to frighten the Guards into feeling that as the Fianna Fáil Party gains power in the country so every man's hand will be against the Guards. <Col N="1612" /> That position is about as unhealthy a one as you could create in any country.</P>
    <P>At the present time the people feel very little else except the emptiness of their pockets, and they are not prepared to regard the expenditure at present upon the Guards as the sole source of their security, because in their present economic condition they are indifferent as to what persons like the Minister for Finance has to say about Fianna Fáil and the Guards.  And that attitude of mind is particularly dangerous because it gives evilly-minded persons in the State encouragement; it makes them think that possibly if there were a change of administration, they might get an opportunity of creating anarchy where the party coming into power was supposed to be in sympathy with anarchy.  It is thoroughly inconsistent with other statements made by members of the Ministry, because in a more recent speech the Minister for Finance claims and boasts that he and his Government have brought the country back to peace and to normal conditions.  If he makes that boast he should live up to it.  He should take up the attitude that would be taken up in any normal country, where a change of Government becomes a normal part of the life of the people.  Everybody realises that a change of Government is fairly imminent.  This is the oldest Government in Europe and taking this country as a normal country a change of Government would become obvious.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is a proper or right thing for the Ministry to be using this force for political purposes, and inspiring members of this force with political prejudice against the largest political party in the State.  As indicating the attitude of the people generally and their assertion of commonsense it is worth our while to look at the results of certain actions that were <Col N="1613" /> taken against certain detective guards in the city of Dublin.  I shall take four cases which occurred and the results of which were published in the Press.</P>
      <P>There was a case of Donal O'Donoghue who took proceedings against Detective Officer Rogers for having been arrested, searched, detained and assaulted.  He got damages from a judge and jury amounting to £50.  In the course of that case certain things were stated to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  It appears that Superintendent Ennis remarked afterwards to Mr. O'Donoghue that he did not know he was in prison. It, also, came out in the evidence that Detective Officer Rogers had not told the station sergeant what was the charge, and, further, in cross-examination, he refused the name of the person who gave him information against O'Donoghue.  The other detective officer, who was with Rogers at the time, was not proceeded against, and he was not called as a witness.  I would like to know from the Minister what disciplinary action he took in this particular case.  Obviously when a judge and jury bring in a verdict like that, the officers have exceeded their powers, they have been excessive in their zeal, and some disciplinary action should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, no matter how heinous the crime is, no matter how necessary it is to detect that crime, at the same time, the procedure must not be of such a kind as to become a danger to ordinary citizens in the community.  If an ambulance has to go out in an urgent case of accident, no matter how urgent that case is, the driver of the ambulance is not allowed to run over people and to maim them or to kill them.  He has to take ordinary precautions which will protect society and the individual. So, too, there must be some limit, some control of those forces which are there to carry out certain onerous duties that are difficult to carry out.  The counsel defending the detective in this case tried to press home the point that Mr. <Col N="1614" /> O'Donoghue and others were members of the I.R.A., but the jury and the judge paid secondary consideration to those matters.  Their common sense asserted itself against a sort of feeling of panic and over-zeal, apparently, that was existing, and generally they reflected public opinion in the matter that the force had gone too far.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I think O'Donoghue was arrested six times.  The other persons who took actions were John Sugrue, who was awarded damages amounting to £40; Charles O'Neill, who was awarded damages amounting to £80; and Patrick McKee, who got damages amounting to £75.  One of these men was asked if he recognised the court, and he said he recognised the court to the extent of its being a necessary operation in the country, but that he was a Republican and had strong Republican views.  He recognised the court very much in the spirit laid down in that famous letter&mdash;he did not say this, but it occurred to me on reading his evidence&mdash;of Cardinal Mercier when the Germans were in occupation of Belgium when he told the people that they should recognise the courts for necessary purposes; and that appeared to be the attitude taken up by this man.</P>
    <P>Although that was the attitude, the jury seemed to take a thoroughly sane view of his evidence and they did not allow themselves in any way to be influenced by the political opinions of that particular individual. Really the Minister should thank God for the Sinn Féiners because if they did recognise the court in cases where they do not recognise the court they could take action after action.  Thousands of actions could be taken against his Department and awards given upon exactly the same lines as these have been given.  In fact, if they were to adopt that policy and to have recourse to the Courts on the principles I mentioned they could do very much more effective <Col N="1615" /> work in bringing the Department of the Guards as administered by the Minister for Justice very much more quickly to a sense, shall we say, of normality.  It is very little use for us getting up in the House and repeating time after time the delinquencies of the Minister as represented by the actions of his Guards because it simply means the same thing is repeated time after time. We are as much interested in the Guards as the Minister is.  The Minister laughs but I can assure him that we speak with sincerity.  We regard it as absolutely necessary to have certain forces of law and order in this country but we also think that force should, as well as politically also economically, be rationalised.  It would be impossible to make suggestions how it should be done from the Opposition benches because we have not got the material before us.  Anyone who had any experience on the Courts of Justice Committee would realise that the amount of statistics and details required to make any changes in the organisation is such that it would be impossible for us to suggest how the Guards should be reduced or how their work should be changed.  One would require to have the programme of the day's work of the typical Guard or the week's work or the month's work and the various work done by the superintendents and other officers.</P>
    <P>Unless some such inquiry were made it would be impossible to make any suggestion, but I think if an inquiry is entered into it should include some scheme whereby these men can be carried over into some industry or occupation suitable to their training.  Even the Guards' barracks mentioned by the Minister as having been closed down, I suppose, like the empty unions, will be allowed to go to wreck and ruin. Surely the Minister should exercise his ingenuity, get in touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and see that these empty Guards' barracks be turned to some useful local purpose.  While the Minister <Col N="1616" /> will not recognise the necessity of using rationalisation in the case of the organisation of the Guards his Ministry are all in favour of rationalising the industries outside this country which are affecting industries such as the milling industry in this country.  Now, I think that the Government which thinks upon the lines of rationalisation at least in an acquiescent way in one case should be prepared to adopt the same attitude in the other case.</P>
    <P>In the debate last year it was suggested that on account of the increased facilities of transport, telephones, and so on, that one could dispense with a certain number of the police force.  One cannot dogmatise on that.  The Minister offered an answer, and I am sure in some places that answer would hold good, but in a great many places more reliance could be put on methods of transport to bring officers around, and in that way actually reduce the cost. But at the same time, while doing so upon sane lines, it should not justify such an expenditure as occurs under sub-head D, where, in the Public Accounts Committee, it was mentioned that 126 officers were responsible for the spending of £18,000 per annum on locomotion expenses.  The mileage rate is 6d.  If you calculate that out you will find that it will constitute a single journey of about thirty times around the world, or it would allow for each of these 126 officers to go on a journey about as far as Persia.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has a close check upon the duties carried out on those journeys, and whether he will give the House some idea of why it is that that particular item should be so high and why superintendents should have to travel so much.</P>
    <P>Thirteen thousand pounds is spent annually upon cycling allowances at the rate of £2 10s. per head.  I would like to know from the Minister whether all the bicycles now being purchased for the Guards are of Irish make.  There are excellent Irish bicycles, quite up to anything that can be imported.  I mentioned <Col N="1617" /> this matter and drew the Minister's attention to it before, and I would like to get an answer from him in reference to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge pointed out the increase under sub-head B in reference to the detective forces.  The total increase is something over £3,000.  On sub-head H there is an increase from £1,000 to £1,300.  The significance, although it is a small increase, is that it is also an increase in the transport of the detective branch outside the Dublin metropolitan area.  I do not know why all this increase should have taken place in the Department.  I do not know whether it is the result of the recent sudden menace of a change of Government or not that we saw Ministers and others with an enormous number of Civic Guards surrounding them.  Perhaps some of us have too strong a sense of humour and not a sufficient sense of the possibilities of the situation, but really the increase in the number of guards for these people seems to be altogether out of proportion to the results; certainly we do not grudge them all the protection they can get.</P>

      <P>I would like to see the Minister co-operating with the Fianna Fáil Party in trying to create greater respect for the law in this country, because really we are anxious that the law should be reverenced.  At a meeting recently I made remarks something on these lines.  I pointed out that we wanted to see a police force in Ireland which would be looked up to as the upholders of the law made by the people and reverenced by the people, an absolutely impartial force.  After the meeting was over a man came up to me who had suffered very severely at the hands of these forces, within quite recent years, too, a man who had been severely beaten and tortured not so long ago.  I said to him: &ldquo;What do you think of what I said?&rdquo; He is a friend of mine.  He said he agreed thoroughly with everything I said.  I mention that here because it shows that the men of right spirit, no matter how strong their views are as Republicans, want to see this country with a high respect for the laws of the country, and it is not merely platform talk when we say these things on public platforms.  It really represents the views of the men who have been most devoted to the Irish Republic and have suffered most for it.  There were a few details also mentioned in the Public Accounts Committee which I would like to ask questions about.  There was the case of two R.I.C. men.  One of them at any rate was an accountant clerk and so he was receiving his pension and his salary at the same time.</P>

      <P>There are two points&mdash;first that it is the practice, though not always followed, that there should be a discussion on the report of the Public Accounts Committee; and secondly, that the report of the Public Accounts Committee is always published too late to be relevant to the Estimates under discussion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point of order.  Are we to understand that any reference to the Committee of Public Accounts and their work in connection with the Civic Guard Departments would be out of order in this discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Public Accounts Committee is generally discussed as a separate thing in itself rather than discussed on the Estimates.  That has always been the practice, and the reports of the Public Accounts Committee which have been published and could be quoted from would not be relevant to anything that has happened since April, 1929, and would therefore, for that reason, not be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the items in this Estimate is an estimate for the transport of officers, and I submit that it would be in order to refer to the investigations which this Committee made with regard to the cost of transport of officers, for example. It ought to be in order, I submit, for a Deputy, while discussing this question, to refer to the recommendations or discussions of the Committee of Public Accounts on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It might <Col N="1620" /> possibly be, but the general question of using the Public Accounts Committee report on the Estimates is one that has to be dealt with rather carefully.  While certain things might be relevant, as Deputy Little just pointed out, when referring to a continuing problem, still the general idea of using the Public Accounts Committee is not particularly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That also raises a question which I think ought to be taken into consideration.  If members are expected to criticise these Estimates, in what other way can they get information as to the way in which the money is being spent? The only other source they have is the Appropriation Accounts, which are also out of date, because it can be argued that since they are two years' old they are not relevant to the Estimates under discussion.  I think the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts is the only place where we can get information as to the details of the expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make the matter clear.  I had it in the back of my mind that I was not going to raise anything from the Public Accounts Committee which had ceased to have a bearing on the present administration.  Another question arising out of that which I would like to ask the Minister is whether in the course of this year it has been possible to do anything in reference to tracing the superintendent who absconded with a sum of £199 and as to what powers he has for dealing with people outside Saorstát Eireann in tracing persons who get away with money like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> There is one item in the Estimates under sub-head O&mdash;Food for Prisoners in the Bridewell&mdash;which I would like to refer to.  I have always heard from those who have gone there, and some people are taken there very constantly, that there is no food, or very little food, to be had, and that it has to be supplied from outside.  The Estimate would bear that out.  The cost was £90 during the year 1929-30 and the Minister has made a saving on that this year.  He has reduced it to £40 next year.  God help the prisoners in the Bridewell.  It is really scandalous. It is a place of detention, not a place of punishment, where persons are taken and detained and they should, at least, be given sufficient food to prevent their health being impaired. They should at least get enough normal food.  I do not know&mdash;perhaps the Minister has made up his mind that everyone who goes into the Bridewell is guilty until he is released and on that account that it is going to be turned into a kind of starvation penitentiary.  We have let down the Minister very lightly this year considering that there have been at least between thirty-five and forty cases mentioned in the House in which allegations were made against the Guards in different parts of the country.  But we want the Minister to try to get back a little commonsense, to try to regard his forces as non-political forces, because it would be infinitely better for the state of the whole country if the Guards could be regarded as being absolutely neutral, and as persons who, like Cæsar's wife, were above suspicion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Sheehy Mr. Sheehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>(West Cork): I rise to support the Minister's motion.  The Guards have now been in existence for over eight years and they have won for themselves the admiration, the respect, and the esteem of every class in the community.  From one end of the Saorstát to the other the Guards are respected, and as an instance of that respect, at this moment if the Minister asked for 10,000 respectable young Irishmen to join the Guards he would have them in less than twenty-four hours.  That <Col N="1622" /> is surely a token that as far as the general body of the people are concerned they are fully satisfied with the Guards.  I was very pained by Deputy Little's opening remarks. He certainly slandered the Guards, slandered the Executive, and slandered my colleagues on this side of the House.  We wanted no partisanship when we went into the elections. We fought them perfectly impartially. The Guards did their duty as a capable and conscientious body of men.  I defy any member of this House to prove that the Guards lined up in the elections with any class&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going back to the elections because the Guards, who are now in the scale, have been maligned by Deputy Little.  They are a conscientious, solid body of men who are prepared to stand by their oaths, and who are standing by them, and many of the electors would not sleep easily in their beds if the Minister were to reduce the Guards further.  When it was proposed to withdraw the Guards from Castletownshend, an important town in connection with the southern fisheries, there was a large memorial sent in, signed by every section of the community, asking that they should be allowed to remain. The Minister gave it his careful consideration, but as a result of the economy policy and the pressure of those heroes across the way he had to close twenty-four barracks against the wishes of the people, who would be perfectly satisfied to pay the money in order to preserve the good name and the morality of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word on this matter, arising out of the speeches which were made by the mover and the seconder of the motion that the Estimate be referred back.  I listened very carefully to them, because I was particularly anxious to hear the case that would be made for referring this Estimate <Col N="1623" /> back.  Deputy Little made certain references to the sense of insecurity that exists among the Guards at the prospect of a change of Government, and to a certain extent I agree with him.  To a certain extent I agree with him, too, that that feeling was &mdash;I will not go so far as to say is&mdash; fostered, certainly at the time of the 1927 election.  I hope I am not going back too far, but I want to make this point, that undoubtedly that sense of insecurity at the prospect of a change was fostered.  But I do feel &mdash;and I agree with Deputy Little entirely in this&mdash;that there should be no such sense of insecurity among the Guards, or among any other body of public servants, at the idea of a change of administration.  That should be a normal condition of affairs, and no matter who our public servants are&mdash;civil servants, army or police&mdash;there should be no sense of insecurity among them as a body at the idea of a change in the administration, but they should regard it as their duty to serve faithfully and well any body of men who would be charged with the government of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But if that sense of insecurity is there, I would ask Deputy Little and his colleagues what have they done and what are they doing to remove it?  I honestly do not think that they are going the right way to remove it.  I will not refer to the various things that have happened from time to time, but I did think, from a statement that I saw recently, that a step had been taken in the right direction when one of their leaders&mdash;I think it was Deputy Lemass but I am not quite sure&mdash; stated at a public meeting that there would be no question of dismissal or of interference with members of the Gárda Síochána if and when his Party came into power.  I regarded that as a sensible statement.  But I listened to Deputy Ruttledge to night and as far as I could gather&mdash;because I will not refer now to the things that Deputy Little went into, and that Deputy Ruttledge went into to some extent, which are more proper to the Vote for the Office of the <Col N="1624" /> Minister for Justice&mdash;Deputy Ruttledge's only case was that economies should be effected in this Vote, and the way in which these economies should be effected was by some means or other to get rid of redundant members of the Gárda Síochána That statement is not calculated to bring about the sense of security which Deputy Little and I would like to see among the Guards in face of a possible change in the administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge made the case that in fact we are over policed, that there are too many Guards.  But assuming for a moment that that is the case, he was not satisfied that that problem could not be dealt with merely by the stoppage of recruiting and the non-filling of vacancies when they occurred.  He pointed out that there should be some way of getting rid of them.  Even Deputy Little followed Deputy Ruttledge in that when he said that there ought to be some way of getting members of the Guards into industries.  I submit that you will not create a sense of security in the Gárda Síochána by suggestions of that kind, because members of the Gárda Síochána will perhaps take it that if another Government came into power they would propose a drastic reduction, or a transference to some form of industry to which the Guards would not be particularly anxious to be transferred.</P>
    <P>I make that criticism because I feel with Fianna Fáil Deputies that it is not good and not well for the country that there should be any idea amongst public servants that it would be necessary for them to do things in order to maintain one particular set of people in charge of the administration, and that it is, in fact, wrong that they should do such things.  I am not satisfied that we could not get more service from the Gárda Síochána.  I am not satisfied that we are over-policed, although I think in small rural areas four, or even three, members of the Gárda Síochána are scarcely necessary.  However, that is a matter on which I would require <Col N="1625" /> much more evidence before I would be satisfied that we are over-policed. My approach to the matter would be rather that we should charge the police with other forms of duty.  In some things at least there is too much temptation on the part of policemen&mdash;possibly because they may not have more important work to do&mdash;to pick up little trespass cases and cases dealing with lights on bicycles&mdash;not that it is not necessary to look after these matters, but law and order might be well maintained by efficient policemen who would very often look with a blind eye on some of the petty cases that are brought into the District Court regularly.  That would be my approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>I quite recognise that of late we have put on the Guards duties that the R.I.C. were never asked to do. There is the important work of the enforcement of school attendance and other duties in connection with statistics and questions of that kind. I believe that their services should be employed, and can be employed, in that direction, perhaps, even to a greater extent than is the case at present.  I listened carefully to the debate, and I do not see that any case has been made to warrant referring back this Vote in the circumstances in which it was proposed, and I do not propose to vote for the motion.</P>

      <P>I think the Opposition Party are to be complimented on the exceedingly mild character of the speeches that were made when compared with similar speeches on previous occasions.  It is a good, healthy sign, and one which I feel sure will further increase the confidence which this country is enjoying.  The Guards perform a service for which the people are quite satisfied to pay, and the Minister was quite correct when he stated that when a suggestion is made in a country district to close down a station there is always uneasiness and anxiety amongst the people there, and petitions are signed and deputations sent up requesting reconsideration of the matter.  The Guards are a body of <Col N="1626" /> men who enjoy the full confidence of the vast majority of the people, and no case whatever has been made for referring this Vote back, and I feel sure it will be passed by a very large majority.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy O'Connell raised the point he raised with regard to the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the Garda Síochána in general and on the question of administration with regard to the Gárda, and particularly their numbers. I would like to back up what Deputy Little said with regard to our attitude towards law and order, so far as the Gárda Síochána is concerned. We would do anything we could, and we are prepared at all times to do whatever lies in our power, to secure proper and due respect for law and order.  We have always stood for that.  But what we have protested against, and what we will continue to protest against is the misuse of the police force for political purposes.  I do not want to go into the past.  I do not want to go into the question of excitements at election times, because perhaps things will happen then that even the Minister for Justice&mdash;and he can stand a good deal&mdash;might not be able to stand for.  We realise fully that out of the origins of that force, considering its history, considering the time it was formed, and the state of mind of the people who formed it, as well as of those brought into it, there is bound to be a certain amount of political prejudice.  We cannot get over the fact that a very great number of men concerned, as well as the Ministry that formed it, are bound to have strong prejudices against people who were, as strongly as they could be, against the formation of the Free State, as well as the formation of the Gárda Síochána at the time.  That was our attitude. Some of us did our best to prevent the Free State coming into existence. We do not regret doing so, but we did not succeed; the Free State came into existence, and also the Gárda Síochána, but the prejudices that were there have not all evaporated&mdash; not by any means&mdash;and they have <Col N="1627" /> not evaporated on our side any more than on the other side.  I like to be frank and candid in what I say, and I repeat that we are anxious for the growth of respect for law and order, and the institutions of law and order.  We realise, as I heard Deputy Little say more than once, that if there was a free and independent Republic in this country we would have to have a police force, and we would have to encourage the people to respect that police force and to carry out the law.  I do not want to go into the cases that Deputy Little referred to, but we know that there is not on the other side that mentality that would assist us to encourage people to have proper respect for law and order.  We do not get that help, but we are certainly anxious to do what we can to promote respect for real law, and respect for a real Constitution that the people would accept.  But leaving politics out of the question, I think we are over-policed.  I am satisfied of that from my own observations and from my knowledge, such as it is, of other countries.  I lived in other countries for fairly long periods.  I lived in England for my sins at one time for a period of six months.  I was sent there, and lived in a country village in which there was one policeman for a radius of 20 or 25 miles, and in the next village, about 20 miles away, there were two policemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to come in contact with police in rural parts of England, because I, with a number of others, some of whom are not politically associated with me now, used to have to report to them.  We got to know a good deal about their system there from discussions that we used to have with the heads of the county police.  The rural areas in England in which I and others spent six months was not any more law-abiding than any typical rural area that one might take in Ireland. In any of the villages in these rural areas in England, except the one chosen to be the headquarters of the local sergeant, you have not more <Col N="1628" /> than one constable.  In view of modern methods of transport and communication, we think that you could do very well with a similar number of police in rural areas in Ireland.  In thickly-populated rural areas you might perhaps have a larger number of police, but to say that it is necessary to expend on police in this State almost two millions of money annually, almost one-tenth of the total taxation of the country, is preposterous.</P>
    <P>We think that amount could be very considerably reduced with great advantage to the country as well as with advantage to the men themselves.  It must have a bad effect on the morale of the men themselves when you see, as I have seen, in small villages in this country&mdash; sometimes in very tiny villages&mdash;a sergeant and four or five men with nothing to do, simply lolling about the roads and lying about the ditches half their time.  I am sure those in authority over them try to find work for them to do, but the fact is that there is not enough work for these men.  I am afraid that oftentimes they do not fill in their time with advantage to themselves.  I know that a number of Deputies have stated that in a few cases where the Gárda Síochána barracks were closed recently appeals have been made to the Minister to re-open them.  I think a similar situation used to arise in the times depicted in &ldquo;The Eloquent Dempsey.&rdquo;  The Gárdaí are in some cases&mdash;I do not want to say that this is typical of the Guards generally&mdash;very good customers of certain shops, say, provision shops. They certainly are good customers, and naturally the shopkeeper does not want to lose their custom.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that in one case at least that I <Col N="1629" /> know of where an appeal was made for the reopening of a barracks the appeal was not inspired by the farmers.  The reason given to me was that the person who inspired the appeal was a shopkeeper, and that the closing down of the barracks mcant a loss of £200 a year to him. We think that a number of these Gárda barracks could be closed down.  So far as the Gárdaí themselves are concerned, we are not out to victimise individuals.  Taking them as a whole, we have no fault to find with the ordinary uniformed Guard who does his duty as a Guard and carries out the law in a law-abiding way.  Our grievances, and they have been frequently expressed here, have been against the ununiformed men, and even as far as these men are concerned, I think our grievance is more against the Minister and the Government than against individuals, although individuals have frequently broken the law, as the Minister knows by now as a result of certain cases that have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think that there should be a reduction in the number of Guards. We thin that there is too much money spent on the police force.  I would not like to pin myself to any figure.  If I were to do that, I would have to go into statistics and, as Deputy Little said, go in a detailed way into the work done by the Guards generally throughout the country, but while not pinning myself to any figure I think that the sum of close on £2,000,000 which the Gárda Síochána is costing at present could be very considerably reduced with advantage to the country. While doing that we do not want to victimise anyone.  We might be able to bring about a reduction in the manner Deputy O'Connell mentioned, by stopping recruiting and refusing to fill vacancies that normally arise.  But even if we had the power to do that, it might still be necessary to be more radical and reduce the strength of the police force at a much more rapid rate than the carrying out of that suggestion would mean.  I do not want to commit myself to that as I do not <Col N="1630" /> know the facts.  We would like it to be understood that we stand for the ordinary work done by the Guards, so far as that work is done in strict accordance with law and order, and with impartiality as between every class of citizen without relation to or any cognisance of citizens' political opinions.  We are not satisfied that in some respects certain elements of the Gárdaí have been doing that.  We are convinced that a considerable reduction could be made, and should be made, in the cost of the Gárda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I hope that the economies which the Minister indicated it was the intention of the Department to carry out in connection with the Gárda Síochána will not include a refusal to connect the various Gárda stations with the telephone system.  This matter was discussed on the Estimate last year.  It was then urged that there should be a further extension of the telephone to all Gárda stations on the main routes.  Several main routes pass through my constituency.  There is a tremendous amount of traffic on them and accidents are constantly taking place.  I know a number of Gárda stations which are not connected by the telephone system and ought to be.  Failure to connect them with that system would, I think, be a very bad kind of economy to practice.  When accidents occur on these main routes they can be almost immediately attended to if the local Gárda station is connected up with the telephone system.  In this connection I would like to mention the Gárda station at Kill, which is a couple of miles outside Naas.  It is at the end of a long stretch of lonely road where very little help would be available if it was not for the station being there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody I have come across views with any degree of satisfaction the closing down of Gárda stations.  I never heard anybody talking in enthusiastic terms of the good that is done by the closing down of stations. Generally it is the other way, that <Col N="1631" /> they do not like it being done.  I think whatever economies are being practised, or whatever way the money is saved, the people would prefer that it should not be done in that way.  Deputy O'Kelly compared the position in English villages with that in Irish villages.  He said that he spent six months in England. For a great many years, perhaps for twenty years, I was in the habit of spending at least four months every year in the North of England, and I know that part very well.  What Deputy O'Kelly said about stations being run in very quiet rural districts by one man is perfectly true, and in a great many places in the North of England it could be done quite easily.  But to compare these kind of villages with Ireland is quite impossible.  We have been through a revolution and civil war here, and the reflex of all that must remain for some time however matters quieten down.  Then we have such things as the making of poteen, which does not occur in England, as far as I am aware.</P>

      <P>It does not.  We have not got sufficient cover for it.  As I said, the countries are not comparable for we have had years of misrule in this country before our native Government took it over, and that is a matter that cannot be settled down in a day.  We must proceed slowly and quietly to get the country into order, and when that happy day arrives then Deputy O'Kelly may be satisfied perhaps by a considerable reduction in the police forces, but until then I think very few people would view with anything but alarm any considerable reduction in the force.  If a plebiscite were taken on this subject I have not the slightest doubt that there would be a large majority against any reduction whatever. From these remarks it may be taken that it is not my intention to support the amendment to refer this Estimate back.  I propose to give my support to the Estimate and to the <Col N="1632" /> Minister, as I have always done and as I intend to do for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">

      <P>I suppose Deputies on every side of the House regret that it has not been possible to bring in an estimate in which the figure would be much lower than £1,600,000. We know that the claim has often been made that there should be a reduction. If the sentiments expressed in the speech by Deputy O'Kelly on this matter were shared by every party and by the people in every corner of our land, that there should be respect of law and order, it would lead the way to the time when our police system here would correspond with that in England.  Mention has been made to-night of fears in the minds of the Civic Guards in the event of a change of Government.  I do not think these fears are deeply grounded.  I am in rather a unique position, because members of parties of all shades of political thought talk to me now and again, and I know that everywhere young men want to join the Civic Guards.  If there were any fears for the future, or of the Government in power or of any Government that might come into power, I do not think there could be the huge waiting list there is for the Civic Guards.  There has been some talk about the Civic Guards not doing right.  I have some experience of the Civic Guards and I think that in the main they have carried out, and are carrying out, their duties with credit.  It is not their fault that their numbers are larger than we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe referred to illicit distilling.  There is not the amount of illicit distilling that there was some years ago.  In that respect the Civic Guards have done good work, and also in regard to the licensing laws, and in other ways I think they are doing their duty very well. They have extra duties to perform in the Border counties.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that perhaps it is desirable other services should be provided for the Guards which they might find time to attend to, and economy could be effected in that way.  In all bodies there is the <Col N="1633" /> human tendency to err, and I suppose we cannot look for perfection in the Civic Guards any more than elsewhere. But as I said, on the whole I think the Civic Guards are doing their duty very well.  I was very glad to hear the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Kelly.  I think that speech gave a hopeful sign with regard to the possibility of a reduction of the strength of the police forces. If the people generally re-echoed these sentiments we could have a reduction in this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the statement that we have too many Civic Guards.  I believe we have far too few in the City of Dublin for the purpose of controlling traffic.  There are several important and congested street-crossings in the city of Dublin, and it is almost a scandal that at some of these there is not a policeman on point duty.  I agree that in the rural districts the Civic Guards should get more work of a civil nature.  I do not see why&mdash;I made this suggestion before to the Minister but he did not adopt it&mdash;the Civic Guards after six months training in the Depot should not undertake sanitary inspection.  This is work for which we have no adequate staff in Ireland to do justice to and I know of no better man for this purpose than the Civic Guard for he is young, active and capable of penetrating the most inaccessible parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another way in which they might be employed would be to utilise them as rate-collectors.  I think you could very well employ them as rate-collectors and thus save a good deal of trouble and a good deal of money. In that case the Gárda would be a man who would carry some authority with him.  When he would call for the rates the defaulters would come to the conclusion that he meant business.  There is another way in which the Gárda might be employed&mdash;that is, for postal deliveries in rural areas.  I do not see why the Gárda would not deliver the post.  If I were a revolutionary I would suggest it.  If there is any <Col N="1634" /> sincerity in saying that the Gárda should be given more civil administration work then we cannot say that this is not the sort of work that should be given them.  In that way there could be a good deal of economies effected.</P>

      <P>I want no postman dismissed.  But according as new vacancies would arise the Gárda could be brought into the work. There are areas within 25 miles of Dublin and if you post a letter there at 3.30 on Saturday it would not reach Dublin until the Tuesday following.  If the work were done by the Gárda there would be a better postal service got for the people by availing of motor bicycles, and so on.  In my suggestions I am not disemploying anybody.  I am merely recommending the putting of the Gárda at additional useful work that they could do better than anyone else.  Another thing they might usefully do would be road inspection. Owing to the road mileage in the country and the limited number of county surveyors and their assistants one finds it quite a common thing to see a bridge broken down for a day or for a week without anybody reporting it.  That should be work that the Gárda might do for the safety of the people.  I did not expect that my remarks would cause so much mirth, and I quite fail to see why they are the occasion of so much amusement to some Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>

      <P>When we say that the Gárda should be employed more than they are on civil administration we do not mean that as just a phrase that may sound well.  I am giving the House instances of work at which the Gárda might be usefully employed and with advantage to the country.  I think it was a mistake on the part of Deputy O'Kelly to say that the cost of the Gárda <Col N="1635" /> was nearly £2,000,000.  On looking at the Estimates I see that the figure for the Gárda is put down at £1,604,005.  I think that is the correct sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with a great deal of interest to the mover and seconder of the motion to refer back for reconsideration this Vote for the Gárda Síochána.  But neither the mover nor the seconder has satisfied me that there is any reason whatsoever for referring this Vote back.  It has been suggested, for the purpose of economy, that a number of stations would be reduced and, incidentally, that the personnel of the Gárda should be reduced.  If we are to have economies, these economies must be consistent with efficiency.  When I say efficiency I do not refer to the sergeant-major type of efficiency, but I mean the efficiency that we expect to find in a good police force and peace officers. I want to submit to the House that for a young force the Gárda Síochána have undoubtedly created a very favourable impression all over the Saorstát, and not alone in the Saorstát, but they have received encomiums from many visitors to our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Dr. Hennessy, who is usually very interesting and at times very amusing, when he set about getting further employment for the Gárda. In my view the Gárda have quite enough to do as peace officers without being turned into postmen, rate collectors, and perhaps the next thing we would find is that they would be asked to collect doctors' bills, which, I am sure, would be very satisfactory from Deputy Hennessy's point of view and those of his profession.  At the moment at any rate I do not think that it would be good business on the part of this State to reduce the personnel of the Gárda in any way whatsoever.  I deprecate also, and I am sure that every peaceably disposed citizen of this State must deprecate, the constant nibbling at the Gárda in recent years.  The Gárda were deprived of <Col N="1636" /> a number of allowances.  And it is an unstabilising thing to find from time to time, when this Vote comes up, that criticism is directed usually against their allowances, or that it is directed towards adding extra duties to their already quite sufficient duties.</P>
    <P>In my view any reduction of the Gárda Siochána at the present moment would be almost criminal. A sense of security is felt in the country at present by virtue of the fact that we know that we have a good and efficient police force.  In saying that I do not want to be taken as defending in any way the attitude or conduct of individual Gárda.  We know that there are in every police force in the world black sheep and I am prepared to admit that in the past there have been, and possibly at present there are still, some back sheep in the Gárda.  But that is no reason why we should condemn the whole body of the Gárda.  There is another argument and that is, that we know that there are in this country as well as in other countries evilly-disposed persons. We also know that in this country there are numbers of people who are not prepared to help, but rather to hinder the administration of the law. We quite recently had a manifestation of that spirit.</P>
    <P>Too many gestures have been made in this House to certain classes of the community who have been encouraged to break up public meetings called for specific constitutional purposes and in furtherance of the constitutional rights of the people. Attempts have been made to prevent these public meetings being held. In view of these facts it is not right nor is it a proper policy on the part of any person or Party to criticise, unduly the Gárda Síochána.  Deputy T.J. O'Connell said that the Gárda were called upon to discharge duties that were not discharged by the police force that preceded them. This is so.  I can bear tribute to the work done by the Gárda in the matter of policing the rivers of the country, preventing poaching and thereby largely adding to the wealth of this country.  I know they have <Col N="1637" /> also quite recently undertaken duties as school attendance officers and things of that kind.  They are performing these duties effectively. I should say that if it is found later on that circumstances may warrant its being found possible to reduce the personnel of the Gárda, other functions might be added to the work they discharge at present.  I have in mind many things which they could be asked to do and usefully do in the country.  The time will come when I will be able to indicate what these functions are, not the kind of duties which Deputy Hennessy proposed that the police should be asked to do.</P>

      <P>I could for instance get back to certain proposals made for the agricultural development of this country.  These proposals were supposed to spell greater expense but I could show the House how the Gárda could easily perform the duties which would be imposed upon them under a national scheme for increased acreage under wheat.  In such a scheme the Gárda could act as surveyors and inspectors.  I just mentioned that matter in answer to the interruption by Deputy Dr. Hennessy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the common experience in this country that in the Gárda Síochána we have a very excellent force.  I would be very sorry to see this motion, proposing the reconsideration of the Vote, passed in this House.  It would not tend towards stability.  We can easily understand the psychology of a young policeman who enters the force with the very best intentions of adopting it as a career and ambitious enough to seek promotion. If we are to keep nibbling at this particular service it will have a very discouraging and disturbing effect on those young men.  I do not care whether it is a Cumann na nGaedheal, a Fianna Fáil or a <Col N="1638" /> Labour Government is in power, I suggest with all due respect that it is not a right or proper thing, particularly at this juncture of our history, to do anything that would disturb the confidence of the members of the Gárda Síochána.  They have very important duties to do and they are frequently brought into conflict with certain elements in the country. They have to carry out duties which to them are frequently distasteful. Nevertheless, the general experience is that they carry out those duties as well as they are carried out by police forces in other countries.</P>
      <P>There is another point which should have some weight with all Parties in this House.  I think there is common agreement amongst all sections of the community who have any regard for morality in this country&mdash;when I say morality I speak in general terms&mdash;that the Gárda have performed one very useful duty.  We do know it was the common practice in this country for many years before the advent of the Gárda and before we got control of our own affairs to have what is known as personation at elections.  I will pay this tribute to the Gárda, and I think every Party in the House should pay them this tribute, that, irrespective of Party, they sat or stood, as the case might be, in the various booths during two, three or four elections and recorded the names of voters as they passed into these booths.  That was one of the greatest deterrents to one of the most immoral practices ever prevalent in this country&mdash;the foul, filthy practice of personation.  The two big Parties have often charged one another with this practice of personation.</P>

It may be that at a later period the candidates for election will be saved a good deal of expense by the Gárda Síochána delivering the letters, papers, etc., composing political propaganda in the manner suggested by Deputy Hennessy.

      <P>Deputy Anthony said that no reason was given by the proposer of the motion in support of it. I wonder was Deputy Anthony here when the proposer was speaking.  If not, I would ask him to refer to page 109 of the Estimates, where he will see that the total estimated cost of this service during the coming year will be £1,909,608.  The main reason why the Dáil is asked to refer this Vote back for reconsideration is that the service is costing more than the country can afford to pay.  As Deputy O'Kelly said, almost one-tenth of the total tax revenue of the State is being expended to maintain this single service.  Deputy Anthony said that, in his opinion, there were not too many Guards, but he appears to be alone in that opinion.  Deputy Hennessy, Deputy Haslett, and <Col N="1640" /> Deputies from various benches, expressed the opinion that there is an excessive number of Guards in relation to the work they are asked to do.  There appears to be running through the minds of some Deputies the idea that under no circumstances must any Guard be given the impression that, regardless of what the financial and economic circumstances of the country may be, he is likely to be asked to leave the service.  Deputy Hennessy is even prepared to recommend the disemployment of a number of rural postmen and rate collectors in order that the Guards may be provided with adequate work.</P>

      <P>The fact is that not merely have we got an expensive police force, but the cost of it is yearly growing.  Deputies think there is an excessive number of Guards, but this year it is proposed to increase the number.  The reason for that increase is very hard to discover. The usual attitude taken up here by members of the Government Party when we suggest that economies in the Guards are possible is that members of Fianna Fáil attack the Guards because they are animated by political bias.  That is not the case at all.  The number and cost of the Civic Guards could be reduced with, in my opinion, an increase in the efficiency of the force. Deputy Wolfe made a suggestion which I would like to support for several reasons; that is, that every Civic Guard station should be equipped with a telephone.  It seems ridiculous that Civic Guard stations are not equipped with telephones because one of the quickest ways of getting information about a crime to the police is by means of the telephone. The telephone would also provide a rapid channel of communication between the local Guards and central police stations.  By utilising the telephone, by substituting for isolated stations a system of motor patrols, and by the introduction of <Col N="1641" /> other methods of a similar nature, the cost of the Guards could be substantially reduced.  Like other Deputies, I cannot give an estimate of what the minimum amount required to run an efficient police force would be.  I remember, however, the late Michael Collins submitting an estimate to the First or Second Dáil, before the establishment of the Free State, in which he put the figure of half a million pounds as representing in his opinion the amount which would be required to pay for an adequate police force for the entire thirty-two counties.</P>
      <P>I agree that may appear to be an under-estimate, but it does indicate that there was at one time a very different idea prevalent in the minds of members who now constitute the present Government as to what an efficient police force could be run for in this country.  It may be argued that the strength of the Guards cannot be reduced because any suggestion that such would be our policy would create a sense of insecurity in the minds of the Guards.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Connell refer to the danger of having a sense of insecurity created in the minds of members of the Guards.  However, it should be made clear, in the first place, that a member of the Guards is as liable to suffer during a period of severe economic depression as a person in any other employment.  If economies have got to be practised everybody has got to share in them.  On the other hand, if there is room for improvement, the Guards can hope to get their boot allowance or some other allowance restored to them if finances permit of it.  The position is that any feeling of insecurity created in the minds of the Guards in reference to a possible change of Government has been deliberately fostered by responsible members of the present Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance went to Monaghan within the past two months and made statements deliberately designed to create that sense of insecurity in the minds of the Guards and thus, of course, induce the relatives of the Guards <Col N="1642" /> throughout the country to vote for the candidates of his Party at a general election.  He was deliberately jeopardising the efficiency of the service for political purposes. The only attempt made to repair any damage which the Minister for Finance might have caused came from the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was never the policy of Fianna Fáil, and I do not think that it ever will be to victimise anybody because of his political opinions.  Members of the Civic Guard under a Fianna Fáil Government will be enlisted, promoted, or removed because of the efficiency or inefficiency with which they perform their duties and for no other reason.  Any member of the Guards who is conscientiously carrying out his work can feel as safe in office as any employee of any firm in the country who is doing the same thing.  No sensible employer will dismiss a man who is doing his work properly unless the circumstances of his industry make a reduction of staff absolutely essential.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehy told us that there are the names of 10,000 people on the waiting list of the Civic Guard.  That is true.  It disproves the statement that the attitude of Fianna Fáil has created a feeling of insecurity in regard to the future of the force.  There are 10,000 people waiting to get any soft job that is going.  Under present circumstances, a position in the Civic Guard is a soft job.  It is one of the best paid jobs in the country for the type of individual required.  Any member of the Dáil who has had experience of travelling to any extent through the country has, I am sure, noticed the general air of inactivity that prevails around a police barrack which is disturbed only when the sergeant and one of his men play hand-ball against the gable end.  In quite a number of cases the Guards themselves will tell you that they are killed with boredom because they have nothing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have quite a number of letters <Col N="1643" /> on my file from Guards who have complained that, because of some false charge of indiscipline brought against them&mdash;of course, the charge is always false&mdash;they were removed to what they term &ldquo;bog stations,&rdquo; where there is nothing to do from one end of the day to the other except watch the grass grow.  It is well known that, outside the cities and towns, the majority of the Guards have not got sufficient work to do.  I am not altogether in favour of Deputy O'Connell's suggestion that we should make work for them. We have a very large amount of official interference with our ordinary lives and I would not like to see it increased unless it was necessary. Nor would I like to see the Guards used, as Deputy Dr. Hennessy suggested, to disemploy other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was any new work which could be undertaken that would not disemploy other people but that might increase the duties of the Guards, it should be considered by the Minister.  The position at the present time is that there are too many Guards and the method of organisation in the force is such as not to provide the greatest degree of efficiency.  That is the main reason why we are asking that this Vote should be referred back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason which concerns the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Justice only.  I refer to the policy which he has put into operation and in pursuit of which he has been using the Guards and which has resulted as he knows, in several verdicts being given by juries against the Guards.  In so far as that is the case, we can take it that public opinion is against that policy.  Each of the Guards who was charged with assault in the Courts, defended himself on the plea that he was merely carrying out the orders <Col N="1644" /> he got.  That was, as far as he was concerned, a perfectly legitimate defence. The person responsible for giving these orders, the person who should have known that they were illegal orders, was the Minister for Justice.  We think that the Dáil, if it is half as anxious to preserve respect for the law and for the Guards, as it pretends, should indicate that fact by expressing disapproval of the Minister's policy by voting for the reference back of the Vote.  The Minister has done more within the last twelve months to bring disrespect and discredit upon the machinery established by the State for the maintenance of law and order than any other individual in the country.  If we got an assurance from him or from the Government that the policy which has been declared to be illegal by the Courts is not going to be followed in the future, then we could perhaps treat the situation as being less serious than it appears, but apparently the Minister, despite the fact that Judges and juries have repeatedly declared that policy to be illegal, is still enforcing it and compelling members of the Guards to carry it out.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the ultimate aim of the Government may be in this matter, but it does seem that they are anxious to foment a sense of insecurity and disorder amongst the people, because they believe that only in such an atmosphere can they pose as the cast-iron strong men whom the country needs to save it from anarchy.  That is the one card they can play at election time, and they can only play it, of course, if the necessary atmosphere exists. Because it does not exist of its own accord, they are trying to create it.</P>
