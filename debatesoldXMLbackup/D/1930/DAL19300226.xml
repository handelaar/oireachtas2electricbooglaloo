    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Destruction of Dublin Premises.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is prepared to reconsider his decision with regard to the claim of Mrs. Adelaide A. Repetto-Byrne for compensation for the loss incurred by the destruction of her premises at 29 Henry Street, Dublin, due to their occupation by Republican forces in the Rising of 1916.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reopen the case referred to, which has already, on several occasions, been sympathetically considered from every angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If some new facts can be brought to the notice of the Minister, would he reconsider the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there can be no new facts brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister whether he is taking up the attitude of absolutely turning these people down, as up to the present facts have not been brought to his notice which would give them a right to reconsideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the case first four or five years ago and I was reluctantly driven to the conclusion that nothing could be done in the matter.  I have since had it reconsidered, at least, two or three times and I am satisfied that there is no use in going into the matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the case made now that the claim of these people <Col N="846" /> should be against the British Government rather than the Saorstát Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That was made on one occasion.  Would the Minister state, if it can be shown that the case which was fought in the Courts was won on points which have not since been carried out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that he would reconsider the matter on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is nothing new that could be brought forward at this stage.  I would be very surprised if anything new could be brought forward, and I do not think that it would be advisable to go into it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that he thinks there is nothing new to be brought forward, but would he not give these people an opportunity of satisfying him that there is nothing new to bring forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent people who have new facts writing in regard to the claim and, if they have new facts, no doubt I will be informed on that.  I think that that is the only thing that can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state (a) the full amount of the land annuities and interest in lieu of rent, etc., paid to Britain for each of the fiscal years 1922-1923 to 1928-29 inclusive, and for the part of the fiscal year to February 20th, 1929; (b) the sub-division of the said annual payment of annuities, etc., as between (i) Purchase Acts, 1881-8, (ii) Purchase Acts, 1891-6; (iii) Purchase Act, 1903; (iv)  Purchase Act, 1909, and (v)  Labourers Acts, 1906-14.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the Deputy's question involves tabular statements of some length, I propose circulating it with the Dáil Debates. Reply as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amounts paid to the appropriate British Fund or Account in respect to Land Purchase Annuities, <Col N="847" /> including interest, under the Land Purchase Acts, 1891-1909 (including <Col N="848" /> the Labourers Acts) in each of the financial years 1922-23 to 1929-30, inclusive, were as follows:</P>

      <P>The number of <Col N="849" /> applications for telephone service in the Rathmines, Rathgar and Terenure areas not complied with is 115, of which 10 are between 12 and 18 months on record and 8 longer than 18 months.  Of the remainder, 34 are less than 3 months.  The cause of the delay in providing service is the impossibility of taking on additional subscribers at the existing Rathmines Exchange, which is obsolete and congested. Authority has been received for the erection of new automatic exchanges at Rathmines and Terenure but, as these cannot be in operation for about two years, consideration is being given to the possibility of providing, as a temporary expedient, an additional manual exchange in the area, so as to enable service to be afforded in the meantime to all who require it.  There is no difficulty as regards service in the Rathfarnham district and no applicants unprovided for.  As a special measure arrangements are being made, and will be shortly in force, to serve applicants residing in Rathdown Park and vicinity temporarily from Rathfarnham until such time as they can be connected to an exchange at Terenure.</P>

There was considerable delay in the acquisition of the site, and, having acquired it, we found that we could not hope to complete the building of the automatic exchange before two and a half years. On that account we resorted to a temporary expedient, and we hope in a short time to be able to provide for the number of people who are anxious to get telephones.</P>

Neither am I aware that the police party, or any member thereof, used obscene language to Mr. Murray's daughter, but I am aware that Mr. Murray's daughter, whose room was not amongst those searched, got up voluntarily during the course of the search for the purpose of subjecting the search party to abusive language.</P>

The note-book containing the list was returned on the 4th instant as the Gárda Síochána were then satisfied that it was not of the character originally suspected. The note-book was returned to Mr. Walsh in exactly the same condition in which it was when first taken.  The suggestion that the police were in any way responsible for abstracting any of the leaves from the note-book is unfounded.</P>

      <P>Accurate information as to the incidence of contagious abortion in the Saorstát could be obtained only by a veterinary inspection of every herd of cows in the country, and by the application of the agglutination test to the blood of all suspected animals.

Owners of herds are provided by the Department with facilities for obtaining at a small cost the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. A leaflet giving full information in regard to the disease and its treatment is also widely circulated.

I may add that the imports of compound feeding stuffs into the Saorstát are only about one-fourth to one-fifth of the total volume of the oil-seed cakes and meals and other foods of vegetable origin imported for the feeding of animals. Imports of &ldquo;other foods of vegetable origin,&rdquo; in which classification compound feeding stuffs are included, show a decrease in 1929 as compared with the two previous years.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Declaration accepting as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice signed at Geneva on the 14th day of September, 1929, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 20th day of February, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for its ratification.</P>
      <P>The Declaration that was signed at Geneva in September, 1929, accepting compulsory jurisdiction was couched in the following language:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On behalf of the Irish Free State, I declare that I accept as compulsory, ipso facto and without special convention, the jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice for a period of twenty years and on the sole condition of reciprocity.  This Declaration is subject to ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> On the paper on which that Declaration is printed there is also printed Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court, to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>To get this into its proper setting we must go back a little bit into history and join up the Statute of the Permanent Court with the Treaty of Versailles.  I only want to refer briefly to that in order to point out to Deputies that those who drew up the conditions which terminated the 1914 War understood that they had something more to do than merely to put on record the conditions upon which peace was to be established. They realised that after that tremendous outbreak world conditions had to be so supervised and watched as to make war unlikely, or at least to weaken the possibilities of any such upheaval ever taking place again.  They set themselves the task not merely of bringing one war to an end but of trying to get nations to agree to terms that would render war almost an unheard of thing in future.  The Covenant of the League of Nations was part of the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant contained numerous sections which deal with the methods that were then before the framers of the Treaty of Versailles, for ensuring peace in the world hereafter.  The clauses of the Covenant of the League, to which I refer, were those which run from XI. to XVII.  One of the intervening ones has no great relevance in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to go through those.  Article XI. lays down:</P>
    <P>Any war or threat of war. whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.  In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of <Col N="879" /> any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.</P>
    <P>It is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.</P>
    <P>Article XII. indicated three methods by which disputes might be brought to a solution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council.</P>
    <P>2.  In any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Article XIII. refers to two of the methods suggested for the ensuring of peace:</P>
    <P>1. The members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognise to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement, and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration or judicial settlement.</P>
    <P>The next portion has special relevance to the optional clause:</P>
    <P>2.  Disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which if established would constitute a <Col N="880" /> breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement.</P>
    <P>The third paragraph of Article XIII. reads:</P>
    <P>3.  For the consideration of any such dispute, the court to which the case is referred shall be the Permanent Court of International Justice, established in accordance with Article XIV., or any tribunal agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them.</P>
    <P>The concluding section of the Article is:</P>
    <P>4.  The members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith.  In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.</P>
    <P>So far there have been pointed out three methods of having disputes, likely to lead to a rupture, determined and in particular certain questions have been segregated out and declared to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement and the question of judicial settlement had been brought a step further by the section of Article XIII. which speaks of the Court being the permanent court of international justice established in accordance with Article XIV., or any tribunal agreed upon by the parties. Article XIV. deals with how the Court was to be established:</P>
    <P>The Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice. The Court shall be competent to <Col N="881" /> hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.</P>
    <P>Article XV. is a lengthy article, and it refers back again to the submission to the Council, and it has not any special relevance to the Permanent Court, so that I do not propose to read it.</P>
    <P>Article XVII. has some relevance, and lays down:</P>
    <P>1.  In the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States not Members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just.  If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles XII.  to XVI. inclusive, shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council.</P>
    <P>2.  Upon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>3.  If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article XVI. shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.</P>
    <P>4.  If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> That was the opening part; it simply segregated out certain ways of determining disputes likely to lead to war.  It referred to the Court which was to be established, and then stated that certain matters singled out as most suitable for submission to the Court for judicial settlement should be referred to that Court.</P>
    <P>Some time later proposals for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice were brought up.  A committee of jurists had been appointed to go into the whole matter, and when certain arguments and certain decisions had been taken as to whether resort to the Court should be compulsory or not there was finally brought up for adoption by the League, and adopted by the League the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the sections which deal with the competence of the Court.  Chapter II. is the relevant chapter, and it runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Article XXXIV.&mdash;Only States or Members of the League of Nations can be parties in cases before the Court.</P>
    <P>Article XXXV.&mdash;The Court shall be open to the Members of the League, and also to States mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which the Court shall be open to other States shall, subject to the special provisions contained in treaties in force, be laid down by the Council, but in no case shall such provisions place the parties in a position of inequality before the Court.</P>
    <P>When a State which is not a Member of the League of Nations is a party to a dispute, the Court will fix the amount which that party is to contribute towards the expenses of the Court.</P>
    <P>Article XXXVI. is the specially relevant article here.  It is the one quoted in the paper already presented to the House, and I need not <Col N="883" /> read it, but I want to refer to the fact that the jurisdiction of the Court, when recognised as compulsory, was declared to be effective regarding all or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning four categories of matters set out: the interpretation of a treaty; any questions of international law, etc.&mdash;those matters which had previously been declared by the Covenant to be suitable for submission to judicial settlement. The other sections of that article state simply the law which the Court is to apply and the procedure for getting before the Court.</P>
    <P>There was one dispute before the statute of the Court was passed.  The committee of jurists wished to have it that that Court as established should be compulsory; that the States' members of the League would have to bind themselves to resort to the Court in the matters that were defined.  This was objected to when the matter came before the League itself and, eventually, it was passed not in a compulsory form.  The Court was established under the auspices of the League but Article XXXVI left it that it did not automatically apply but only applied when certain people signified their intention of applying it as between themselves:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Members of the League of Nations and the States mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying the protocol to which the present Statute is adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that they recognise as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other Member or State accepting the same obligation the jurisdiction of the Court in all or any of the classes of legal disputes concering&rdquo;&mdash; then four matters follow&mdash;The declaration referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain Members or States, or for a certain time</P>
    <P>In the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, <Col N="884" /> the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the statute establishing the Court was passed and adopted by the League it by no means meant that the jurisdiction of the Court came immediately into operation even in the class of dispute referred to between all States members of the League.  It was left for a later decision whether or not States-members would recognise the compulsory part.  There was also a certain discrimination allowed to the States so signing as to whether or not they would recognise the jurisdiction of the Court in respect to all or any of the classes of legal disputes referred to and there were certain other matters left to the choice of the nations signing.  These are matters I shall deal with later.</P>
    <P>The statute was passed, the Court was brought into being but the so-called optional clause which nations might opt to sign or not, but which when signed made resort to the Court compulsory, remained without very many people opting for it until this year.  The circumstances this year had, of course, changed considerably and changed mainly by reason of the fact that so many nations, members of the League, had signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact for the abolition of war. We had signed that amongst others and when it came to a decision in this matter we felt that having declared that war was no longer any part of national policy in relation to other States we must give further proof of good faith in the matter by indicating that we were prepared to have recourse to this method of judicial settlement in all cases where judicial settlement seemed to be the proper thing.</P>
    <P>As between the States members of the British Commonwealth of Nations this point had previously been raised. It had been declared in the 1926 report that although all the countries there represented were agreed that the extension of the principle of judicial settlement was favoured, they felt it would be premature, at that time, to proceed to the signature of the Optional Clause.  We did not feel <Col N="885" /> that it would be premature at that time to proceed to the signature but as the matter was simply put that a great number of nations had not signed and as there seemed to be a likelihood that all the nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations would sign later on, the matter was left over for a little.  In 1928, the Canadian delegates at the League indicated that they were prepared to pledge their faith to arbitration as a means of settlement of international disputes, and the Premier, Mr. Mackenzie King, who was the Canadian delegate, indicated his Government's readiness to accept the jurisdiction in the permanent court.  The Vice-President of this State, who was a delegate on that occasion, also indicated our desire to move forward to the signature of the Optional Clause, and the acceptance as compulsory of the jurisdiction of the court in the matters referred to. When the present British Government came into office last year they wrote to us inquiring as to our position, and notified us that they were considering the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the permanent court and asked for our views.  We responded, at once, that we had always been in favour of signing and were very definitely in accord with their line, so far as that line led to the acceptance in a compulsory way of the jurisdiction of the court.</P>
    <P>We proceeded, therefore, to Geneva this year.  Before the delegates went to Geneva, on the Appropriation Bill in the Seanad Senator Johnson, after reading certain quotations that appeared in English Sunday newspapers, with regard to the Optional Clause, and alluding to certain reservations that those newspapers considered likely to be imported into a British signature, questioned me as to the policy of the Government of this country with regard to the Optional Clause.  On that occasion I replied to him: &ldquo;There was never any question of a reservation such as the &lsquo;Observer&rsquo; spoke <Col N="886" /> of, and, to my mind, the quotation which Senator Johnson gave from the Optional Clause shows that that particular reservation could not be made&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I am leaving out certain matter: &ldquo;Members of the League of Nations are to sign a declaration that they recognise as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any other Member or State accepting the same obligation the jurisdiction of the Court in all or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning: (a) the interpretation of a Treaty; (b) any question of International Law; and the other two points referred to by Senator Johnson.  Reservations may be made either in regard to reciprocity between States, Members of the League, or in regard to time.  To my mind, clearly the only reservation that can be made and the only reservations that so far have been made are in regard to time or reciprocity between certain States.  Most of the States which have already signed the Optional Clause have made reservations on the point of reciprocity, and a number have signed with a time limitation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then went to the other point that Senator Johnson had alluded to. I said &ldquo;Senator Johnson correctly outlined our normal relationships with the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>We recognise a certain relationship established by the Treaty, and in determining disputes between ourselves and Great Britain we would try the ordinary methods of negotiation to see if they could be settled. The matter in dispute might be a matter of Commonwealth importance as opposed to one of importance only to ourselves and Great Britain, and we might have some sort of Commonwealth conference on it, but in no event can we rule out the possibility of appeal to the International Court or suffer the right of recourse to that Court to be removed from us.  But normally we recognise the particular relationship between Members of the Commonwealth and we would try to hammer out an agreement among ourselves.  We have given indications <Col N="887" /> on several occasions that we are anxious to sign the Optional Clause, but we are not going to accept any reservations in connection with the signature which would reduce signature to a farce.&rdquo;  (Seanad Debates, 17th July, columns 1425-1426.)</P>
    <P>That was the declaration of policy that I made before going to Geneva.  On proceeding to Geneva we found that the signature to the Optional Clause was the outstanding matter of last year's Assembly.  It was raised by a number of people, but it was specially raised by the British Prime Minister, who pleaded that the Assembly might so direct its attention to the Optional Clause that the Assembly itself would be known in history as the Optional Clause meeting.  We later came to the question of signature and to the question of reservations that would seem proper to us to make when we were signing.  There were quite long discussions on the reservations, which certain of the Dominion Governments were inclined to accept, and which most of them did in fact accept afterwards.  We could not agree to these.  We signed in the form which is before the House&mdash;in the simple form: &ldquo;We accept as compulsory ipso facto and without special convention the jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice for a period of twenty years and on the sole condition of reciprocity.&rdquo; The declaration which was signed by the British Government was different. It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and subject to ratification, I accept as compulsory ipso facto and without special convention, on condition of reciprocity, the jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Court, for a period of ten years and thereafter until such time as notice may be given to terminate the acceptance, over all disputes arising after the <Col N="888" /> ratification of the present declaration with regard to situations or facts subsequent to the said ratification, other than:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disputes in regard to which the parties to the dispute have agreed or shall agree to have recourse to some other method of peaceful settlement; and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disputes with the Government of any other member of the League which is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, all of which disputes shall be settled in such manner as the parties have agreed or shall agree; and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disputes with regard to questions which by international law fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And subject to the condition that His Majesty's Government reserve the right to require that proceedings in the Court shall be suspended in respect of any dispute which has been submitted to and is under consideration by the Council of the League of Nations, provided that notice to suspend is given after the dispute has been submitted to the Council and is given within ten days of the notification of the initiation of the proceedings in the Court, and provided also that such suspension shall be limited to a period of twelve months or such longer period as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute or determined by a decision of all the Members of the Council other than the parties to the dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The meaning of those reservations I think can best be followed by reading to the House what was said by Mr. Henderson, who signed on behalf of the British Government at the time.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Optional Clause&rsquo; which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are now accepting gives the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague jurisdiction over juridical disputes with other parties accepting the <Col N="889" /> like obligation without the necessity for framing in respect of each dispute a special agreement for its submission to the Court.</P>
    <P>The formula which I have just signed on behalf of the United Kingdom and copies of which are, I believe, available follows the usual practice in being subject to reciprocity and in including a time-limit.  This is fixed at ten years, but the acceptance continues in force after the expiration of this period unless notice is given to terminate it.  The signature is also subject to ratification.  This will enable the question to be raised in Parliament, if so desired, before the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction comes into operation.</P>
    <P>The declaration accepting the jurisdiction covers only disputes which may arise in future.  Past disputes and disputes relating to past events will continue to be submitted to the Court under a special agreement concluded in each case.</P>
    <P>Three classes of disputes are excluded from the operation of the declaration of acceptance.  These are disputes for the submission of which to some other method of peaceful settlement provision is made by existing or future agreements, disputes with other Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and disputes about matters which fall within what is called the domestic jurisdiction of a State.  Commercial treaties and conventions dealing with special subjects, such as reparations, or with technical matters, such as copyright, very often contain provisions setting up special tribunals to deal with disputes which may arise as to the meaning of application of their terms.  When that is the case, the dispute will be dealt with as provided in the agreement and will not be submitted to the Court at The Hague.  This is the effect of the exclusion of the first class of disputes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> The second paragraph is an important paragraph.  It is specially important because this is the exact form in which Mr. Henderson spoke. He was not correctly reported in the newspapers when the speech was delivered.  This is the form in which he spoke.  We know that, because we heard it spoken in this form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disputes with other Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are excluded, because the Members of the Commonwealth, though international units individually in the fullest sense of the term, are united by their common allegiance to the Crown, Disputes between them should, therefore, be dealt with by some other mode of settlement, and for this provision is made in the exclusion clause.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On certain matters, international law recognises that the authority of the State is supreme. When once it is determined that the subject-matter of the dispute falls within the category of cases where this is so, there is no scope for the exercise of the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then spoke on the last proviso of all with regard to the sending of disputes to the Council of the League &mdash;that the British Government might require that proceedings should be suspended.  I do not think it is of any great relevancy.  If it is thought to be I can read what was said about it.</P>
    <P>Two declarations were made in addition to the declaration made by Mr. Henderson.  The South African delegate made this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the reservation as to disputes between Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, I wish to state that, although in the view of my Government such disputes are justiciable by the International Court of Justice, my Government prefers to settle them by other means&mdash; hence the reservation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The representative of Canada made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dominion of Canada has excluded from the purview of the Court legal disputes with other Members of the British Commonwealth for the sole reason that it is its expressed policy to settle these matters by some other methods, and it has deemed opportune to include its will as a reservation, although a doubt may exist as to such reservation being consistent with Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first reason why we refused to sign a declaration like that was that it was contrary to our policy to do so; another reason was that we felt grave doubts as to such reservation being consistent with Article 36 of the Statute.  Article 36 and its terms must be adverted to here.  The terms are given in the leaflet already circulated.</P>
    <P>Leaving out the first paragraph it reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Members of the League of Nations and the States mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying the protocol to which the present Statute is adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that they recognise as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other Member or State accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the interpretation of a treaty;</P>
    <P>(b)  any question of international law;</P>
    <P>(c)  the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation.</P>
    <P>(d)  the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> The declaration referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain Members or States, or for a certain time.</P>
    <P>In the event of a dispute, as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Into that framework there is attempted to be fitted a reservation which has a limitation which is allowable.  It has further the exclusion of certain disputes.  One class of excluded disputes is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disputes with the Government of any other Member of the League which is a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations all of which disputes shall be settled in such manner as the parties have agreed or shall agree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was competent for anybody signing this Article to have excluded any one of the classes of legal disputes mentioned in the A, B, C or D category.  If they were going to sign they had to sign for some one of these categories, but it was competent to exclude any number up to three.  It was competent for them to say: &ldquo;We signed unconditionally or on a condition of reciprocity on the part of certain Members or States and for a certain time.&rdquo; What does the phrase &ldquo;unconditionally or on a condition of reciprocity on the part of certain members&rdquo; mean?  So far as the clause or a clause like it has been incorporated in other Conventions and has been accepted, it means this: that certain nations have from time to time said with regard to Conventions: &ldquo;We accept that, whatever it may be, on condition that A, B and C nations also accept or that a certain nation accepts,&rdquo; but it has been unknown in any of these Conventions for any nation to say: &ldquo;We accept that with regard to every State except a certain mentioned one.&rdquo;  It is very hard to see&mdash;there is more than a doubt expressed&mdash; how far a declaration which excludes disputes with certain States mentioned can come within the <Col N="893" /> terms of Article 36.  That had some effect upon our decision as to whether or not we would make certain reservations.  The biggest reason was a matter of policy.  The second reason was that we were more than doubtful as to the validity of a reservation against certain States, members of the League of Nations.  However, it is a point which may not be very material, because I still go back to what I said in the Seanad, and I want to emphasise it again, that we do recognise a certain relationship established by the Treaty as between ourselves and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and in certain disputes arising hereafter between ourselves and any one of these other nations we would seek other means before we would go to the Court of International Justice.</P>
    <P>We would pretty well exhaust every other method of settlement before we would take the decision to try and force a dispute before the Permanent Court of International Justice.  We take that stand for the reasons I stated in the Seanad and read here&mdash;the special conditions that exist as between us, the fact that we do feel that although the Court should be there in the last resort and that we would not have our right to resort to that Court taken from us there should and very probably would be other methods of settlement more available to us, ones that we would more readily avail of, before we would go to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  We would have to be satisfied that the other means gave us a proper hearing, as to the procedure to be adopted, the type of law or convention to be administered and the people to decide.  But granted agreement on all these things, and that it would not be impossible to find that type of tribunal or type of law or convention to be administered before that tribunal, then I would state as the policy of this Government that the Court would be the last resort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> We have a further point of view, however, with regard to the British reservation.  The whole atmosphere of the Covenant of the League, the whole atmosphere of the Statute that established the Court is that disputes should be settled in some way other than war.  Three methods are indicated, inquiry by the council, arbitration or judicial settlement, but it is doubtful if the League of Nations would break on the point that a group of States, or even a majority of States of the League would agree in conventions or treaties between themselves to have special tribunals for the settlement of disputes as long as these tribunals would give a likelihood of disputes being settled without any rupture occurring.</P>
    <P>So long as there was in the background this Court and so long as they could get a certain number of nations to accept the principle of judicial settlement rather than war, I do not think that they were going to be much concerned about other tribunals.  Nevertheless, we felt that members of the League of Nations should uphold the Court specially established under the authority of the League, and should have a leaning towards that, and that only some peculiar or special relationship as between States should be considered a sufficiently important matter to preclude or postpone&mdash;because that, at its best, is all that could be done &mdash;recourse to the International Court.  We felt as members of the League that until a case was made for the other tribunal&mdash;and no case at the particular time we were discussing it had been made&mdash;there could be no justification for the establishment of the special tribunal, or for our refusing to go, as one member of the League, to a Court established by the League and choosing instead a special tribunal Consequently that point also had some bearing on the decision which we took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any authority <Col N="895" /> to decide whether the British reservation is valid and consistent with the Covenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is. The last sentence of the article provides for that.  The Court itself decides.  If a dispute arises and if it is a question whether or not the Court has a right to decide, the Court itself is the final authority to say whether it has or has not.</P>
      <P>If one were merely to take what I might call the narrow view of all this or desire to find out whether the legal view that an Irish delegation at last Assembly held was correct&mdash;a view apparently shared by the Canadian delegation and to some extent shared by the South African delegation&mdash;or whether the British declaration was valid, and therefore represented the correct view, we might look with favour on the early occurrence of some dispute that might give us reason to test it. One has, however, to look a little beyond that.</P>
      <P>Is it a sufficiently important thing to get a nation like Great Britain to sign that before going to war on certain matters here declared they will refer them for judicial settlement to the Court at the Hague, and further to sign that they will loyally abide by and carry out any decision of that Court?  Supposing the view that we had was the correct one, it might turn out then that the British attempt to accept the jurisdiction of the Court in a compulsory way had not been effective, and that they, in fact, had not signed and had not accepted as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now a very large group of nations this year took the step of accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of this Court.  The present position is that twenty States have both signed and ratified, twenty others have signed but not yet ratified, and fourteen States, members of the League, have not yet signed.  Forty States out of <Col N="896" /> fifty-four have either signed and ratified or signed and are moving towards ratification.  The meeting did become the Optional Clause Meeting.  People were swayed by the events of the last couple of years, by the Covenant of the League itself, the Kellogg Pact, and by the better feeling which there was in regard to peace.  People were signing also with a view to bringing to a speedier and better conclusion the Commission sitting on disarmament, because it was realised that the progress of disarmament was going to be very slow until there had been better progress in regard to bringing into the world some sense of security.  It is a very big thing, and if the British Government last year had not announced its intention of signing the Optional Clause it is doubtful whether there would be anything like the number of States agreeing to accept the jurisdiction of the Court.  One would have to deliberate long and seriously before one would welcome the occurrence of some case that would lead to a decision of the Court itself that the British reservation had been made in such a way that the signature was, in fact, of no effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any country definitely refused to accept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it can be said that anyone had definitely refused unless one considers as a refusal the fact that fourteen nations have not yet signed the Optional Clause.  We signed that Clause in the form in which we did sign it.  We had to consider very definitely at somewhat short notice what reservations, if any, we were going to put in.  We had to consider, in the atmosphere of which I have spoken, reservations which other delegations were putting in, and we had to weigh up and decide how far our refusal to stand on certain reservations would preclude the British <Col N="897" /> delegation this year from taking the step of signing.  We had, on the other side, our own declared policy in regard to the matter.  We wanted to have the Court as the last resort. We felt it our duty as Members of the League to stand by the Court, but we felt that we also had duties in regard to other nations in close association with us in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Although it was not then before us, we could see the possibility of a tribunal being established in such a way, with such laws to be administered and with such judges to administer them, as would give us as fair a decision in any case that might go before it as the International Court might give. There was no such Court concretely before us, and we signed for the Hague Court without reservation. It is a lucky thing from the point of view of the State Members of the League that the fact that we did not agree with the British reservation did not preclude the British delegation from signing.  That would have been something approaching a calamity from the point of view of the other Members of the League, as well as from the point of view of the Irish delegation especially.  The British did sign, and have since ratified. The terms in which they made the reservation, to which we took strong exception, ought to be known, and particularly the explanatory phrase used with regard to it.  They except disputes with the Government of any other Member of the League which is a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and of these they say that &ldquo;they shall be settled in such a manner as the parties have agreed or shall agree.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might question, however, what would happen if the parties had not agreed and did not agree in the future.  In relation to that we must consider the statement made by the British signatory: &ldquo;Disputes with other Members of the British Commonwealth <Col N="898" /> of Nations are excluded because the Members of the Commonwealth, though international units individually in the fullest sense of the term, are united by common allegiance to the Crown.  Disputes between them should therefore be dealt with by some other mode of settlement and for this provision is made in the Exclusion Clause.&rdquo;  I am not sure if such provision has been made. One can say that an arrangement has been made to allow some other tribunal to come into being but the sort of tribunal to be set up has not yet been agreed on.</P>
    <P>Finally, I desire to refer to comments which I have seen about that declaration and that signature&mdash; comments which proceed on a false basis and a false assumption.  Comments have been made as if our only purpose at Geneva should have been the fixing of the British delegation in a position in which they would have to have recourse to the Permanent Court of International Justice. These arguments proceeded further on the basis that that was the actual position and that therefore, so far as we allowed the British to make special reservations, we allowed them to get away from the position in which the previously found themselves, a position which was to our advantage.  Remember the truth, the facts of the matter.  Nobody was bound to accept the jurisdiction of the Court.  No Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations had signed it. The British had not signed it.  They, have now signed, but if they had not signed, the question of resort to the Court would not arise in relation to them.  They decided to take the step and to accept the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory.  They felt that they should not decide that without making certain reservations and, now that they have made these reservations, the question may have to be fought out as to how far these reservations are sound.  But people should not argue on the basis that before going to Geneva we could <Col N="899" /> have insisted on cases being brought to the Court at the Hague.  We could not have done so if the British did not sign.</P>
    <P>They did sign, and we contend that now, but only now, cases may be brought to the Hague.  They may have to be brought, but that is a very remote contingency, as we would pretty well exhaust every other means of securing a pacific settlement before going to the Court. We would only go there because we were disappointed in the other means suggested or because there was a defect in the law or because we were not satisfied in regard to the impartiality of the tribunal.  As it is, we have signed in a particular way and our signature binds us.  We believe that it is a signature which, under the circumstances, was the only one to which we could put our hand.  We accept ipso facto the jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice for a period of twenty years, and on the sole condition of reciprocity.  That is what we have signed, and we are moving towards ratification.  I, therefore, ask the Dáil to approve of the declaration accepting that signature and to recommend the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for the ratification of the declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side would be happy, too, if we could envisage the end of war, the end of disputes merely by a resort to arms, not alone for ourselves and our neighbours but for the world at large.  It would be a very happy day indeed if such an agreement could be arrived at, and nobody would be more pleased than the Deputies on these Benches.  Anything that would help to bring nearer that day, anything that would help to promote that atmosphere, anything that would help to bring any nation or all nations nearer to that <Col N="900" /> point of view&mdash;the settlement of disputes without recourse to arms&mdash; would have and will have our fullest sympathy and support.  The League has now been almost eleven years in existence.  As the Minister has just said, things have developed, perhaps not to the extent I imagine he thinks in that direction, in the direction of the acceptance by nations of peaceful methods of ending international disputes.</P>
      <P>They have developed to some extent in the right direction, but one of the things that does most in the world to promote strife, armaments and the growth of armaments, has not been curtailed at anything like the pace that one might have expected in the eleven years' history of the League of Nations.  However, the Minister confined himself fairly strictly to the motion before us and I will not develop the debate further on these lines beyond saying that the main purpose, as quoted by the Minister from the Covenant of the League of Nations, of the foundation of the League was the abolition of war, and to that end a reduction, if not the total abolition, of armaments has not progressed.  It might be said, I think, that, on the contrary, armaments have gone on increasing, increasing beyond what they were at any rate before the European War started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To confine ourselves to the Optional Clause, we are satisfied that the world is moving at perhaps too moderate and too slow a rate in that direction, and if future development on these lines enables us here in Ireland to settle international disputes without recourse to arms, we will be very happy.  Of course, we have our suspicious that when the time comes, as in recent years, it will not be a matter of settling peacefully by arbitration whatever disputes exist or may hereafter arise between ourselves and other nations.  We are suspicious that the same methods used in the past, the same pressure and the same means will again be tried.  As I say, if by agreement that method is put on the scrap heap we will be very glad. <Col N="901" /> We think, however, that it is rather soon considering the fact that the question of armaments remains in the state in which it does remain, to do anything more than to make the gesture which the Government have made in signing this Optional Clause. We would, as I say, be happy to see all armaments scrapped, if our neighbours would do likewise, not that we are such a big and powerful nation that we could go to war with any hope of victory through the strength of our armed forces over other armed forces, but small as we are and insignificant as we are, especially from the purely military standpoint, we think it would be unwise, unless similar declarations were made by our neighbours, that we should say that hereafter we will never have recourse to any methods which will include force.</P>
    <P>I still maintain our right to defend ourselves.  We are content and are happy, as I have said already, to see a development in the direction of a settlement of disputes, especially disputes in which we might be concerned&mdash;international disputes&mdash;by arbitration and by recourse to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  Any further development in that direction will all the better please us.  I was glad to hear the Minister state definitely that the first statement that was reported in the Press here as having been made by Mr. Henderson when he signed the Optional Clause on behalf of the British Government was not a correct one.  Small as the point is, it is of value to have the statement that was attributed by Reuter to Mr. Henderson repudiated.  The signing of the Optional Clause may be something of value.  That remains to be seen.  I think the Minister himself admits that.  It is possible that with the reservations which the British have put in, it may be only a gesture on our part and nothing more.</P>
    <P>It may be that if the matter does ever go to the Court to decide&mdash;and it is well to know that it is the Court that will finally have the interpretation of that clause&mdash;it may prove to be a gesture, or the signature may prove to have been something of <Col N="902" /> value.  But it is significant that the British took the opportunity to insist that disputes between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, so far as they were concerned, should not go to the Court. I agree with the Minister that every other means should be tried&mdash;every means other than going to war, first of all&mdash;and I am with the Minister again when he says every means other than forcing the issue with the International Court should be tried. We would be glad if the dispute that does exist and continues, the dispute with regard to our territory and our status that does exist and will continue to exist, should be thrashed out over the table.  We would like if means of that kind could be used with confidence by us in order to bring about a settlement of important questions.  There are certain questions that are bound to trouble this country, its people and its relations with its nearest neighbour, as long as they remain unsettled.  If there were opportunities and means &mdash;there are not at present&mdash;to settle these questions by a conference around a table, and if we could enter the conference with the confidence that these questions could be settled in that way, nobody would be better pleased than we.  We have yet to see such conditions exist as would give us confidence that such an arrangement would be come to with our neighbour and that there would be a possibility of arriving at a satisfactory settlement on these important matters.</P>
    <P>I take it then that the Minister is of opinion, and I take it that he is properly advised over it, that so far as he is concerned the conditions put in by the British are ultra vires.  Of course, as he has said, it is the International Court itself that must finally decide that issue.  But it is well to know that he and his advisors are of opinion that the conditions set down by the British when signing that Optional Clause that Mr. Henderson signed in October last, are not valid.  It is hardly likely that we would ever have any dispute with any member of the British Commonwealth of Nations but one&mdash;<Col N="903" /> the British themselves.  It is less likely that we would have disputes with any nation outside that community. We are a peaceful people. It is not likely that out of questions of commerce or trade disputes of an international character are likely to arise.  In considering this matter, therefore, we have to consider it in practice.  It brings itself down to the consideration of the relations between ourselves and the British nation and the possibility of arriving at some convention or some understanding which would avoid a recourse to arms at any time again between that nation and ourselves. Therefore, although there might be obstacles or bars in the way of having settled matters of dispute that might arise between ourselves and the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations who have signed that with similar reservations to that put in by the British&mdash;though such difficulties might arise, still that is a very remote possibility; and the conditions as put in by Canada, Australia or any other British Dominion, therefore, do not concern us. The condition put in by the British is certainly of importance.  It is doubtful, seeing that condition put in there, and knowing the strength of the British in the League of Nations and the influence that they would be able to exert in the International Court and on the members of that Court&mdash;it is doubtful if our interpretation or our case would result in a satisfactory finding for us. However, in principle we are satisfied that our case is a good one, and we should be prepared to let it go before any impartial International Court of Justice or any arbitration court.  We would be prepared to take whatever risks there might be in submitting to such a court.  We do realise that there are risks and that the influences against us would be very great.  But we have faith in the validity of our own case and in its justice and we would be prepared to take the risks of the submission of our case to an International Court or a body of arbitrators set up with our full approval.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> That is all I have to say on the matter.  Again, I would add that anything that could be done to promote the object of ending war, and the main objects of the League of Nations and its Covenant, would have our support.  We are not satisfied that all that might be done has been done by the League of Nations. We are not satisfied that the Great Powers, that are even now in conference to abolish or modify armaments, are doing all that might be done in conformity with their own signatures to the League of Nations' Covenant, the Kellogg Pact, and other things.  At any rate, if there were any sincerity in the declarations made on the matter by the nations, if there were any real attempt to bring about disarmament, the same disarmament that the Great Powers themselves have insisted on in the case of Germany, we will be happy. If we could be satisfied that there would be any real opportunity offered us to bring about a satisfactory settlement of our international disputes by peaceful means, nobody would be more pleased than we, and anything that can be done to bring about an atmosphere of peace in that direction, and bring us nearer the possibility of a settlement in that direction, will have our fullest support.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to listen to the pleasant and peaceful speech delivered by Deputy O'Kelly. He has created a very pleasant atmosphere in the discussion of this matter, an atmosphere very different to the stormy and more warlike atmosphere with which the Deputy was associated on previous discussions concerning external relations. The Minister is to be congratulated on having taken this decisive step in signing the Optional Clause without reservation.  There have been a lot <Col N="905" /> of critics of his action, particularly in Great Britain.  I notice that Sir Austen Chamberlain regretted that we had not made the same reservations as the other members of the Commonwealth.  I think there is one matter that was overlooked by our critics across the water; that is, that if they had followed our good example they would have the protection and the prestige of the International Court to see that we, irrespective of any change of Government, would not violate any of our undertakings to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the third reservation of the British Government, and although he stated that in the text of the Clause itself the Court had jurisdiction as usual in all international arbitration to decide the extent of its power and the tribunal's jurisdiction, still I do not know whether the British Government are agreed that their third reservation, as regards questions of purely internal concern according to international law, is governed by sub-section (b) of the Optional Clause, which states that all matters of international law are questions suitable for the decision of the Court, or, on the other hand, whether sub-section (b) of the Optional Clause is governed by reservation three of the British Government. I do not know whether that will ever arise.  I presume the attitude of our Government is that sub-section (b) of the Optional Clause governs the third reservation of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final recommendation I would make to the Minister is that now that we have set a good example in the Commonwealth by unreservedly accepting the jurisdiction of this Court for twenty years he should exert his good offices to see that we get a judge on this Court.  I understand that when any case is being tried, besides the permanent judges there is also one judge each from the contesting nations.  Mr. Justice Charles Doherty, who was Minister of Justice in Canada, some years ago introduced a Bill in the <Col N="906" /> Canadian Parliament to define the term &ldquo;Canadian National&rdquo; in order to ensure that Canada would have the right to appoint a permanent justice on the International Court. Under Article 3 of our Constitution that necessity would not arise so far as we are concerned, but I hope the Minister will keep in mind the desirability of obtaining at least one Irish permanent judge on the International Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we have heard from the Minister for External Affairs has not given us either an accurate picture of the events which led up to the signing of the Optional Clause by the Free State delegates or a clear statement of the policy of his Government in that respect.  The Minister informed us that this matter was discussed in 1926 at the Imperial Conference, at which time all the States associated in the British Empire were prepared to sign the Optional Clause but postponed doing so for the purpose of enabling the matter to be further considered.  I take it also that in 1926 the British Government and the British Dominions were prepared to sign that clause without reservation.  The question of the reservation could only have arisen within the few weeks prior to the actual date of signature.  If the question of the reservation was considered in 1926 or at any time between 1926 and 1929, then I think the speech which the Minister delivered in the Seanad when the matter was raised by Senator Johnson gave an entirely false impression of the situation.</P>
      <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did imply, if he did not definitely state it on that occasion, that there was never any question of a reservation such as was afterwards put forward by the British Government.  He stated the only reservation which might be considered was one relating to a period during which the acceptance would be valid, and a condition of reciprocity. The Minister should have <Col N="907" /> told us what happened between the Imperial Conference of 1926 and the meeting of the League Assembly in 1929 which involved this change of attitude on the part of the British Government.  Was the question of a reservation discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1926?  Was the question of a reservation discussed between the British Government and the Free State Government at any time before the Free State delegates went to the League Assembly in 1929?  If the question was discussed either in 1926 or subsequent to 1926, why did the Minister definitely convey that no question concerning the reservation had arisen when he was speaking in the Seanad in July of last year?</P>
    <P>We are going to support this motion because we think that the Free State Government did the right thing when they signed the Optional Clause on the sole condition of reciprocity, even though it is apparent from the speech of the Minister that they have since regretted having done so.  The action of the delegates in signing that Clause after a considerable delay without reservation must be taken, in view of the reservation of the other Dominions, as a declaration that in August last the Free State Government were of opinion that the Permanent Court of International Justice was a proper tribunal to adjudicate in inter-Dominion disputes.  Certainly those of us who thought about the matter when the report of the Free State delegate's action appeared in the Press came to the conclusion that that was the policy or the opinion of the Free State Government at the time.</P>
    <P>I will ask Deputies to consider this matter in relation to actualities. There is only one international treaty or agreement of any significance to which we are a party&mdash;that is the Treaty signed in 1921.  The only treaty which exists or is likely to exist between us and any nation outside the British Empire will be one relating to matters of trade and <Col N="908" /> commerce and in respect of which serious dispute is not likely.  Matters of dispute between us and Great Britain may arise and have arisen out of that Treaty of 1921, and we must consider this question in relation to that fact.  The Minister has stated that they were unable to convince the delegates from the other Dominions as to the advisability of signing this Clause without reservation. I am not concerned with the question of the validity of the reservation introduced by the other Dominions.  That is a minor matter, and any significance it had has since disappeared in view of the attitude which the Minister has taken to-day. The Minister stated that the delegates from Canada and South Africa signed the British reservation very reluctantly and under pressure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we recognised a certain relationship between members of the Commonwealth, and we would try to hammer out an agreement amongst ourselves.  We would try the ordinary methods of negotiation to see if they could be settled.  It might be a matter of Commonwealth importance, and I went on to say we must have a court in the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the cause of the disagreement that has arisen between us at the moment.  I agree the Minister did certainly say that before any matter was referred to the Permanent Court the method of negotiation would be tried, but he did not say that he was going to interpose between the Permanent Court and the Free State another Tribunal to adjudicate upon inter-Dominion disputes. The attitude that the Free State delegates took at Geneva and the attitude of which this Dáil is asked to approve in voting for this clause is one which can be supported by those who, while not accepting the Government's idea of the present status of Twenty-six Counties are nevertheless anxious to secure all the benefits which it is possible to secure from that position.  The <Col N="910" /> modified attitude of the Government, as revealed by the Minister here to-day, is one to which we cannot possibly give the same degree of support.  The Government, in my opinion, should have adhered to the attitude that they took at Geneva. They have not done so.  Within a few weeks after the delegates at Geneva signed the Optional Clause the Minister for External Affairs went to attend a meeting of the Imperial Conference Committee in London, and there agreed that an inter-Dominion Tribunal was desirable. The Report of the Committee reads as follows: &ldquo;We feel that our work would not be complete unless we gave some consideration to the question of the establishment of a Tribunal as a means of determining differences and disputes between Members of the British Commonwealth. We were impressed with the advantages that might accrue from the establishment of such a Tribunal.&rdquo;  They go on to explain that it would be impossible in the time at their disposal to define the constitution of such a tribunal.  But they recommend that the whole subject should be further examined by all the Governments.  That recommendation is signed by Mr. P. McGilligan for the delegation of the Irish Free State.  It is to be taken from that that the Free State have definitely decided upon the advisability of establishing an inter-Dominion Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of explaining his attitude upon that before the debate concludes; but let him not hedge or make use of sentences which are capable, obviously, of several interpretations, but let him tell us whether it is the policy of his Government to establish a court other than the Permanent Court at the Hague for the adjudication of inter-Dominion disputes.  Does he think it would be possible to arrange for an appeal from the inter-Dominion Court to the Permanent Court at the Hague, or will he tell us what is to be the relation between them?  The Minister signed the Optional Clause on the sole condition of reciprocity.  There was no suggestion made by him at the League Assembly that on the only matters in which international disputes were likely to arise the Free State Government were not going to invoke the aid of the Permanent Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude which the Minister has taken up did not, of course, come altogether as a surprise to some members of the House.  It was prophesied as early as September last by the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  He apparently knew then just what the Minister was going to do, although it is quite possible the Minister did not know himself. &ldquo;Having failed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to convince the Governments of the other Dominions that the Court of International Justice at the Hague would resolve their special difficulties more satisfactorily than the Privy Council the Free State Government, it is now learned, has decided to change its tactics by pressing for the constitution of an intercommonwealth court composed of judges drawn from all <Col N="912" /> the Dominions.&rdquo;  I do not object to the Government changing its policy provided it comes here and admits the change.  But when we have a motion here to approve of the action the Free State delegates have taken at Geneva last August, although the Government has since changed its attitude, we are entitled to get a fuller and franker statement than we have got from the responsible Minister. At present, I take it, inter-Dominion disputes can be settled either by the method mentioned by the Minister&mdash;the methods of negotiation&mdash;or by reference to the King in Privy Council.  The British Minister at Geneva, Mr. Henderson, defined the British Commonwealth of Nations as a group of separate international units united by their common allegiance to the British Crown, and the Minister now tells us that he recognised a certain relationship between the Free State and the other members of the Empire resulting from the Treaty of 1921.  I take it that this relationship to which the Minister referred is our common allegiance to the British Crown.</P>
    <P>Again let me say I would have much more respect for the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party if they came out into the open, as Deputy Esmonde came out last Saturday and announced their unqualified allegiance to the British Crown.  Instead of adopting that manly attitude, however, they attempt to confuse the issue whenever it arises and pretend that they can stand upon two stools at the same time.  Is it the view of the Government that the British Commonwealth of Nations, so called, consists of a number of international units united by a common allegiance to the British Crown?  If that is the view of the Minister for External Affairs and the President will they tell us at what particular date this allegiance to the British Crown became manifest in the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure. The Minister did certainly give that definition of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and he said that he recognised a certain relationship between the Free State and the other Dominions resulting from the Treaty of 1921. However, I do not want to press the point, because I have already said all I wanted to say in that connection.</P>
      <P>As a sort of apology for the change of attitude of the Government since last August, the Minister said that the case for the establishment of another tribunal to settle inter-Dominion disputes had not been made when he decided to sign the Optional Clause without reservation. If a dispute arose now, before the inter-Dominion Tribunal has been set up, and if the Government found themselves unable to settle that dispute by negotiation, what would be the position?  I think the Minister should make that clear. Disputes do exist.  Reference was made here to the dispute that arose over the question of the fishing rights on the Foyle.  References have also appeared in the Press concerning the dispute as to which Government is entitled to collect income tax arising out of the fisheries at Carlingford Lough.  If the Free State Government wish to resolve these disputes by negotiation, and find it impossible to do so, what will the position be?  Are we to take it that the Government are prepared to allow them to go for decision to the Privy Council until this inter-Dominion tribunal, suggested by the Imperial Conference Committee's report, has been established?  We have no information whatever concerning the Government's action or intention in these matters.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it would be in order to discuss here the attitude of the Executive Government to the British Privy Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, however, the Minister will make it clear what the position of the Privy Council in <Col N="914" /> relation to inter-Dominion disputes is, now that the Free State delegates have signed the Optional Clause without reservation and the British delegates have signed it with an invalid reservation.  I think the Minister should have devoted a greater part of his remarks to questions of that kind rather than giving us an undoubtedly interesting but otherwise useless history of the League in relation to the Permanent Court since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.  If the Free State has a direct interest in this matter it is in relation to a question such as this.  We cannot influence the course of world armaments. We can, however, do what we think is right.  The Minister referred to the signing of the Kellogg Pact, and said that the signing of the Optional Clause was the logical consequence of the signing of the Kellogg Pact. The nations that signed the Kellogg Pact, and the Optional Clause, agreed between themselves that in no circumstances would they resort to war for the purpose of securing the settlement of their differences.  I notice, however, the Minister has agreed with a number of the other nations concerned to sign a Convention, with some modifications, it is true, pledging the credit of this nation to finance war in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>If there is any significance in the Kellogg Pact, or any significance in the signatures which have appeared at the foot of the Kellogg Pact, surely action of that kind should not be necessary.  Perhaps this is going into a wider question than is justified, in view of the motion before us, but I do think we have either got to discuss this question in relation to general theories concerning world peace or in relation to its applicability to the actual position in which the Government of the Irish Free State now finds itself.

      <P>Deputy O'Kelly announced his agreement with my <Col N="915" /> point of view, that we ought to exhaust every means before we go to war, and even announced his agreement with my suggestion that we should exhaust every means other than the International Court to resolve disputes between ourselves and other members of the British Commonwealth of nations.  Deputy Lemass, I agree, is in violent disagreement with Deputy O'Kelly on that.  Deputy Esmonde raised a point about our having one of the judgeships.  I would not like to pronounce upon that at the moment. It is a matter which I will keep in mind.  He asked me a question with regard to Clause B of Article 36 of the Statute and its relation to the third reservation of the British.  The way our contention runs is this: The British have to sign, and sign adverting to all the points that are contained in Article 36.  If any reservation they put in is outside, say, this point that the Deputy referred to, Clause B, then the reservation falls to the ground.  Whether it invalidates the whole signature or not, is another matter.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand Deputy Lemass in a variety of his points.  He spoke of 1926 and made a lot of deductions as to the position of the various Governments in 1926.  He had the report before him, but he says he understands or implies or takes this for granted.  In some way, he arrives at the conclusion that we were all prepared then to sign without reservation at all.  I wonder where that is.  He went on to make a point about the reservations and asked why was I not frank with the Seanad.  He started with stating that in 1926 we were all prepared to sign the Optional Clause, and, he presumes, to sign it without reservation. Why did not he quote the text of the 1926 Report?</P>

      <P>The Report of the 1926 Conference.  Why did not the Deputy quote the Report.  It says: &ldquo;One question which we studied was that of arbitration in international disputes, with special reference to the question of acceptance of Article 36 of the Statute of the Per manent Court of International Justice, providing for the compulsory submission of certain classes of case to the Court.  On this matter we decided to submit no resolution to the Conference, but, while the members of the Committee were unanimous in favouring the widest possible extension of the method of arbitration for the settlement of international disputes, the feeling was that it was at present premature to accept the obligation under the Article in question.&rdquo; That is what the 1926 Report states.  They were unanimous in favouring the widest possible extension of the method of arbitration.  I specially said the feeling was that it was premature to accept the obligations under the Article in question. In my speech I said that that was not our attitude in 1926.  We felt the time was not ripe, and we were not insistent on it, because it did not seem a matter of practical politics at that time.  But to assume that we had Article 36 of the Court before us and that we were all agreed it should be signed without reservations is nonsense.  Where it comes from I do not know.</P>

      <P>Again, I would not like to take that as an accurate statement.  I do not know, because I did not go to all the meetings.  I was only over there for a period.  I do not know where the Deputy finds ground for his argument.  He said that we were all prepared in 1926 to sign without reservation.  The report shows what we were prepared to do in 1926.  We were prepared to pass some sort of Resolution.  The widest possible extension for the settlement of international disputes was favoured, but it was felt by the majority of those present that it was premature to accept the obligations of the Article in question. There is the Report.  The Deputy then goes on to the reservation.  He queried my speech.  He says I was not frank before the Seanad.  I wonder why I was not frank before the Seanad.  Senator Johnson quoted newspaper reports from political correspondents who were flying kites in England at the time.  Senator Johnson asked me which, if any, of these points was true.  I made a statement that I could not see that any of them could be true, because I could not see that any of the reservations there talked of fitted in with the Article, as we understood the Article of the Court.  I went on to indicate our attitude in general terms, that we recognised a special relationship, not a relationship of allegiance to the Crown, as between ourselves and the other nations of the Commonwealth, and that we would seek negotiations to try and hammer out agreements among ourselves. But I said that in the end there was the Court for us.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the British Government was prepared to sign in 1926.  I take it for granted that up to 1929 the British Government was prepared to sign the Optional Clause without reservation and that the question of reservation, therefore, only arose within a few weeks prior to the actual signing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refused to state that.  In 1929, when I spoke in the Seanad, the special question of reservation that came up afterwards at Geneva had not been raised.  I spoke my mind.  I spoke with a certain knowledge of what happened in 1926, and of despatches which had passed here about the Optional Clause before the signing of the Optional Clause simpliciter.  The Deputy was not content to ask the question and wait for an answer before he advanced his thesis.  He said I had not been frank with the Seanad.  Surely the implication was that I knew these reservations were coming but pretended not to know anything about them?  I did not know anything about them.  They were not before us until August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy further talked of the signature which, he said, we now regret.  I wonder where that comes from.  He talked of our modified attitude.  Again, I wonder where that comes from.  In so far as I stated our attitude&mdash;it is an attitude Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly has approved of&mdash;I stated in the Seanad that we would exhaust every possible means&mdash;other tribunals and other methods&mdash;rather than go to the Permanent Court of International Justice.  In July of last year, I remember there was a point raised on the Appropriation Bill.  Senator <Col N="919" /> Johnson raised the question of some reservations that were spoken of in the newspapers and asked me what truth there was in these things.  I said that we were not going to accept any reservations in connection with the signature which would reduce the signature to a farce. Speaking generally, I said what I stated here to-day.  I do not believe I have made one change.  I have not made a change in point of principle as between July and now.  I believe what we signed in Geneva was absolutely in accord with what I said on 17th July, 1929, and in what I said to-day there was no modification or change made.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to what has been said about South Africa and Canada and the Delegations at Geneva this year.  I understand that there was a certain dig at what Mr. Henderson said; that his words had not the meaning that they obviously bear. Mr. Henderson said &ldquo;Disputes with other members of the British Commonwealth are excluded because the members of the Commonwealth, though international units individually in the fullest sense of the term, are united by their common allegiance to the Crown.  Disputes between them should, therefore, be dealt with by some other mode of settlement and, for this, provision is made in the exclusion laws.&rdquo;  What does that mean? Does it mean that it was the view of the British Government at the time that disputes between the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations were not international disputes? Surely not.  They were, he goes out of his way to say, international units individually.  Can you have two nations, two entities that are called international units vis-á-vis each other, and can you have disputes between them that are not international disputes?  It is a fact that the British Secretary of State went on to say that some other mode of settlement should be used.  That point was brought out by two other delegations.  What did the South African say?  &ldquo;With regard to the reservation as to disputes between members of the British Commonwealth <Col N="920" /> of Nations, I wish to state that although in the view of my Government such disputes are justiciable by the International Court of Justice, my Government prefers to settle them by other means; hence the reservation.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  That disputes between South Africa and Great Britain are international but that they prefer to settle them by other means.  Take the Canadian declaration.  &ldquo;The Dominion of Canada has excluded from the purview of the Court legal disputes with other members of the British Commonwealth for the sole reason that it is its expressed policy to settle these matters by some other methods, and it has deemed opportune to include its will as a reservation, although a doubt may exist as to such reservation being consistent with Article 36 of the Statute of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the implication of that? Again, as far as the Canadians are concerned, disputes between Canada and the Irish Free State, or Canada and the British Government are really international disputes, and are justiciable, but it is the express policy of Canada not to have these brought before the Court.  Hence the reservation.  If there is anything that comes out of the reservations that were made by these two, and if there is anything that comes out of the fact that all of us signed, it is a clear demonstration of our international position. Nobody has thought fit to question that, and the mere fact of reservations being put in does not question it, especially when the reservations are put in in a sentence which declares that although international units in the fullest sense of the word these things should be settled in some other way.  Other people say they are justiciable; we prefer, as a matter of policy, to settle our disputes in this way, but nobody has taken it upon himself to say that we are not international units, and that the quarrels were not justiciable before the courts.</P>
    <P>As to the suggested tribunal, Deputy Lemass holds, because I signed the document which contained <Col N="921" /> the two sentences he read, that I have agreed to interpose a tribunal between ourselves and the Permanent Court.  Here is the great declaration: &ldquo;We felt our work would not be complete unless we gave some consideration to the question of the establishment of a tribunal as a means of determining differences and disputes between members of the British Commonwealth. We were impressed with the advantages which might accrue from the establishment of such a tribunal.&rdquo;  The Deputy left out the part which follows, which naturally deals with the type of the Court. We recommend the whole subject should be further considered by the Governments.  I certainly signed that.  It is alleged by Deputy Lemass that, because I signed, I have agreed to another tribunal.  It does not mean anything of the sort. It means what it says&mdash;that I have been impressed by the advantages that might accrue.  I think advantages would accrue.</P>
    <P>I think, in certain circumstances, there would be disadvantages.  I want to balance between one and the other until the situation shows me whether or not the advantages are greater than the disadvantages. Then I will make up my mind.  If the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages, we will plump for the Court of International Justice. What do we know about the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague?  In saying that, I am not decrying the Permanent Court of International Justice.  The members are very learned men, selected for their exposition of law, and on the basis that they are impartial. It is a very good Court, but we have no experience of it.  It is not so good a Court in its essence that there cannot be some other Court equally good or equally good for certain limited purposes. It is only when examination has proceeded for some time that one can see whether there is a handier Court, equally good for impartiality and justice.  What I said in the Seanad is what I still abide by.  I said in the Seanad that we ought to <Col N="922" /> have a Court of International Justice behind us, that we might have some sort of Commonwealth Conference, but on no account could we rule out the possibility of appeal to the International Court.  When the question of some other tribunal was mooted, we were impressed by the advantages that might accrue.  I have no hesitation in saying that great advantages might accrue.  They are clear, but we are not clear as to the disadvantages that might accrue. We are going to have the thing examined further, and we will be careful to make our decision at the proper time.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The main matters with which this Bill proposes to deal refer to the local government of the city of Dublin and to the proposed coastal borough and the occurrence of certain changes of a minor but not unimportant character as a kind of background.  It would be well that we should see these changes first and bear in mind certain dates.  First, there is the date of election, the date on which the new city council, the coastal borough council and new county council will be elected.  The next date to keep in mind is the appointed day, which will be fourteen days from that date.  Then we come to the 1st April, 1931, or, perhaps, the 1st April, 1932.  There are between the land boundaries of Dublin and the sea twenty-five bodies which deal in some way with local government matters.  Certain clearances will take place in this respect. In the first place the provisions of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, which superseded boards of guardians by boards of public assistance, and the further Act of 1925 which transferred the duties of rural district councils to county councils were held up in their application to the county and city of Dublin pending the settlement of matters relating to the local government of the city and county <Col N="925" /> following the Report of the Commission on the government of the city and county of Dublin.  It is proposed to apply those Acts now to the county, and the Boards of Guardians, namely, Balrothery, Rathdown, and the Dublin Union, will go out of office from fourteen days after the date of election.  For the present their places will be taken, so far as Balrothery is concerned, by a group set up by the county council to deal with the duties of the board of guardians in the present area.  A similar group will be set up by the new county council for Rathdown, and another group shall be jointly set up by the county council and the new city council in connection with the Dublin Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, rural councils disappear as from fourteen days after the date of election and their duties will be transferred to the county council or the board of health as the case may be which will be set up by the county council.  It is proposed to dissolve the Urban Councils of Rathmines, Pembroke, Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney. Arising out of that there will be further dissolutions, namely: the Joint Hospital Board of Rathmines and Pembroke; the Joint Drainage Board of Rathmines and Pembroke, and the Joint Drainage Board of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock. That will clear seventeen bodies in all.  There will be left in the county the new county council to be elected, the board of health which will be set up by the county council, the Town Commissioners of Balbriggan in connection with the elections for which there has been no change and the Urban District Council of Howth at present run by a commissioner and to be run by a commissioner to a date not later than June, 1931.  There shall be a coastal borough in connection with which there will be the Dean's Grange Cemetery Board, the Port Sanitary Authority concerned with Howth, Dun Laoghaire and the city as regards the prevention of sea-borne disease.  There will be the Port and Docks Board, the new County Borough of Dublin and the Grangegorman <Col N="926" /> Mental Hospital Board.  In all, there will be ten bodies left and if you add the three temporary bodies dealing with the duties of board of guardians in the county it will bring the number to thirteen.</P>
    <P>That is the background in regard to which changes in connection with the city of Dublin and the new coastal borough will take place.  It is proposed to extend the area of the city of Dublin and to take in the present Urban District Councils of Rathmines and Pembroke and certain rural areas specified in the Schedule.  It is proposed to set up a council of twenty-five and a City Manager to run the affairs of the city.  It is proposed to pool the debts and assets of the various bodies which will form the new city, and to have an equalised municipal rate with the stabilisation of certain rates in connection with Rathmines and Pembroke and the rural areas brought in in order to avoid any immediate increase in rates as the result of those areas being brought into the city.  The settlement of the present rates exemption, the rates that will be paid by bodies holding exemptions from municipal rates, will be on a certain percentage of valuation, so that the moneys paid in future will be comparable with the moneys paid in the past.  It is proposed to extend to the workmen in Rathmines and Pembroke the pension arrangements which at present apply to the workmen employed in the city of Dublin.  In connection with the coastal borough it is proposed to form such borough from the townships of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney without taking in rural areas and it is proposed to apply the same arrangement to that as applies in the case of the City Manager, the equalisation of municipal rates, certain exemptions in regard to land and the extension of the pension scheme to the workers in the coastal borough which exists in the city.</P>
    <P>In connection with these proposals we have to look back somewhat especially in regard to Rathmines and Pembroke, and then consider the present proposals in the <Col N="927" /> light of proposals made by the Commission set up to examine the position in the City and County of Dublin. I understand that it will be argued here, as it has been argued before the Commission referred to, that Rathmines and Pembroke should not be included in the city.  In respect to that, we have to look back. Prior to 1840, the area comprised in Pembroke formed portion of the Borough of Dublin, but on the revision of the boundaries of the Borough effected by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840, that area was excluded from the Borough and remained without any form of municipal government until 1863, when the area was formed into a township. The area of Rathmines and Rathgar appears never to have formed part of the Borough of Dublin and to have had no form of municipal government until 1847, when the area then known as Rathmines was constituted a township with an area of 930 acres.  The township was subsequently extended in 1862 by the addition of Harold's Cross; in 1866, by the addition of Sallymount and Rathgar; and in 1880 by the addition of Milltown.  From 1840 to 1847 Rathmines, and from 1840 to 1863, Pembroke, were under the jurisdiction of the Grand Jury of the County of Dublin.  In 1876 a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the state of the municipal government of towns and cities in Ireland, and after inquiry and the consideration of a report presented to them by W.P.O'Brien, an Inspector of the Local Government Board for Ireland, that Committee reported that a general inquiry into the subject of municipal areas should be undertaken and that a Commission should be appointed for that purpose. Accordingly, by warrant dated 31st October, 1878, the Lord Lieutenant appointed W.A. Exham, K.C.; W.P. O'Brien, an inspector of the Local Government Board for Ireland, and C.P. Cotton, C.E., as a Commission to inquire into the question of the extension of municipal boundaries.  This Commission is <Col N="928" /> known as the Boundaries Commission of 1878, and is sometimes referred to as the Exham Commission.</P>
    <P>Until this Commission was appointed no question of amalgamating Rathmines and Rathgar and Pembroke with the Borough of Dublin had arisen, but on its appointment the Corporation of Dublin petitioned the Commission to recommend the extension of the boundaries of the Borought to include the townships of Rathmines and Rathgar, Pembroke, Kilmainham, Drumcondra, Clonliffe and Glasnevin, and certain parts of the county of Dublin. A petition was also presented from certain ratepayers in Clontarf praying for the inclusion of the township in the Borough.  The Corporation did not make application for the inclusion of Clontarf, because they had considered that the township was separated from the Borough by a belt of agricultural land.  The Commission duly heard the case presented by the Corporation and reported that the boundaries of the Borough of Dublin should be extended to include the townships of Rathmines, Pembroke, Kilmainham, Drumcondra and Clontarf, and also certain portions of the county, mainly lying to the south of Rathmines and Pembroke.  No action was taken by the Legislature of the day on the report, and none of its recommendations were in consequence ever carried out.</P>
    <P>During the period from 1881 to 1898 the question of the extension of the boundaries of the Borough of Dublin became acute, and in 1898 the Corporation promoted a Bill for the inclusion within the boundaries of the Borough of the areas recommended by the Boundaries Commission. The Bill, with certain slight amendments, was passed by the House of Commons by a large majority, but on going to the House of Lords was amended by the exclusion of Rathmines and Rathgar and Pembroke.  On the Bill being sent back to the House of Commons with the Lords' amendments, the House of Commons refused to accept their amendments, the consequence being that the Bill was lost in 1899 through <Col N="929" /> the expiration of the then session of Parliament.  The Corporation, however, encouraged by their success in the House of Commons, reintroduced in 1900 the Bill as amended in the first instance by the House of Commons, and that Bill was-committed to a Joint Committee of both Houses, which, after a lengthy and exhaustive hearing of the evidence, rejected the claim of the Corporation for the inclusion of Rathmines and Rathgar and Pembroke.  The Corporation were perforce obliged to accept the amended Bill, which became the Act of 1900, under which Drumcondra, Kilmainham, Clontarf and certain portions of the County of Dublin were brought within the Borough. The Joint Committee which considered the Bill of 1900, made a special report to both Houses of the heavy burdens falling upon the City of Dublin to which the townships of Rathmines and Rathgar and Pembroke did not adequately contribute, and suggested that legislation should be proposed to Parliament to equalise those burdens.</P>
    <P>Following upon those recommendations, the Dublin Corporation promoted a Bill for the purpose, which became law under the title of the Dublin, Rathmines and Rathgar and Pembroke (Equalisation of Rates) Act, 1901, which provided for the equalisation of the rates over the city, Rathmines and Rathgar, and Pembroke, regarded as one area in respect of expenses incurred for the following purposes:&mdash;(1) Sanitary purposes under the Public Health Acts, excluding main drainage and water works: (2) public lighting; (3) streets, including maintenance and cleansing; (4) markets; (5) reformatory and industrial schools, and (6) lunatic asylums.  The justice of the case for including in the city area Rathmines and Pembroke was so apparent that although the British Legislature actually turned down proposals to include them the Joint Committee that dealt with them pointed out that these areas were so circumstanced with regard to one another there should be equalisation of rates in respect of some of these <Col N="930" /> matters.  It is worth recalling the points put up by the Dublin Corporation in 1879 as the grounds on which the inclusion of Rathmines and Pembroke should take place. They argued:&mdash;(1) That the townships were separated from the city by an artificial boundary only; (2) that persons living in the townships ought to be considered and in fact were almost as much citizens of Dublin as those living in the city; (3) that the city was included in a ring fence and could not grow; (4) that the townships are a continuation of and part of Dublin; (5) that the principal portion of residents of the townships were merchants and professional persons who used the city daily for their business purposes, but resided in the townships to avoid city taxation and to obtain the purer air there which they could not obtain in the city proper; (6) that the residents of the townships thus escaped all taxation necessary to maintain the city and avoided their proper share of responsibility for the efficient management of the city in and by which they made their living; (7) that Dublin City has been built up and cannot be extended otherwise than by including the townships and portions of the county; (8) that the artisan class and labourers who have built the houses in the townships and engaged in maintaing them live almost exclusively in the city, thereby increasing its expenses; (9) that the sanitary expenses of the city were increased by the number of tenement houses in the city in which the poorer classes live, and this expense is thrown exclusively on the city and unfairly benefits those who make daily use of their labour and services; (10) that the roads and streets of the city are used by the inhabitants of the townships, with its educational and other advantages, thus increasing expense for maintenance and seavenging; (11) that building materials and daily supplies of people in the townships are drawn from and through the city; (12) that the townships do not contribute to hospitals, etc., nor to the cattle market, abbatoir, etc.; <Col N="931" /> (13) that the repairing and seavenging of streets in the city and its sanitary condition is of immense importance to the inhabitants of the townships, who ought to contribute to its expenses and also to the increased charges of the city caused by the large number of poor people in the city; (14) that the townships fulfilled all the conditions upon which extension of towns has taken place in England as being suburbs or rather parts of the city and not merely suburban rural districts exclusively built on.</P>
    <P>That was the case made by the city of Dublin more than fifty years ago; that was made in 1901, after thirteen years of equalisation of rates as between Rathmines and Pembroke and the city in certain matters, by the Act that had to be introduced by the City of Dublin Corporation.  The whole proceedings, apart altogether from the cost of the inquiry dealing with the equalisation of the rates in 1901-1902, and again ten years after that &mdash;this whole inquiry and the whole prosecution of legislation in 1898 and 1901 cost the city of Dublin £50,000 without achieving the object that the city then thought should be achieved, and that the House of Commons in Great Britain, by a majority of three to one, thought should be achieved too.  However, that is, as I say, looking back.  What the House here has to decide, among other matters, in connection with this Bill is whether Rathmines and Pembroke are to be brought into the city.  The consideration of this matter was gone into by a Commission that inquired into the government of the city and county of Dublin, and it not only came to the conclusion that Rathmines and Pembroke should come in, but that the city should be given further extensions. I recall that matter to show the historical background to that position with regard to these two townships, because I understand it will be argued that these two areas ought not to come in.  Now we have to see what we are doing in relation <Col N="932" /> to the proposals of the Greater Dublin Commission.</P>
    <P>As against what we are proposing, the Greater Dublin Commission recommends that an area should be taken in to Greater Dublin that would extend from Malahide to Killiney; and that a great council should be set up over that area, and that inside that council representatives on that council from the coastal borough&mdash;that is, from the four urban districts of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey, and Killiney&mdash; should act as a council in dealing with certain matters of local interest which they describe in Schedule 3; and that in respect of the Pembroke area that representatives from Pembroke should act as an advisory council in regard to those local matters in Pembroke, and that representatives from Rathmines should act as an advisory body with regard to local matters dealing with Rathmines. But the rest of the council should deal with matters outside these areas&mdash;that is, matters dealing with the present city proper and the rural area that extends to Howth and Malahide.</P>
    <P>In approaching the proposals of the Greater Dublin Commission, I, as it were, took it that a case had been made for the green line, the boundary mark on the map of the Greater Dublin Commission's Report. I began the consideration of the matter from the point of view of the county.  I found that the acceptance of the Commission's proposal would leave us with a county with 29 per cent. of its present rural population and 28 per cent. of the valuation of the present rural area, and that it would place upon the County Council the problem of dealing with local government for that percentage of their present rural population, with 28 per cent. of their present rural valuation as their financial foundation, and that they would have to carry out the administration of local government over 85 per cent. of their present rural areas. It appeared quite clear that what we would have surrounding our metropolitan area would be a new Leitrim with twice as many people only per <Col N="933" /> acre as there are in Leitrim, with twice the valuation per person that Leitrim has, and with an area more effectively divided off in the middle by the City of Dublin than Leitrim is by Lough Allen.  I convinced myself that the conduct of the local government of the County of Dublin would be impossible under such conditions. But still accepting that I would find that a case was made for the satisfactory carrying out of local government by accepting the green line, I considered that perhaps the remaining portion of the County of Dublin should be divided; that North County Dublin should be thrown into Meath, and that South County Dublin should be thrown into Wicklow, and that instead of three county councils we would have two county councils to carry on the work.  It was clear on the financial side that the rates in North County Dublin could be comparatively considerably reduced, and that the rates in Meath would rise to a small extent.  In so far as it was possible to carry out an examination on purely theoretical grounds, the rates in North County Dublin would be reduced by 2s. 6d., and the rates in Meath raised by 1s.  That is accepting that there were no economies effected in the doing away with the extra county council.  As far as South Dublin was concerned, the rates there might be reduced by 1s., and the rates in Wicklow increased by 1s.  But when I came to consider an administrative change of that kind, and even a social change of that kind, and the political effects of a change of that kind, then I was driven back to consider what were the interests of the citizens of Dublin, or the citizens of any townships, that would warrant making changes of that particular kind.</P>
    <P>After very, very careful consideration of the matter we were driven to the conclusion that the proposals set out by the Greater Dublin Commission for dealing with the local government of the city and urban districts and rural districts which they proposed to take in were not satisfactory and that in practice when it came to be worked out they <Col N="934" /> did not provide as effectively for the proper carrying on of the business of the people as a different method might.  Just as it is very much in our own minds, it was uppermost in the minds of the members of the Greater Dublin Commission that Dublin was extending and would extend. But due to the fact that Dublin is extending there is a certain burden thrown down on the city. There is a burden thrown down for supporting the loans for the further extension of water, drainage and housing, and it is essential that while bearing these burdens that these burdens would not be made unnecessarily great by stretching them out too much.  Where objection can be found to the setting up of the greater council and the taking in from Malahide to Killiney is on the grounds, in the first case, that the local government problem presented there is not a homogeneous one.  The council dealing with that area could never get their minds clear that they were dealing with an urban problem, because too much of that rural area would be brought in.  Arising out of the want of homogencity of the problem presented to them, the representation proposed was wrong.  The representation proposed in the Commission's Report would give 108,000 local government voters in the old City of Dublin, 35 representatives, while giving half of that number or 54,000 local government voters in the rest of that area 30 representatives. The representation system then arising out of want of homogeneity of the problem is wrong.  I do not believe the council control could be worked.  You were to have a great council dealing with all different matters set out in Schedule 2 of the Report, 34 items.  The items set out in Schedule 3, that is, cleansing of roads, street surfacing public lighting, provision of standards and lamps, abattoirs, markets, domestic seavenging, public sanitary conveniences, public baths, wash-houses, and local amenities such as parks, pleasure grounds, piers and promenades, were to be the peculiar responsibility of the local councils.  You would <Col N="935" /> have certain matters discussed locally in the coastal borough, and certain matters discussed locally in Pembroke and Rathmines but no local discussion for Howth, Malahide and Raheny beyond general matters dealt with in the council.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have seen recently where a meeting of citizens was held in Dun Laoghaire with regard to the wants of Dun Laoghaire, and they may have seen that a fortnight or so before a meeting asking for the formation of a north coastal borough was held by persons interested in the Howth, Malahide, Baldoyle and Sutton side.  The discussion that took place at these meetings, and the very calling of these meetings, shows another great objection to the Greater Dublin Commission proposals. The bringing of these areas into the city on the grounds that they were growing and developing, and that they ought to be provided with services of a particular kind, raised extravagant hopes in the minds of the people of these not yet urbanised areas that they are going to be provided with very great services.  For instance, the Baldoyle, Sutton and Howth people want a main drainage scheme analogous to that of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire, and the Government is supposed to pay for it.  They want a big road scheme from Malahide to the city, and the Government is supposed to pay for it.  In the same way slum clearing and houses are wanted in Dun Laoghaire.  Coastal area roads are wanted; improvements on the sea front and general improvements in the amenities of the seaside resorts are considered necessary, all involving a big amount of money which is to come from somewhere else than the areas in question. If these areas are brought into the city there is no reason why there should be Government assistance to provide drainage for Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle similar to that which the Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire people have had to pay for in their own areas.  Similarly, the Pembroke and Rathmines people have had to pay for theirs, <Col N="936" /> and the Dublin people have had to pay for their own.</P>
    <P>What we want to provide in the proper development of the Dublin area is the widest flung area that can be satisfactorily administered, and that will contain a homogeneous circumference.  With that in our minds we have considered that the most satisfactory area for the Dublin county borough is the city, Rathmines, Pembroke and certain rural areas that we have fully examined and marked out.  A number of the rural areas that it has been often suggested should come into the city on the grounds that they were urbanised, or were being rapidly urbanised, were found in fact to have been diminishing in population between 1911 and 1926.  The areas that we have proposed to come into the city are areas where definite urbanisation has taken place.  In so far as is possible we have not divided townlands, but in three cases as far as the city is concerned we have divided townlands for the reason that the townlands were large and if the whole of them were taken in we would have taken in rural areas that did not appear to be required for development for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Turning then to the coastal borough there is the fact that if the four urban districts along the coast were taken from the county council, the county council administration would be made exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, and the burden that would be thrown on the people would be very much increased.  Apart altogether from that fact, we have had to come to the conclusion that the coastal borough is a separate place from the city in the whole outlook at the present moment.  Their heart is the seafront and their whole life has grown up around the seafront. In so far as services are required for them, the services that would warrant joining in, taking their present position, would be that they would require water from the city or drainage from the city or that they would require roads.  As far as water is concerned they have it at present and they are paying a <Col N="937" /> satisfactory price to the city for it. As far as drainage is concerned, Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire have their own drainage, and under no circumstances can that drainage be linked up with the city drainage; it is a separate system in itself. Dalkey would require some additional drainage service and Killiney has not a drainage service at the moment.  The drainage services there will have to be improved.  But Dublin City cannot help Killiney or Dalkey by taking their drainage into the Dublin drainage system.</P>
    <P>No case can be made in the matter of roads for requiring the linking up of the two areas because the machinery for dealing with the city as a compact area&mdash;the road making machinery&mdash;will be organised for that area economically.  Additional road making control would be wanted in the coastal borough and the advantage, if any&mdash;and it is doubtful if there would be any advantage&mdash;of joining up the coastal borough to the city for the purpose of having joint control of roads would not be such as to outweigh the disadvantage that would otherwise arise, the disadvantage being that at the present moment the problem that the new Council of the City of Dublin will have before them in settling down for their new administration will be to direct all their attention on the city and the city's peculiar problems, which are different from the problems of the new coastal borough.  The residents in the coastal borough could hardly expect to get that close attention from the city at present that they would get from their own council.  The representation of the coastal borough, if brought into the city, as I have shown, could not be satisfactory either, and the general affairs of the coastal borough in its present state of development and the present state of development of the city can best be left in our opinion to itself.</P>
    <P>The question arises from the Dublin point of view for what purpose does Dublin City want the coastal borough attached to it? What advantage can it be to it?  I know of no advantage that it can be <Col N="938" /> to the citizens of Dublin to bring in the coastal borough and to make the Dublin Council responsible for the administration of its affairs.  I should like to see it shown that it would reduce the rates in Dublin by a halfpenny in the £.  What Dublin really wants in any reorganisation is the proper settlement of efficient management there, and that it will have fairly satisfactory powers of extension.  The city is prevented from extending over to the sea by an angle of about 69 degrees.  It is prevented from extending down against Blackrock by an angle of about fourteen or fifteen degrees, and of the 360 degrees in four right angles, it has about 280 degrees in which it can extend.  As far as the extension of the city is concerned, the last place that the city would decide to extend itself is down to or at the back of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire.  If extension is going to take place there, it can most satisfactorily be controlled from the Dun Laoghaire side at the present moment. When further extension does take place, then the question of whether the joint interest will be served by amalgamating the two areas can be considered.  Bearing in mind that the urbanisation is going on round the forceps of Dublin Bay, we have introduced a provision into the Bill by which if either the council of Howth or the council of the city, or the council of the coastal borough consider an extension is wanted, they can make application for such extension as they want.  An inquiry can be held by the Local Government Department, and such extension as a case is made for can be made the subject of a provisional order which can be passed through this Oireachtas.  So that there will be a systematic and easy way of extending the area that will be controlled by the urban authorities around the Bay, and the process of urbanisation going on gradually there can go on under the public eye with a thorough sensing by the councils responsible for the administration of the area, and by the people as regards the joining up of further urban areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> As regards not taking rural areas into the coastal borough, a private measure was introduced in 1924 by the Urban Councils of Blackrock Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey for joining these three areas into a borough.  No proposals were made in that measure for the extension of the boundaries of the borough.  No provisions, so far as I recollect, were inserted in the measure giving power in a simple way for extension.  If there was an urgent pressure on the local bodies for extension, they would, I submit, have made some kind of provision in their Bill for it. If Deputies will look at the map prepared by the Greater Dublin Commission and look at the road stretching from Temple Hill up to Cabinteely and Loughlinstown and see what urbanisation is going on there, I think they will be convinced that there was no case for bringing that area into the borough.  Of the forty-three townlands which it was proposed should be included within the boundary line of the coastal borough, twenty-six have a population of less than one per acre, and fourteen of these have actually decreased in population since 1911.  I submit that the House may leave it to the local authority, planning for their own area and looking at their problem, to say whether further extension of their boundary is necessary in order properly to look after the interests of the citizens of these districts.</P>
    <P>Part of Deputy O'Connell's amendment takes exception to there not being provided in the Bill a local authority of any kind for dealing with matters common to the metropolitan area as a whole.  I am sure the Deputy will give us an idea as to what he means.  I submit that the new city, the new borough, and Howth, with simple powers of extension, give you all the chances for growth that are desirable.  The next thing that is required, if you want something else besides the Department for Local Government to control that growth by inquiry, is what would be called a town-planning or regional planning board.  I do not know if that is what the Deputy has <Col N="940" /> in mind.  If that is so, I should like to know what town-planning is for. Exception has been taken in other places to the fact that there is no provision for town-planning in this measure.  When we deal with legislation for town-planning we want to be quite clear in our minds what the object of it is.  The object, I suppose, that Deputy O'Connell and others have in mind is that proper steps should be taken that there would be a reasonable and co-ordinated development of roads, drainage services, and all that, in the areas outside.  What we want for that is a clear conception of a regional plan.  We want legislation for that, and I submit that no body ought to be established to look after regional planning in a frame of mind of wanting over-organisation for greatness sake.</P>
    <P>For some months, I have had the Department examining the problem of town planning so that it can be dealt with, but certain problems have to be solved before it can be effectively dealt with.  There is no use in introducing legislation that will not thoroughly realise these problems and that will not deal with them, not only in a theoretical way, but in a practical way.  As I say, the situation has been thoroughly examined, but I think regional planning outside the city and into the county should be for the purpose of serving the interests of a growing city and the city council comes into that.  As it is regional planning extending into the county, it brings in the county council.  If any body is going to act as an advisory body for regional planning in the County Dublin, in my present frame of mind, with the problem not fully examined, and not having come to the stage at which we can put legislation before the House, I see no other body but one such as this: The Lord Mayor of Dublin and one or two of the city councillors; the chairman of the county council and perhaps one member of the council; the mayor of the coastal borough and, say, one member of the coastal borough, and the chairman of the Urban District Council of Howth. <Col N="941" /> Such matters as require to be dealt with or to be examined for the purpose of seeing what regional development is and the preparation of plans would require a body like that. If Deputies are looking for the establishment of a local authority of a kind for dealing with matters common to the metropolitan area as a whole, if they want any other body, I should like to know what body they want, and what things they have in mind as common to the area as a whole.  So much with regard to we submit to the House as the most satisfactory areas that can be set out.</P>
    <P>Next we come to the proposal that there be associated with the councils governing these areas a manager&mdash;a manager for the City of Dublin and a manager for the coastal borough. A considerable amount of talk has been indulged in to the effect that in providing for the appointment of a City Manager our Bill is subversive of representative government.  Deputy O'Connell, in his amendment, objects to the Bill on the ground that it deprives the citizens of effective control over the administration of their municipal affairs.  The history of local government is the history of the devolution of the powers of the central government to locally-established authorities arising out of the necessity of meeting local or national needs as they arose.  In the first instance, they were confined to certain aspects of the poor law.  Gradually they grew, and they grew from time to time in a haphazard way and, in consequence, the local government organisation has grown up in a haphazard and piecemeal way and not in pursuance of any organic conception of the function, broad and comprehensive in its scope, under which the orderly and progressive expansion of local government services and machinery could be co-ordinated and secured.  That devolution of power has proceeded at a great pace during the last thirty years and has resulted in a system under which an ever-increasing complex mass of administrative and deliberative functions has been devolved upon local authorities without sufficient consideration being <Col N="942" /> paid either to the question of their capacity or the ability of the machine to deal adequately with those functions.  In view of the importance of the proper exercise of local government functions to the welfare of the community and of the financial effects of bad and uneconomic management, it has become of paramount importance to secure the utmost efficiency in execution by local authorities of their powers and duties.  Local government is dynamic &mdash;it cannot stand still.  It is continually adapting itself or being adapted by the legislature to new functions imposed upon it.  A tribute must be paid to the efforts of those public-spirited members of local authorities who, caught up in a complexity of system which it would require years of study adequately to understand, have grappled with the problems of local government and endeavoured, with very considerable success and with limited means at their disposal, to secure the efficient local government of their areas.  A point, however, appears to have been reached at which, in the interests of better local government, a separation of the deliberative and administrative functions of local authorities is desirable, particularly in reference to the larger municipalities, where the complexity of function is most apparent, and large financial matters are concerned.  It is conceived that such a separation would be entirely in accord with modern democratic theory and practice.  Such a separation should ideally take place on the lines that the purely administrative and executive functions of local government should, in an important local government area such as a large municipal borough, be entrusted to an expert officer capable of co-ordinating and controlling the management of the local government business of the authority.  That officer must necessarily be invested with all the necessary powers for that purpose and be responsible to the local authority for the satisfactory discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of this Bill, as it was the aim of the Cork Bill, to devise such a system of separation of <Col N="943" /> powers for the City of Dublin, the capital city of the country.  Modern theory and practice both concur in the view that the expert administrator is a necessary institution in local government required for the dispassionate consideration and solution of local government problems. Admittedly the problem is to secure the proper demarcation of functions between the expert administrator and the local government body. Such demarcation should apparently follow the lines which separate the deliberative functions of the local authority from their purely administrative functions.  We have in this country progressed very far in the matter of improving our machinery for local government.  We have progressed that far because, I think, there has been a general appreciation not only in the different parties in the country, but throughout the people of the country as a whole, of the lines upon which the main local government machinery should be formed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we may say another word or two upon the matter, I did, but I did not receive the slightest suggestion as to what additional powers are wanted.  I have informed the Cork Corporation that I will be delighted to see them when I have heard from them what additional powers are required by them. As I say, there is common appreciation through the country, I find, of the lines upon which improvement in the fashioning of the local government machine is necessary.  Going into the matter, the Greater Dublin Commission proposes, in fact, what <Col N="945" /> we have attempted to provide in Cork, a City Manager that will deal with the executive and the administrative side of what the council wants to do.  We can look in a few moments at what difference there is between what we are proposing here and what is proposed in the Commission. What we are trying to do, and trying to do, not as a matter of theory but trying to do on the practical side, is to find out what exactly the reserved functions are that ought to be reserved to the council in order that they may control local policy and local development and to keep them from interfering in what should be the functions of their chief administrator, because we have got to realise this, that the proper carrying on of the services for democracy must mean that with the non-expert democratic elected body you must associate the expert, and you must give the expert independence that will enable him to carry out the work that the democratic body wants. That does not mean that you set up a democratic body and an expert in order that the expert will flout the democratic body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is occurring in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is occurring in Cork.  I have heard a lot more about it.  But that is what is necessary, that you have your expert to work out the policy of the democratic body and that he be not interfered with.  We have no provisions in our Bill for making it a misdemeanour if a member of the council interferes with the Manager in carrying out his business but so keenly did the Greater Dublin Commission feel on the matter and so clearly did they realise that it must interfere with the interests of the people if the Manager is interfered with unnecessarily that they would propose to make it a misdemeanour for a member of the council to interfere with the Manager except in a formal way in the carrying out of his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So what we are concerned with in this legislation, whether dealing with <Col N="946" /> the Dublin Bill, with the members of the Oireachtas or with the Cork Bill, with the elected members of the Cork Council, is to find out not as a matter of theory but from the actual practical working point of view what the division exactly of functions should be.  The Commission proposed, as far as the Manager is concerned, that the Manager should have an advisory council.  The present Bill provides for the appointment of a Manager.  The Commission sets down the different classes of directors there might be but the Manager must be the responsible person and I cannot see a more satisfactory advisory council for a Manager than the heads of the different services.  For instance I would have the Manager deal directly with the head of the Engineering Department; I would have him deal directly with the head of the public health services. I would have him deal directly with the treasurer in the matter of finance.  I would have him deal directly with the solicitor.  These high officials, responsible for their own big departments should be the persons, if any, in my opinion, who ought to be the members of any advisory council.  They are, in fact, the persons that the Manager will deal with and, if it is necessary, in the actual working out of the organisation under the Manager, that some other layer of responsibility ought to come in between him and the heads of these services then that is a matter for organisation, for the Manager in the carrying out of his responsibilities, in organising his machinery to arrange for such persons but I would not undertake to suggest in the Bill that, as well as having a Manager, we should, by statute, also say there shall be directors.  There would have to be heads of special services.</P>
    <P>On the question of the necessity for the Manager the total expenditure of the old City of Dublin for the year 1927-28 was £1,797,000.  It is probably the biggest business in Dublin.  It is a complex business and requires capable and, shall I say, independent management.  When you appoint a Manager and make <Col N="947" /> him independent of interference in the actual carrying out of his business you do not put him in a position to flout the authority or question the decisions of the council in which these matters of policy are concerned. It is absolutely essential, if you are going to have clear disinterested, efficient work that the Manager, be in an independent position for carrying out his duties. Even he requires to be independent in order to avoid the danger of being corrupt, so that when Deputy O'Connell argues that the present Bill deprives citizens of effective control over the administration of their municipal affairs I want to know does he object to a City Manager, and if he does not object to a City Manager what does he object to in this Bill with regard to the position proposed for a City Manager?</P>
    <P>The council to be associated with the City Manager in the city and in the coastal borough is a small council.  Carrying on the affairs in the city is a practical matter.  Any Deputies who have any experience of the discussion of intricate matters in large councils will know how impossible it is to get clear, accurate, responsible discussion where there are a number of people present who are not taking part in the discussion. The number suggested for the council in the city is twenty-five, and the number suggested in the borough, fifteen.  As far as the number suggested in the borough is concerned, that matter has been the subject of discussion between myself and the representatives in the borough, who put forward the Private Bill in 1924.  I think we have come to fairly amicable conclusions that fifteen for the borough will serve the purpose of that area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember in dealing with the Cork Bill that one thing that I was very anxious would not happen would be that Cork would be split up into wards, and that the new city council would be a city council that had a ward mentality.  We proposed to make the coastal borough one electoral area, and we <Col N="948" /> propose in the city that the city will be divided into three electoral areas. With regard to the council in the city it is proposed that there shall be twenty-one elected on the ordinary local government franchise, and that there shall be four elected on a special franchise, and this special franchise has been questioned as giving votes to property.  Deputy O'Connell, in his amendment, suggests that the Bill should be rejected because it introduces the undemocratic precedent of conferring a special franchise, rights and privileges based on the possession of property. The local government franchise is based upon the occupation by a person of full age of rated premises.  We will say that having established the fine industry that he has established in Cork, Mr. Henry Ford sent another detachment of his organisers to Dublin, and organised an aeroplane factory that was giving employment to as many people making aeroplanes in Dublin as there are employed making motors in Cork.  Deputy O'Connell would regard it as undemocratic and as conferring special privileges upon the possession of property if the firm that were employing 6,000 people in the City of Dublin were given a local government franchise while the caretaker who may be living in the lodge of the works had a vote for himself and another for his wife if she were over thirty years of age.  I do not know whether the Deputy wants to argue that the present local government franchise is the last thing in democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The present local government vote is based on the occupation of rated premises. The total valuation of the old City of <Col N="949" /> Dublin was £1,227,683.  That is supposed to be the basis of the local government vote, but of that amount more than half, £628,847, is the valuation of business premises in the city.  We are in the position that the tendency is for private persons running a business to become a company, even if we only refer to the ordinary individual.  But when we turn to the big firms in the city giving, in commercial or manufacturing ways, employment, we are in the position that, although these firms have to pay a large amount of rates, a very high valuation in respect of premises not occupied as a matter of enjoyment of property but for the purposes of the carrying on of the life energy of the city by giving employment here, they have no franchise in respect of the rates they pay.</P>
      <P>The question arose before the Greater Dublin Commission, and they recommended that votes be given to companies.  The question arose rather late in the day when dealing with the Cork Bill.  On going into the matter it seemed to be clear that the giving of a vote in respect of premises valued, say, at £1,000 or £500, and employed for the purpose of giving employment, was not a fair kind of equality with the giving of a vote to a person living in an ordinary house and using the house for living in simply.  We felt, in order to be effective in the first place, that some other method had to be adopted and that there was another side to the case.  Men engaged in business are very much immersed in their own affairs and do not go in for either national or municipal politics, and the work that they are doing is quite as necessary for the life of the people as the carrying on of local or national government. We must all realise that to a certain extent a man's first duty is to provide for himself and his dependents. He can be excused for engaging in his business for the purpose of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to realise that local government has to be carried on and that if the local government of the <Col N="950" /> City of Dublin is not properly carried on, the carrying on of ordinary business in the city is going to suffer.  We felt that by giving a special franchise of a very limited kind to those people who paid rates on property, used by them not for occupation pure and simple, but for the purpose of giving employment, that a certain limited number of places on the council would be given to them, in the first place, in respect of the valuation of the property, the valuation of property being the basis of local government franchise.  In the second place, we wanted those people, who are engaged in the business, commercial and manufacturing life of the city not to shut their eyes entirely, or to the extent which a large number of them have been doing, to the proper carrying on of the business of the city.  If Deputies on the Labour Benches see the outraging of democratic rights in extending to persons occupying premises for business purposes a franchise of this particular kind, I would like to have it explained. I would like to have explained also whether we do or do not want in the councils of our municipalities men who are highly skilled, but who are so very much immersed in commerce and manufacturing business that they will not turn to the task of facing the ordinary electorate for local government election purposes.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy would get the draftsman to agree with him that slums come within the description contained in the Bill.  From my point of view, if the Deputy can argue that the description of business premises can be interpreted as including slums, I will see that slums are taken out.  The Deputy cannot deny that the commercial, manufacturing and industrial work in this city is providing the life blood of the city, and that there would be no local government necessary if it were not for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides certain financial <Col N="951" /> adjustments as between the present bodies and the bodies that are being absorbed.  In the first place, in the city, to which will be added Rathmines, Pembroke and some rural areas, it is proposed that the assets and the debts of the various bodies will be pooled.  That is a common practice in the association of existing bodies with one another to form a new unit.  There is no other way, and it has never been possible to find another way of solving the matter.  One area may have a burden of debt simply for the reason that they have laid down their roads or drainage, whereas another area which has been joined with it may have no debt, for the reason that its roads and drainage are in a bad condition; but generally when new areas are created, they are brought together because their interests are common interests. The services provided in each area have to a certain extent been commonly used by the people of those areas and there is a fair case for pooling the assets and the debts. As a matter of fact there is no other practicable way of dealing with the matter.  In the City of Dublin at present there are thirteen different rates.  The authority for these different rates comes from different statutes, many of them private statutes.  The incidence of some of these rates is different and the method of recovering them in the Courts is different.  The Bill proposes amalgamating all these rates in the municipal rate.  The simplicity of the arrangement will be very great and the economy and general convenience of it will be much greater than can be imagined.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the case of the new city to stabilise the rates for Rathmines and Pembroke for a period of five years at the figure for the present year.  The present rate in Pembroke is 12/4, and in Rathmines 12/8.  The present rate in the city is 14/8.  It is proposed to stabilise these rates in Pembroke and Rathmines at the present figure in so far as they are not increased by poor law charges.  The reason for <Col N="952" /> making a distinction for poor law charges is that there has been an additional burden put on the rates in respect of poor relief of the able-bodied since these rates were struck, and it is reasonable that Rathmines and Pembroke would pay their normal charge in connection with that matter.  In the same way it is proposed to have a flat municipal rate for Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey and Killiney.  It is proposed to stabilise the Killiney rate at its present figure of, I think, 12/8 or 12/4, as against 14/8 and 14/4 in the other places.  The rate in Killiney will be stabilised for a period of five years, but there are certain exceptions of a particular kind in the city and in the boroughs confined to land and railways.</P>
    <P>In the city there are certain classes of property indicated in the Schedule of the Bill, and it is proposed with regard to these properties, that while they will be rated on the full municipal rate, they will pay the full municipal rate only on a certain percentage of their valuation.  The reason for this is that, if we take the case of railway companies, the following rates are paid in full: poor rate and criminal injuries.  The domestic water rate is not paid in full, the rates for measurement or dead walls are not paid, and the following rates are paid on a quarter of the valuation only: the improvement rate, the district sewer rate, the grand jury rate, the domestic water rate, the borough rate, the library rate, the public water rate, and the police rate.  In previous consolidations of this particular kind it has been the practice to continue in existence the enactments giving these exemptions.  The result has been to detract from the advantage of consolidating the rate.  We have estimated the percentage actually paid by the bodies in question for a period of five years.  We have taken that amount as a percentage of what they would have paid if they paid the full rates, so that we may get rid of the old enactments and the old different rates.  We propose that they will be assessed at a flat municipal rate <Col N="953" /> according to the percentages that are given there.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to land is somewhat different.  There has been no exemption in regard to land in some of the urban districts, but we propose that there will be exemption of one-half of the rate on land generally.  The Bill proposes that the fact of amalgamation and the fact of a transfer of officers from a body to its successor shall not be taken as a cause for going out on pension.  It makes adequate provision for the pensioning of redundant officers, and it gives a year for clearing up the situation in regard to officers.  It may be necessary to extend that period.  As I stated before, the Bill provides that the workmen in the new city and the new borough will have extended to them the advantage of pension, sick leave, and other privileges which the present Dublin Corporation staff of workmen have.  In so far as by-laws exist in these areas they will continue to exist until they are either extended or revoked by the bodies which succeed the present bodies.  Generally both as regards the extension of the area suggested here, as regards the money and as regards the franchise, we are putting forward proposals to the Oireachtas that we consider are the best proposals that can be put up for the satisfactory carrying on of the local government of the City and County of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and to substitute the words: &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to a measure dealing with the local government of the City and County of Dublin which fails to establish a local authority of any kind for dealing with matters common to the metropolitan area as a whole, which deprives citizens of effective control over the administration of their municipal affairs, and which introduces the undemocratic precedent of conferring special franchise rights and privileges <Col N="954" /> based on the possession of property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As stated by the Minister, the Bill before us makes provision for the local government of Dublin City and County, and to a certain extent, therefore, it might be considered as being of comparatively small importance to Deputies who do not represent a constituency within the city or county concerned.  There are special reasons, however, why this measure should have more than local interest for every Deputy in the House.  Not alone the citizens of Dublin, but the people of the whole State are concerned, and should be concerned, and take a deep interest in their metropolitan city.  Anything that tends to make or mar the city should have an interest for all the citizens of the State.  The elected representatives of the city will, no doubt, have special responsibilities thrust upon them in connection with the Bill, but it is the duty of every Deputy to take a special interest in the progress of the measure and to look at it, not alone from the narrow, local municipal point of view, but from the point of view of the country as a whole.  It is possible, perhaps, that those of us who do not represent any constituency in the city or county are in a position to take a more detached view of the measure than Dublin Deputies and have more regard to its broader aspects and the general principles embodied in the Bill.  So far as the amendment which I have moved is concerned, I have not considered the Bill from the purely Dublin standpoint.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Dáil to reject the motion for the Second Reading on the three main grounds which I have stated in the amendment, which were referred to by the Minister in the course of his speech, and which I shall briefly cite as follows.  There is the failure to entrust the management of the affairs which are common to the metropolitan area to one governing body.  Thus we have a representative council set up under the Bill which has no effective control, and which I hope to show <Col N="955" /> will have no effective control over urban or municipal affairs.  The third reason is because of the revival of the archaic and long-discarded principle of conferring special franchise rights on property holders.  The first objection which the Minister felt would be raised to this Bill was that it brought in Rathmines and Pembroke.  So far as I am concerned, I am not making that objection. I support as strongly as I can the proposal to include in the Bill Rathmines and Pembroke.  My opposition is of an entirely different kind.  It is first in regard to the areas concerned.  It is because in addition to Rathmines and Pembroke, other areas which, in my opinion, should be included are not included that I ask the House to reject the measure.</P>
    <P>We have had from time to time, in regard to all cities, measures extending and enlarging the original boundaries and making provision to meet various stages of growth of the city.  In some cases, and it was the case in years gone by, extensions were made with great hesitation and only in a small way.  The Minister gave us an interesting outline of the efforts that had been made so far back as 50 or 60 years ago to extend the City of Dublin.  Many old traditions, many vested interests, stood in the way of doing things in a big way and on a large scale.  Of late years different ideas are held in regard to the necessity for planning extensions to the city on a large and extensive scale.  I am sorry to say that in this respect our Government here, which one would expect would not be tied down by these old traditions or hampered by them in any way, seem to be following in the tracks of their predecessors and, instead of looking at the problem in a big way as one would expect they should have done, they are nibbling at the problem. They are engaged in a process of nibbling just as one would expect to find a body doing 30, 40 or 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have had the question of Greater Dublin agitating the minds of the citizens and the people of the <Col N="956" /> country generally, as the Minister pointed out, for a period of something like 50 or 60 years.  All of us felt that the problem could only be satisfactorily and adequately dealt with by a home Government.  All of us had hoped that the home Government would not be tied by the traditions which affected previous Governments but I am afraid that all of us are sadly disappointed with this first effort on behalf of our native Government to deal with this age-long problem.  The Minister told us what happened 30 years ago, perhaps it is longer than 30 years ago. In the opening portion of his speech the Minister gave us a history of the attempt to include Rathmines, Rathgar and Pembroke in the city area. The citizens of Dublin 30 years ago were anxious to include Rathmines and Pembroke within the city. Every argument used then, and which has been recited by the Minister in the course of his speech, is an argument to-day in favour of the inclusion of the areas left out, by the Minister, in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I say we know what happened in the case of Rathmines and Pembroke. We had a Unionist Government in power in Westminster and we had Unionist Councils in power in Rathmines and Pembroke.  The combination of politics and vested interests was too strong for the Nationalist Corporation at the time, so Rathmines and Pembroke were left out.  We had had for over thirty years the anomaly of these two areas, which were really within the city, part of the city, but not part of the city for the purposes of local government.  When steps are being taken now to end that anomaly and to bring these two areas within the city, the Government in effect creates a greater anomaly by leaving out areas that are naturally part of the city, obviously ought to be part of the city, and are there because Dublin is there.  If the Minister proposed merely to leave them out and to wait until perhaps a greater realisation of the necessity for bringing them in should come to those in authority, until circumstances were such that they would be brought in <Col N="957" /> as a matter of course, it would be bad enough, but instead of that they are going further.  First, they are consolidating those outside areas, enlarging their powers, creating new vested interests and making, in so far as they can make, extremely difficult their future absorption by the growing city.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago, when the British Government refused to include Rathmines and Pembroke, if they had not alone left them as they were, but if they had proceeded to consolidate them and to create new vested interests, if they had given them new and additional powers to what they had already, and set up a Mayor and a Corporation there, if all that had been done, surely it would have been more difficult to-day to have these areas absorbed within the city?  Yet that is what the Minister proposed to do in this measure.  Blackrock, Dalkey and Dun Laoghaire are townships and are there because Dublin is here. They are part and parcel of Dublin just as much as Rathmines and Pembroke are part and parcel of Dublin. If there were no Dublin, would the Minister say, or would anybody say, or believe that we would have townships of the nature and kind that we have along our coast?  Would these townships not be just small coastal seaside towns like Laytown, Courtown, or Skerries, and places like that?  They are there because the city is there, and they are as much part and parcel of the city as Drumcondra and Clontarf are.  Drumcondra and Clontarf were taken into the city.  Already these townships have municipal services in common. The direction and the whole tendency will be for these services to grow.  The tendency is for the consolidation of these services.  Take, for instance, a service like the Fire Brigade.  You are proposing to have a duplication of these services.  One united body would be in a better position to provide the kind of machinery that would be necessary, say, for fire appliances than to have two separate bodies.  Many instances of that kind could be quoted.  These areas are really part and parcel of <Col N="958" /> the City of Dublin.  They had for many services in the old times, like the police, always been regarded as part of Dublin.  They are now to be divorced from Dublin and set up as an independent and, I might say, a rival authority to the City of Dublin. Every argument for the inclusion of Rathmines and Pembroke in the city of Dublin is an argument for the inclusion of the coastal borough in the city area.  We have heard about the men who have made their money in the city, and then went out to live in Rathmines, and then did not bear their proper share of the burden of the rates in the city out of which they made their living.  Now, they go, and they will go more in the future to live in Monkstown, Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Exactly the same thing is happening now.  These areas that I have mentioned have been brought nearer to the city as a result of motors and motor buses. I suppose that in the days before the motors came into use, it could be argued that Rathmines and Pembroke were quite a considerable distance from the city.  They were as far from the city then, speaking in terms of the time in which it would take to reach the city from their residence, as Howth, Stillorgan and Killiney are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked of the Greater Dublin Commission.  The Greater Dublin Commission went into this matter at very great length.  They examined expert witnesses, and they gave the matter very serious consideration. They considered that arrangements could be come to&mdash; as a matter of fact, they made representations to the effect that the area included in the townships should be included for local government affairs in one authority, with one great council to have control of the whole area, with local arrangements for local autonomy for the various areas within that.  Now, the Minister says that is not practicable, <Col N="959" /> but that is only a matter of opinion on the part of the Minister.  I think he will find that evidence was given by people who were expert in municipal affairs that it was a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put forward arguments as a result of consideration by himself and his Department showing why the report of the Commission could not be accepted in this regard.  In my opinion those arguments will not bear serious examination. We hear a lot in this country of the evils of partition and the waste and the extravagance of setting up two governments within a country that could very easily be governed by one authority. Here we find ourselves duplicating services and setting up two independent governments, creating vested interests which will be extremely difficult to deal with later on, if and when a demand is made for the absorption of the coastal borough in the City Council.  We have certain clumsy attempts in the measure to provide for co-operation between the borough and the city in matters of common interest.  The framers of the Bill, apparently, recognised the necessity for such co-operation, but I suggest that that could be had more simply and at very much less cost to the citizens as a whole if there were one authority governing the whole area.  I think no adequate case has been made by the Minister for rejecting the recommendations of the Greater Dublin Commission and for setting up an independent coastal borough, a new authority within the City of Dublin, for it is impossible to hold that these townships are not in effect part and parcel of the city, and are there because Dublin is there.</P>
    <P>In addition to the coastal borough areas there are other areas rapidly becoming part of the city.  The Minister talked of the slowness of the urbanisation of certain areas, but surely he must know the reason of that.  It is due to the difficulties placed in the way of local authorities by property owners.  We know <Col N="960" /> what is happening along the main outlets from the city.  Houses are erected on one side of the road, while no building whatsoever takes place on the other side of the road. That is due to the difficulties which are placed in the way of local authorities or private builders by the owners of property who will not allow them to build.  We have instances of that.  The Minister talked of town-planning.  Planning for the growth of a city is surely necessary The Minister also talks of a joint authority, but I suggest that we should look ahead and that the Greater Dublin Council would be a far more effective body than any joint authority such as the Minister suggests, for the purpose of planning the lines along which development should proceed.  What happens is, that we are late in making our plans; we find when we proceed to make our plans that something has already happened.  Haphazard buildings and development goes on without any real thought for coordination in a growing city.  That has repeatedly happened, and developments which we would like to see taking place on the outskirts of the city are hampered because of some haphazard attempt at development made without system, and often without very much thought as to what is going to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>There are various areas where building is taking place at present outside the city and the coastal borough.  For instance, the Mount Merrion Estate, which is at present being developed, will be neither in the city nor in the coastal borough. The result of all this will be that a new generation will be faced with the same class of problem as we ourselves are faced with to-day in regard to the development of the city.  A good deal has been said, though the Minister did not dwell much upon it, about the inadvisability of including agricultural land within the city area.  Surely an adjustment could be made.  It would not be beyond the power of the legislature to devise some suitable and equitable adjustment in <Col N="961" /> regard to agricultural land, so that it might be included within the city area.  It would be easier to do that than to allow the kind of thing that is going on.  It certainly would be well if land which is required for development would be within the control of the city authority.  I believe that sooner or later a demand, an irresistible demand, will be made by the citizens for the inclusion of all these areas which are now being left out by the Minister. I believe the same kind of demand will be made as has been made for years for the inclusion of Rathmines and Pembroke, and I believe the right thing to do is to make a really Greater Dublin now, a Dublin that the whole country and everyone who calls himself an Irishman can be proud of.</P>
    <P>The first and principal objection to this Bill is because of the area which it proposes to exclude.  I should say, having regard to the report of the Greater Dublin Commission, because it does not include areas that in my opinion ought to be included, and especially because not alone does it not include them, but it sets up a new borough with new and extended powers by way almost of rival to the city.</P>
    <P>On the second part of the question &mdash;the managership and the system of managerial control&mdash;it is a new system of development in local government.  It was tried in Cork by way of experiment, and I shall leave it to Deputy Anthony to tell us of the success of that particular experiment in Cork.  It will be sufficient for me to say that, so far as I can discover, the system has not proved the success that the Minister expected it would.  He asked me, in the course of his speech, whether I wanted a City Manager.  I am not against the idea of having a City Manager, if a City Manager is to be a chief Executive Officer, as the Minister seemed to indicate in his speech that he would be, but to my mind, listening to the Minister, there was a great deal of difference between his speech and what is in the Bill with regard to the powers and functions of the City Manager.  If <Col N="962" /> the City Manager is to be an Executive Officer, then I am in favour of the City Manager.  If he is to be, as he appears to me to be, given powers which he can exercise absolutely independent of the council, and if they are to be given to him to the extent that powers are given to him in the Bill, then I am against a City Manager, because in my opinion it is taking from the citizen and the council effective control of their affairs.  I have failed to find&mdash;perhaps the Minister would point it out to me&mdash;where the City Manager is subject to the council, or what measure of control they can exercise over him except in the striking of the rates.  It seems to me the only control the council can exercise over the Manager is to refuse to strike the rates.</P>

The distinction between what is policy and what is purely administrative matter does not appear to be very clearly defined. I think the question that came up in Cork was a question whether three-roomed, four-roomed, or five-roomed houses should be built.  Suppose it was that.  Who has the right to decide?</P>

Unless I am sure that they have I am not going to support that system, because I believe that the council as representatives of the people ought to have the supreme control.  That is what I am standing for.  If they have not they are merely a simulacrum of a council, and I would prefer to see the Government going out wholesale for a dictator.

To elect a council and pretend that they have certain powers and then to limit their powers to the extent that they are limited in this Bill, and to give the Manager the power that he is given in this Bill is not in my opinion in accordance with the principles of representative government, and because of that I am opposed to it. We will hear about Cork later and we will have the advantage of hearing how the matter works out there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be one of the reasons I would vote for it. Now I come to the third, and I think the most indefensible point of the whole lot, although the Minister did make an attempt to defend it.  It is a revival of an old discarded system, and I say <Col N="964" />&ldquo;revival&rdquo; advisedly.  Many of us will remember the system that existed pre-1898.  Some of us were not very much interested in local government at that time, but we remember the local landlord who had eight or nine votes.  Perhaps the President does not remember that time.  At every election for a board of guardians in 1895-96 the local landlord had as many as eight or nine votes, I think.  All that was done away with.  He had all those votes because he had a big valuation and because he owned property, but that was done away with.  Why was it done away with?  Was it a wrong principle?  But that principle is to be revived now by the President and his Ministers.  The same idea as running through the Minister's speech was advocated by those who opposed electoral reform in 1832 and for years afterwards.  What right had any man without property to have a vote?  What right had the ordinary labourer or workman to have a vote at all.  What did he know about it?  Do we or do we not want business men on our councils, asked the Minister.  We do, but we must bribe them to come in.  Is that the position?  Will these business men who serve their country so well refuse to carry out ordinary civic duties that all of us are supposed to carry out unless they get a special privilege and are placed in a privileged position?  That is the case the Minister makes.  If that is revived there is no knowing where it is going to stop.  I am sure the Minister could argue equally in favour of giving six votes to Deputy Good and one vote to Deputy Davin in a matter concerning income tax for instance. If we take the rate of income tax fixed on the people of this country Deputy Good, I am sure, pays six times the income tax that Deputy Davin pays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it?  But on that principle why begin at £50? Why should a man with £50 valuation <Col N="965" /> have only one vote when a man with £20 valuation has one vote? Why stop at even £250.  Why, if there are six votes for a man with £250, should not a man with £1,000 valuation have twelve votes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the principle is wrong.  What is behind the principle: one man, one vote? It is a question of human rights against property rights.  If the principle is good and sound in the City of Dublin, it should be good and sound in the coastal borough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that is the Minister's own view as expressed to a deputation of the Chamber of Commerce.  I have an extract here from a report of the Council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. We know, of course, what is the origin of this revived proposal. The report of the Chamber of Commerce contains an account of an interview with the Minister for Local Government on the 15th April, 1929. Deputy Good and Senator Nugent were members of the deputation from the Chamber of Commerce, and here is an extract from the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deputation based the claim for votes for companies on the ground that all business concerns as ratepayers should be given a voice in the election of the representatives who control the expenditure to which they contribute. In reply, the Minister stated that he would give careful consideration to the case put forward by the deputation.  But, in his opinion, if companies were to receive votes the privilege should not be restricted to the area to be dealt with by the Greater Dublin Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the opinion of the Minister, but evidently he believes in getting in the thin end of the wedge, and does not extend it to the whole <Col N="966" /> of the area dealt with in this Bill. Are there any business men in Dun Laoghaire, Monkstown and Blackrock? I think that principle cannot be defended; it is a vicious principle. It is a very poor compliment indeed that the Minister has paid to the business men here this evening, when he says that unless they are elected on a special franchise and given special privileges and rights they are not going to do what are the ordinary duties of every citizen&mdash;to take part in the civic management and control and government of their city.</P>
    <P>Why should business men have such special privileges?  Are there not other classes of the community who might claim special privileges? Professional men, solicitors, doctors, and professors must face the ordinary electorate and get the ordinary vote of the working man who lives down in a poor street.  They must hold their election meetings there if they want to become members of the council.  But the business man, the pillar of the State, must not be offended in any way; he need not in any way consult meetings.  He can get elected as the representatives on the Port and Docks Board get elected.  He can send round circulars to his business colleagues, and they need not even go to the trouble of going to the polling booths to mark their papers.  They can mark them in the privacy of their offices and send them in to be recorded for their special representatives.</P>
    <P>These are the three main objections that induced me to put down this amendment.  I do not wish at this stage to go into details with regard to every section, but I have given these three principal objections to the Bill.  I express regret that the Minister, when he was introducing new principles, did not introduce principles that many of us would be glad to see introduced in making a new departure with regard to local government.  We know that the whole principle in regard to local government here is that the local authority can only do the things that are laid down for it to do.  In other countries there is the opposite idea&mdash;<Col N="967" /> that except the things which are specially forbidden them to do, they can do anything in regard to local government or local control.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not make a better attempt at improving the machinery than he has shown in the Cork Act or in this Bill.  There are some other sections in the Bill that I would like to speak about, but at this stage I shall confine myself to what I said were the main objections to the Bill. In regard to the latter one especially, I believe the measure is entirely reactionary and is opposed to principles that have been won after long agitation.  I believe that if a principle of that kind were in force in 1916 we would not have had the advantage of the President in the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>We oppose this Bill almost wholly for the same reasons so far as reasons have been given as the Leader of the Labour Party. We object to the area that is proposed in the Bill.  We object because areas that we think ought to be included have not been included.  We are dissatisfied with the boundaries. We dislike intensely what Deputy O'Connell referred to as partition. Partition has entered so deeply into the souls of the Ministers and they are so fond of it that they are not satisfied with partition of the Thirty-two Counties; they want to extend it to the City of Dublin.  We object strenuously to the amputation of what we regard as an important area in what we think, at any rate, is the capital of Ireland.  The proposal to establish a coastal borough as a separate entity will be strenuously opposed by us.  We see no good reason for the adoption of that principle.  We object, as Deputy O'Connell objects, to the autocratic powers of the Manager.  We object to the powers being robbed from the City Council however it may be constituted.  We object to the commercial register.  We object to the insufficiency of representation.  We oppose the Second Reading for a variety of other reasons, particularly because of the powers that we think ought to be given to the Council under the Bill and which have not been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Deputy O'Connell referred to the failure to make provision of some kind for town planning.  Another matter, that has not so far been referred to and that we look upon as of great importance, is the failure to deal with the antiquated franchise of the Port and Docks Board and the failure to give power to the Corporation to deal with derelict sites.  These, amongst others, are important omissions.  We believe that when the subject is being dealt with at all important matters of that kind ought to have been brought within the scope of the Bill.  The Minister told us a little about the history of the Bill.  It was suggested to me that we should set out our main objections in the way of amendment as Deputy O'Connell did.  I felt after I read the Bill over and studied it a few times that that would be useless and that the better thing to do was to go straight for the whole Bill because the weight of advantages as against disadvantages was with the latter.  The Bill to my mind is a rotten one.  I think no better adjective could describe it.  It is a rotten Bill and worthy of the people&mdash;the reactionaries as they have grown in the last ten years&mdash; who introduced it (hear, hear).  I am glad you agree.</P>

      <P>The Greater Dublin Commission was appointed on July 4th, 1924.  This is February, 1930. The Final Report was dated February 29th, 1926, and the Bill was published on 11th February, 1930. For two years the Commission sat investigating the condition so far as local government is concerned of the City of Dublin and its environs. In that two years the Commission heard a great deal of evidence, and had before it people of all classes of society, experts in almost every branch of knowledge, at any rate, in so far as they could be connected with local government.  I took pains during the Recess to go through the evidence.  There are several large volumes of evidence in the Library.  I certainly got a considerable <Col N="970" /> amount of instruction from them.  It was valuable evidence, and those who wrote out their precis of evidence and afterwards appeared before the Commission to be examined and cross-examined went to a great deal of trouble and expense, and provided most valuable information for everybody who wished to avail of it.</P>
      <P>For that we ought to be grateful to those concerned.  We ought to be grateful to the members of the Commission.  It is remarkable that the Minister had not a word of thanks to offer to the members of the Commission who sat for two years examining into this question and bringing to bear on it long years of experience and expert knowledge. I certainly feel that a tribute of gratitude is due to the members of that Commission and to all the witnesses who came before it, and in one way or another, some to a great extent, and others to a less extent, added to the sum of our knowledge with regard to local government.  They deserve our thanks as citizens for duty done to this city.  That tribute of thanks would come naturally, better from the Minister than from me, but as he has omitted it, somebody ought to do it.  I would like to say this, that there was no one of these members of the Commission, as far as I know, of my way of thinking politically; most of them are the Minister's way of thinking, and that is all the thanks he shows them for their efforts.  The Chairman of the Commission, judging by the evidence and by the report, gave a lot of time, study and thought to that work.  He and his colleagues showed a civic spirit that seemed to be dead or at any rate moribund in this city for a long time, and the cause of which some of us may be able to describe. At any rate, for the civic spirit they displayed, both the members of the Commission and those who gave evidence before it, deserve our thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission that gave us this report set out over 90 recommendations of one kind or another dealing with every branch of local government, so far as it refers to that area. <Col N="971" /> I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government would call himself an expert on that subject or not, but the man who is probably his chief adviser, President Cosgrave, I am sure would call himself an expert.  As I said, they had this Commission sitting for two years. They selected their own people, they carefully selected some people with expert knowledge and long experience. These people made 95 recommendations.  What did the Government do with the recommendations? I think it would not be an exaggeration to say that they tore them in pieces and flung them in the faces of the Commission.  That is the gratitude they have shown to the Commission for their two years' work, their long report and their 95 recommendations. Of the 95 recommendations they have adopted four, so far as I can gather, in comparing the Bill and the recommendations of the Commission.  Some might increase the number, but my estimate is four recommendations of that report, arrived at after years of hard work and the best knowledge that was available from technicians, engineers, officials, and lawyers.  Every branch of knowledge that would affect local government was at the disposal of the Commission, and officials whom President Cosgrave holds in the highest regard gave expert advice. I have two particular officials in mind whom the President has gone out of his way to honour.  I do not think it would be proper to mention their names.  These two officials gave very valuable evidence, though I would not agree with it.  The President has honoured these men by promotion and otherwise; yet he tore up their evidence in the same way as he tore up the report of the Commission as a whole.  And he thinks they are fit and proper people to direct some of the most important affairs of the land, industrially and administratively, but he does not think their advice worth putting into practice when he gets it.</P>
    <P>We object to the boundaries set out in that report.  The Minister <Col N="972" /> told us a little of the history of the efforts of the Dublin Corporation to enlarge its boundaries in the last half century or so.  I am old enough to remember the Boundary Commission of 1900, though I was not in public life till three years or so later. I do not remember the one that goes back to 1878 or 1879.  That was some years before I was born.  I have taken an interest in these matters for a good many years.  President Cosgrave has too.  We both entered municipal politics about the same time.  We do know that the Dublin Corporation and Dublin citizens in general were anxious, for good reasons, we believe, to have the city boundaries extended, especially in the direction of Rathmines and Pembroke, and, as was brought out here this evening, it was the Unionist Government of the day in England, particularly the House of Lords, that defeated the efforts of the Municipal Council of Dublin.  It occurs to me in connection with the promotion of a Bill of that kind in the British House of Commons that it was in that connection Sinn Fein first became known as an organisation in municipal politics, because President Cosgrave, myself, and a few others started out to defeat the efforts of the Municipal Council in getting authority to go to London.  We succeeded eventually for good or ill, and now they have to come here.  I would rather they would have to go to a council that would be representative of all Ireland, but President Cosgrave had his way.  However, this is a digression.  It was one of the beginnings of Sinn Féin in municipal and international politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that Rathmines and Pembroke succeeded in their efforts in opposition to the Bill, and that they were not brought in. The arguments that were used in '78 and '79, and again in 1900, with regard to the bringing of Rathmines and Pembroke within the ambit of the city proper, are as sound to-day as they were 30 or 40 years ago. There is no change except that time has made these arguments all the more valuable, and has brought out to a greater extent the truth of the <Col N="973" /> arguments that were used 30 or 50 years ago.  I would like to say further, that similar arguments for the spread of urbanisation around the old City of Dublin that were used 50 or 30 years ago in favour of the bringing in of Rathmines and Pembroke into the city, can be advanced with regard to the areas that the Minister now proposes to include in the southern coastal borough, and many areas in the northern borough, contiguous to the city.  All means of transport in the last 30 years have developed at a remarkably rapid rate, and they are, if not solely, to a great extent responsible for the tremendous changes in municipal life and in the ordinary life of our people.  We have to take note of these facts and realise the great change that has taken place in the manner of living of our people, and in the transport arrangements.  It is quite proper to use the arguments that were used with regard to Rathmines and Pembroke 30 years ago as to why they should be included in the city, in reference to Dalkey and Dun Laoghaire to-day. The same arguments apply.  We look upon the setting up of the coastal borough as an independent body as just as great a blunder, municipally speaking, as the keeping of Rathmines and Pembroke with their boundaries outside the old City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>One argument used with regard to Rathmines and Pembroke was that there was no natural boundary there.  The same thing applies with regard to the coastal borough to-day. Anyone starting from here, by road or train, and going to Dalkey will see one city without a boundary of any kind.  There is nothing to mark a boundary between the old city and Dun Laoghaire, between it or Blackrock or Dalkey.  It is all one continuous city, and we believe it should be part and parcel of the city which is the capital of Ireland.  We think, and I personally agree with Deputy O'Connell, that this matter has been viewed with eyes that have no vision. They have not the courage to envisage the growth of Dublin or the <Col N="974" /> growth even of their own amputated part of Ireland.  They ought to drop the old notion of those who, in the British Parliament, could not see fit to include Rathmines with Pembroke, and look on this problem with the eyes of a progressive citizen, of one who has faith and believes in the future of the capital city of our country.  To my mind, the arrangement that is proposed is democratically and nationally grotesque.  For what purpose the boundaries suggested have been adopted, I do not know.  To my mind they bear a very close resemblance to the gerrymandering of President Cosgrave's Orange friends in the North last year.</P>
    <P>In reference to the coastal borough, what I think can be called the Solomon's judgment that they propose to put into operation displays a cynical indifference and culpable ignorance of municipal affairs.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell when he says that it is reactionary.  It is certainly that, and to my mind is opposed to the teaching of civic experience so far as I know.  What I have said with regard to the proposed southern boundary of the city applies, in great measure, to the northern boundaries also.  The old boundaries of 30 years ago are to be preserved with slight modifications so far as the northern boundary is concerned. Why such a place as Artane or Raheny should not be in the City of Dublin is more than I can explain.</P>
    <P>The second reason that we object to giving a Second Reading to this Bill is because of the autocratic powers that it proposes to give to the managers in the enlarged city and in the southern coastal borough. The Bill, instead of setting out the powers that the manager would have, which to my mind would be the natural way of doing it, sets out the very restricted powers that the council will have, all the rest going to the manager.  One of a number of powers which the Corporation and the borough council will have will be that of being able to confer the freedom of the city.  That, I think, is a fair sample of the type of <Col N="975" /> powers that are to be given to the elected council.  Of course, they will have power over the striking of the rates, but they are not to have a word to say as to the spending of that money when it is raised.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>They can raise the money, but not spend it.  They can raise the money and hand it over to the manager, who will then advise them, but they cannot even advise the manager. There are several sections in the Bill setting out how the manager is to advise the council, but there is no arrangement for the council to advise the manager.  They can amend by-laws on the instruction of the manager; they can make an order, when instructed by the manager, putting his decisions into operation. But any effective power that they are to have can only be exercised when the manager directs them so to do.  The manager is to advise the elected body, but the elected body is not to advise him. Autocrats do not accept advice. Therefore there is no arrangement for the council to advise the manager.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that one of the powers that would be given to men in a responsible body, men elected by an important municipality like Dublin to run its affairs, would be the right to select their own manager. I do not know whether we have any trusts or big combines in this city.  I know that we have factories that are branches of combines, but I do not know that we have anything bigger in that way than the railways.  Would anybody suggest to me that the directors of the railway system in Ireland should not have the right to elect their own general manager?  In this Bill the body into whose hands the citizens are to entrust the running and working of their city are told in advance that they are so bereft of honesty, intelligence and integrity that they are not to be allowed to elect the chief official of their organisation, but that some <Col N="976" /> hand-picked body behind closed doors is to select the manager.  We can easily guess the type of man that will be selected and the qualifications that will be looked for.  The hand-picked body behind closed doors will select the manager.</P>
    <P>I wonder where they are going to get this super-man?  He will probably be somebody who has served well in the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal.  That would be the chief qualification, as it was the chief qualification of Deputy Doctor O'Higgins when made county medical officer of health down in the County Meath a couple of months ago&mdash;no special qualification, although we were told that particular office required super-excellent qualifications.  When it came to putting that in practice we have one example of how it was done.  We will have another when it comes to the appointment of Manager for Greater Dublin.  Fear of the people is evidenced in almost every line of this Bill, at least in any line that the people might have any say in.  That is from people who are always mouthing about the will of the people, how they want the will of the people in evidence everywhere. But they never get an opportunity of this kind that they do not take good care that the people will have as little power as they can give them.</P>
    <P>When the manager is to be appointed the body who will appoint him will not be his colleagues in the municipal council.  They will have nothing to say to it.  They will shut their eyes and open their mouths and see what Cumann na nGaedheal will send them.  I was interested in looking over the evidence to find that one gentleman&mdash;I think within the last couple of years he was chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin&mdash;was asked by one of the members of the Commission what his view was as to giving the right of selecting their own manager to that elected body, and the gentleman, Mr. J.C.M. Eason, answered, speaking for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce: &ldquo;I cannot see how you could remove from the administrative <Col N="977" /> body which will have control over the executive the power of choice in managers.&rdquo;  Again he said: &ldquo;I favour giving absolute freedom of selection.&rdquo;  Even the Chamber of Commerce is more progressive and has a little more trust in the citizens of Dublin than this reactionary body known as the Free State Executive Council.  Then if it comes to removing this superman, this manager, unless the Council pass a resolution by a two-thirds majority they cannot call for his removal, and even if they be unanimous they must submit to the will of the Minister.  He is the person who will say whether that manager shall be dismissed or not.  Constitutional history tells us that even the King of England can be removed off his throne by a majority in the British House of Commons, but the future king of Dublin cannot be removed, even if the elected representatives are unanimous.</P>
    <P>Another objection we have in common with Deputy O'Connell to this Bill is the commercial franchise, so called.  Again, here we have evidence of the fear of the common people by those who have for seven or eight years, as I have already said, been mouthing from one hundred platforms all over the country how they love and trust the people, and only want the will of the people to be put into execution.  Here we have another evidence of their profound trust in the will of the common people, the common people that brought all of us who have any right to be in an elected assembly, this or any other, into our positions as Deputies or Councillors.  The common people, who first elected President Cosgrave, are not good enough to elect the council.  You see, we have got up in the aristocracy of councils.  We have moved up the ladder on the necks of the common people, President Cosgrave included, and when we get up we know how to treat the common people.  This is a vicious effort to restore the old ascendancy on the necks of the Dublin citizens.  It is a return to the autocracy that was fought for centuries <Col N="978" /> in this and many other countries, and which was smashed more than a century ago.  The Northern Government, so called, the Government of the Six Counties, I read somewhere recently, boasts of going step by step in legislation with the Parliament of England.  I suppose this is the first movement in the step by step policy of President Cosgrave following on the footsteps of his friend, Lord Craigavon.  They introduced something of this kind into their local government legislation a year or two ago.</P>
    <P>The principle of giving a man votes according to the size of his bank account is bad, and is one that no democratic institution ought to stand over.  This playing for the Unionist and Tory vote, that is what I call it, by President Cosgrave is due to a feeling that the common people are slipping away from him, and he is trying to tie as fast as he can the element he fought so long, and which he is now clasping to his bosom and hoping that they will clasp bim to theirs, in the expectation that he will be kept in power a little longer.  In this section of the Bill the common people are insulted, and an effort is made to see that their representatives on the council will be impotent.  In this connection I saw a few lines in the Labour paper, I do not know whether it is the official organ of the Labour Party or not, &ldquo;The Irishman.&rdquo;  Referring to this particular section it was stated in that paper: &ldquo;Words fail us to comment on this reactionary measure. One can only wonder how much it will be worth in subscriptions from property owners to the election funds of Cumann na nGaedheal.&rdquo; Probably they had one eye on the poor electorate keeping them out, and another eye on the big bank balance of the commercial elements in the city when they were including this section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we object to the Bill is because the proposal for a council of twenty-one members, outside the few aristocrats, is an inadequate representation.  When we include in Dublin County Boroughs Rathmines, Pembroke, and Rathgar <Col N="979" /> that means roughly a representation of one to every 19,000 of the population, and that to my mind is not an adequate representation in a popularly elected or democratic body.  I realise there are difficulties in a matter of that kind.  There was a difficulty because of the slow and inefficient working in the old days of the Dublin Corporation when we had 80 members for a much smaller area.  These eighty members represented a population of 300,000.  I do not want over-representation.  I do not want such a crowded assembly as would make impossible proper working, but I do say, and my colleagues here agree with me, that twenty-one representatives for a population of 418,000, or almost 420,000, is insufficient and would not give the opportunity for getting adequate representation for all classes of the community.  The Greater Dublin Commission in their report suggested that 54 members would be necessary to give adequate representation on the basis of population. That is on the 1911 Census.  They said that the old City of Dublin should have 47 members, and the townships now proposed to be added. should have 10.</P>

      <P>The omnipotent and omniscient President on municipal affairs is wrong for once.  I am not a faddist on such questions as town-planning. I realise the difficulty in that matter, and I realise especially that money is a great difficulty in clearing away obstacles.  If you want to plan a city properly, especially an old city like Dublin, you require to have ample money at your disposal.  Here you have an old city with a modern exterior, with new areas and with others which, we hope will form, as John Redmond used to say, at no far distant date, a splendid capital of a great country called Ireland, and not merely of 26 Counties.  Having that in view and looking a bit forward, I think that some arrangement ought to be made &mdash;call it town-planning or what you will&mdash;by which power ought to be given in the Bill to the principal municipal authority to plan and lay out such schemes for the future. Such plans, however, are not, so far as I can see, within the ambit of this <Col N="981" /> Bill.  Numerous people who take a keen interest in this matter, some of them distinguished citizens, gave evidence before the Commission as to the necessity of town-planning, and the Commission was seized with its importance, and included it among the recommendations in their report. It is nearly the hundredth recommendation which the President tore up and threw back at the Commission which he himself appointed.</P>
      <P>I would like to see some powers given for regulating the future development of the city.  I know that in our own time, in the last 25 years or so, the Municipal Council experienced great difficulty in widening streets and making new thoroughfares, and that great expense had to be incurred in connection with such work.  To my own knowledge there were cases in which part of a street was widened so far back as 25 years ago, and in which houses in streets like George's Street and Aungier Street in the South, and Liffey Street in the North, were knocked down and others pushed back ten or twenty feet to improve the thoroughfares.  Yet, owing to the absence of power to deal with the problem, that condition remains to-day.  The Corporation has to wait until the lease falls in, and even then it often happens that because of enormous expense the widening of such thoroughfares cannot be continued. It is to avoid difficulties of that kind that I suggest that if you had people who were looking ahead in regard to such matters, they would have put some provision in the Bill giving power to the municipal authorities by which they could in a large way&mdash;I am not speaking or bye-streets and alleys&mdash;direct the channels in which the main traffic would go to and from the city, say, for 30 or 40 years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a case brought to my notice only within the last fortnight in connection with one of the new thoroughfares in North Dublin, Griffith Avenue, a case in which that magnificent thoroughfare has been blocked by a landlord who erected four houses on a plot of land facing it.  He apparently had the plot, the <Col N="982" /> money and the power and he built four houses which practically blocked that magnificent thoroughfare. In order to prevent that sort of thing the Minister should have included provisions giving some extra powers to the municipal authorities in the Bill.  Another matter that ought to have been dealt with in considering Dublin and in arranging for the restoration to the citizens of their municipal powers was the position of the Port and Docks Board in relation to the city. I am of opinion, and I think that a great many citizens agree with me, that the existence of the Port and Docks Board with its present powers and franchise is an anomaly.  I do not object to those who have a very special interest in the port&mdash;such as shippers and commercial men who have special interests to guard&mdash; getting special representation, but I do object to them practically owning and controlling the port, which is the main artery, so far as the commercial life of the city is concerned, and, indeed, so far as the life-blood of the Twenty-six Counties is concerned.  I do not think that a port of the importance of that of the capital city should be in such hands but should be run in the interests not alone of the city but of the country, and I think that the type of management and control that now exists in the Port and Docks Board is something which should have received consideration from the Minister.  I wonder if we might again drag Cumann na nGaedheal into this matter, because the Chairman of the Port and Docks Board is also Chairman of Cumann na nGaedheal and that may be the reason that their powers are not being touched.  Such things have happened.</P>

There are others which we can go into later, as no <Col N="983" /> doubt there will be plenty of talk when it comes to the Committee Stage and we are not going to waste it all to-night.  There will be plenty of opportunity for Ministers to defend their Cumann na nGaedheal Bill.</P>

      <P>I come to another aspect of the matter with which it is pertinent to deal in discussing Dublin and the restoration of the powers which the President stole from the citizens in 1924.  I come to the Commissioners. I know Ministers are anxious to take part in the debate.  I know the Minister for Education is bursting with anxiety to speak.  I will give him a chance in a few minutes.  He has a whole deck of cards in front of him, dealing them out since the debate started.  He will have plenty of time but he will not put all his cards on the table, you may be quite certain. I would like to know as one citizen, a very modest citizen, what the Commissioners have done during their term of office for Dublin?</P>

There will have to be an examination to see how accounts and moneys were dealt with, and of matters that have a very close connection with the finances of the city at the moment.  One item that occurs to me is the debt of the city.  That will hamper future development. Owing to the fact that the debt of Dublin has been increased by two millions practically in the last six years, the future development of the city will be hampered.  Every aspect of the city life will be hampered in some way by reason of the fact that this debt has been incurred.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that with that ruling I will have to curtail my speech considerably.  We will have some chance of getting at it.  I will not discuss the details with regard to their working, but I do contend that if this Bill be passed, taking into consideration the powers that are to be given to the manager, the autocrat who is to be called manager, the system will not be very different from the system that has been in operation in Dublin in the last six years. That has not been for the good of the city.  I would like to warn the House against giving autocratic powers of that kind to any individual when I see what has happened when autocrats have been put in control.  In this Bill it is proposed that a certain measure of control and at any rate publicity can be given, and I hope will be given, to the acts not alone of the council but of the manager as well. If that is not given we will have a repetition of the last six years, which has not made for a better Dublin.  I do not want to discuss or attempt to discuss the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.  But I do maintain that the Dublin that will be restored to the new council, with its truncated powers, will be, financially speaking, hampered at every turn.  Therefore it is all the more necessary that the council should have free choice in all matters, especially with regard to expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debt of Dublin is now practically two million pounds more than <Col N="988" /> it was six years ago, and in extending its boundaries and its services that fact must be taken into consideration. While the debt has gone up by two million pounds, and while the Government have showered money on the gentlemen who are in control, the gentlemen appointed by the Minister for Local Government or by his predecessor or, more strictly speaking, by President Cosgrave himself, these gentlemen have so used the autocratic power they have, as to make us feel the consequences if an autocrat of that kind will be in control of the city in the future.  They have so used that power that the city is considerably in debt now as compared with six years ago, and yet in many things, and particularly in one aspect of municipal life, especially as far as Dublin is concerned, it is far and away worse off than it was when the control was taken from the Municipal Council by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be regarded as rude or offensive to these gentlemen personally, but I might call them marionettes appointed by President Cosgrave who run the City of Dublin. They are marionettes in so far as their every action was directed with an eye on the local government headquarters. That was bound to be so because they were temporary officials. I say with regard to one aspect of municipal life we are very much worse off altogether, even though we are in debt considerably more, and I emphasise this, because unless the powers of that manager are curtailed and greater power given to those who will have as a primary interest the interest of the poor and the working classes&mdash;unless power to look after the poor to a greater extent is given to the new council&mdash;we will have a worse condition even than the Medical Officer of Health described in his speech the other day in Dublin. He was speaking on the question of housing.  The Medical Officer of Health, speaking last week at a meeting connected with the Orthopædic Hospital in Merrion Street, said: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the houses that have been built in and around <Col N="989" /> Dublin, it would be news to some of them that there were more unsanitary rooms and dwellings to-day than ever in the history of Dublin.&rdquo;  That is the statement made by the responsible Officer for Health in Dublin, that there are more unsanitary rooms and dwellings to-day than there were ever in the history of Dublin. &ldquo;There were kitchens occupied to-day that had been closed in Sir Charles Cameron's time.&rdquo;  Sir Charles Cameron is probably ten or twelve years dead.</P>
    <P>I think it is pertinent to this Bill to say that the system of autocracy has not done for Dublin all that ought to have been done for it, especially in the erection of houses in the last six years, and if that principle is to be extended, as proposed in this Bill, ten years hence we will have the same complaint to make in this House.  Money, I will not say has been lavishly given, but a considerable amount of money in grants for houses was given in the last six years&mdash;half-a-million pounds, and another half million pounds in various other ways was given to Dublin.  Despite that, compared with the old days of the Dublin Corporation, the way money was showered in the last six years and the use that has been made of it, at least the improvements that we can see in the city, is something that would not recommend the autocratic system to me.</P>
    <P>Further than that I do not want to go into the history and administration of the Commissioners now. But as it is proposed in this Bill to restore even the truncated powers of the municipal council&mdash;to restore the municipal control to Dublin, I think I might say this much, especially in view of the fact that the evidence given at the Greater Dublin Commission very frequently showed that the citizens and some citizens of responsibility had an idea that in the past those in charge of the Municipal Council were a corrupt body.  It occurred, I will not say at every sitting, but certainly it occurred very frequently in the sittings of the Greater Dublin Commission. <Col N="990" /> There was some one or other citizen who, in the course of his cross-examination, did cast a reflection upon the old municipal council and talked of it as a corrupt, inefficient and improper body.  It may have been inefficient in many ways, but I had fifteen years experience of it and I deny in toto the charge of corruption.</P>
    <P>I would remind this House that there was a Commission set up in 1924 by President Cosgrave to examine into the question of administration and to hear charges that might be brought by any citizen against the Municipal Council.  Not one solitary citizen came forward with a charge of corruption against that body.  I think it is only fair that I should say that.  There has been no opportunity to stand up to these charges, certainly to those that had been made at the sittings of the Greater Dublin Commission.  I feel that it is only right, as one who for many years was a member of that body to say that I, at any rate, did not find that that body was a corrupt body.  I know in the City of Dublin great and important bodies where nepotism is rampant.  All of us know it.  I certainly could not make that charge in the same wholesale way against the old Municipal Council of Dublin.  These statements when they were made at the Greater Dublin Commission were frequently repeated and printed in the daily and weekly Press.  It is unfair to ourselves as citizens, to the Municipal Council, and to our city that these unproved charges should be allowed to remain and to be continued. I do not wish to be taken as a defender of all the acts of that old body during the time that I had cognisance of it.  I am not going into it very deeply now, but I want to say that I went into that Corporation with President Cosgrave.  When we went in there first we were a small minority.  We were a reform party in that body.  We were attacking that body and criticising it with all the powers that we possessed.  While we did criticise it.  I doubt if President Cosgrave will disagree with me when I say <Col N="991" /> that he could not lay his hands on even one instance of what could be accurately described as corruption in that body during the time that he was a member of it, and our periods of service there were co-equal.</P>
    <P>The system there was not ideal, I admit.  There were many changes and many amendments that could be made; but offering suggestions for amendment is one thing and allowing a body of that kind, its antiquity and its standing, to be crushed and blotted out of existence, and allowing charges of corruption to be made against it, is something that I, at any rate, was not prepared for from President Cosgrave.  Within the last six years these charges have been constantly made and, with all respect, I say to the President that it was his duty as much as mine to have stood up to those who were making these charges&mdash;that is, if he believes as I believe that that body was not a corrupt body.  It did not, perhaps, do its work as efficiently as it might; that could be argued; but inefficiency is one thing, even if that were proved, and corruption is quite another thing.  I would never stand up here to defend inefficiency, but, having in mind my own membership for so many years, I certainly would not be fair or true to myself and to my own good name if I allowed that slur to remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>The fact that President Cosgrave suppressed the municipal council by his own order was responsible at that time for reviving these charges of corruption and probably was responsible for all the references that were made before the Greater Dublin Commission to the corrupt and inefficient body and all the sins for which it was supposed to be responsible. I think the least he might do &mdash;and he has the opportunity now&mdash; is to defend his own honour as a member of that body.  If it was corrupt he is as much responsible as any other individual member of it, and, in fact, he is more responsible because in later years he was the leader of the Dublin Corporation. <Col N="992" /> He occupied that position in 1920. I was not there then.  He was the leader and if it was a corrupt body he was the chief person who was corrupt in it.  If I were there I know where he would be; he would be the small boy that he always was.  That is where he would be.  I was not there at the time.  Later when he gets into power he suppresses the body of which he was a member for so long and allows charges to be made against it that were never proved.  There was no attempt ever made to prove the charges of corruption made against that body. That is no credit to him, even if he is the President of the partitioned twenty-six counties of Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been attacked from various sides, first because it introduces into the proposed new city too much territory, and then because it introduces too little territory.  The mover of the amendment, Deputy O'Connell, dealt with what are the main principles of the Bill, and his speech in that sense was eminently a Second Reading speech.  He dealt particularly with three points which are after all, the cardinal features of the Bill&mdash;the appointment and the duties of a City Manager, the extension of the city and the precise location of its boundaries, and thirdly, the adoption to a certain limited extent <Col N="993" /> of a franchise that is not the ordinary franchise that at present prevails. There may be obscurities in the Bill.  We were not aware there were these obscurities, but it is quite possible from a great deal of discussion that has taken place outside the House, and it is quite clear too from Deputy O'Connell's speech and the interchange of opinion that took place between himself and the Minister for Local Government, that it might be said there is an obscurity as to what the precise relations of the Manager and the City Council are.  We are of the opinion that the matter is set forth clearly in the Bill, and it is not true to say that the City Manager is the master of the Council and that the Council is deprived of all practical power.  I can well imagine that those who examine the Bill in a hostile manner, even some who might be quite friendly to the Bill but do not see it quite from the point of view of those who were responsible for the Bill, may say that the powers reserved to the Council are not sufficient.  There may be some obscurity on that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the question of housing.  He thought it was advisable and healthy for the future government of the city that there should be a pretty clear definition of functions.  I think duality of functions is the phrase referred to in the Commission's report.  In determining in favour of that duality of functions it was certainly intended, and that is the purpose of the Bill, that matters of general policy should be with the Council and administration with the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the question of houses, and asked would the council have any voice in determining whether they would be three-roomed or four-roomed houses.  So far as that is concerned, I think it would be a matter for the Council to determine that in a certain area so many houses are wanted of a certain specific type.  After all, they have control of the purse.  In drawing up their estimates, they have also control so far as borrowing is concerned. It is for them to put up to the manager <Col N="994" /> and to discuss with the manager the type of house and vote the money for that particular type of house.</P>

      <P>Section 49. If there is any obscurity in the matter, as there does seem to be, there is no reason why reasonable amendments which will define the relative powers of the manager and the council should not be put forward. I think the Minister in his speech made it quite clear that there was that duality of function.  I think Deputy O'Connell acknowledged in his speech that it was clear there was that duality of function and that that was the purpose of the Bill.  This undoubtedly is intended, as was the Cork Bill before it, as a very important reform in local government in this country.  So far as the City of Dublin is concerned, it was the next step to the governing of the city by means of Commissioners purely as a temporary measure.  In itself, we thought that the attempt to govern the city by Commissioners, though we regarded it as only a temporary measure, was a step forward.  I think it was generally regarded, and is generally regarded, as such by the bulk of the people of Dublin.  The experience of those interested in democratic forms of government, especially local government, in this country and practically every other country, is that during a long period it had to face a certain number of difficulties. Experience has brought them face to face with these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain dissatisfaction undoubtedly exists with the ordinary type of city government that we have been mainly familiar with in this country. It is a system that we have inherited from a neighbouring country.  There has been a growing sense of dissatisfaction with that particular type of government.  It is not what Deputy O'Kelly spent a long portion of his curtailed speech in dealing with; it is not a question of corruption; that is not the question.  It is not a question as to whether the people <Col N="995" /> elected are morally fit to be there&mdash; whether they are corrupt or not. That is not what causes the dissatisfaction. Essentially that is not what gives rise to the problem.  What gives rise to the problem is the growing complexity of the various kinds of business that local government has to deal with.  That complexity is increasing every day.  There are continual demands being made on all types of government &mdash; central government and local government&mdash; by way of new services on behalf of their respective communities.  That is increasing, and must increase.  A system of government that grew up so far as this country is concerned under entirely different circumstances, which had nothing democratic in its origin whatsoever, which was never meant to deal with the problems that local government has now to deal with, is still being asked in many cases to deal with problems altogether far beyond the problems dealt with formerly. Local government, as I say, has become more and more complex.  It is impossible, especially in the case of the larger cities, for a system of government that was tolerable enough 80 years ago, and was able to carry on not merely the general policy, but also the administration, to be satisfactory to-day.  You might as well expect this Dáil to carry on the administration of the country as well as deciding on the question of the general policy.  That is a thing it does not attempt to do. Those who have experience in this House ought to know well that such a thing would be absolutely impossible. What holds true for the Dáil in reference to the country holds equally true, though to a lesser extent, in the case of the city.  But you have complexity in both cases. It is fair to say that, comparing the extent of the districts and the number of people to be dealt with, it would be quite as impossible for a city council in modern times to carry on the administration of the city as well as decide its policy in anything like an efficient manner.  It is not a question of corruption one way or <Col N="996" /> another.  A number of individual citizens have put themselves forward again and again for election.  They have taken on their shoulders the business of the government of different areas&mdash;different organised centres and cities.  They have undertaken that burden, but it is becoming increasingly impossible for them to do it if they are not to be relieved of the purely administrative side of the duties of local government, and that is really what is at the basis of the desire to distinguish the functions of the manager from the functions of the council.</P>
    <P>The whole case made against the Bill from that point of view is based on the assumption that the normal relation between the City Manager and the Council will be one of distrust and a desire to hamper each other in forwarding the general interests of the citizens, whose welfare it is their business to promote I refuse to take that particular view of the relations that would prevail between the Council and the City Manager.  When representatives are chosen at an election they are, at the very best, chosen because they represent a certain general policy.  That very often happens.  They may be chosen also on account of certain general abilities they have, but nobody could suggest that a person is generally chosen because he has a particular administrative ability.  He is not chosen from that point of view.  He may represent a certain point of view as to the duties of a municipal council, what it should undertake or should not undertake; whether it should undertake more services and therefore increase the rates, or whether it should lop off some services already there and therefore cut down the rates Questions of general policy of that kind generally govern elections to municipal bodies.  The members are not elected on account of their administrative ability.  As a result of the increasing business devolving upon them, that question of the administration is becoming of greater and greater importance, with the result that it becomes a matter of life <Col N="997" /> and death to a city, especially a big city like Dublin, to get expert advice, to get specialist advice, and the best type of manager you can get to look after the purely administrative side of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts quite a number of things, and having read some of the criticism to which it was subjected outside the House and listened to the criticism offered to the Bill by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Kelly, it seems to me, if I express my own personal point of view, that the Bill was attacked on account of its merits and not on account of any demerits it may have.  It was attacked because of the good points it has, so far as this is a Bill to promote the future government of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It has been thrown in our faces that this Bill is undemocratic.  Any attempt to interfere with the old system that we have inherited from what we may call the Victorian days is always denounced as undemocratic. I know there is one party opposite especially that cannot get away from the prejudice of confusing democratic institutions and British institutions. From the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the twentieth century, when local government in England had to a certain extent become democratic, because to an extent it had always some kind of representative character, there was the view that attempts to interfere with it must cut away the root principles of democracy.  We have had that particular prejudice to face in this House again and again.  I cannot see that there was anything essentially democratic in the particular type of local government that came down to us from a very aristocratic period, that was particularly suited and developed in one country, but which had very little to do with the general principles of democracy, and for a long period of its existence was completely in disagreement with it.  The question is, what has anybody interested in democratic government, whether workman or capitalist, to gain from wasteful administration?  If you <Col N="998" /> have wasteful administration, that is not necessarily due to any corrupt qualities on the part of the people elected, but to the fact that you are putting upon people whose business is not primarily local administration, work they cannot possibly undertake. We hold that it is in the interest of democratic institutions that you should have good administration. Everybody will realise that new burdens are being put upon the taxpayers and the ratepayers.  New services are undertaken by central governments and local governments. That being so, surely if the burdens are not to become intolerable it is our duty to see that the money raised is properly administered.  It is of prime interest for the future continuance of anything like democratic government to see that the thing is properly administered.  That is the reason why we take our stand on this question, and what Deputy O'Connell harps back upon and called the managerial system.  It is a practical matter; it is a question of life and death for local institutions in this country, because if there is not proper management the burdens will become so heavy that you will have to revert to what Deputy O'Kelly would call autocracy.</P>
    <P>Other points with which I shall deal were raised by Deputy O'Connell. He took three points which he said were the crucial points of the Bill.  One was the question of the extent of the city.  Deputy O'Kelly, on the whole, so far as a Second Reading speech went, followed Deputy O'Connell very closely.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that in dealing with the coastal townships we were tied down by old tradition.  Surely we are not.  So far as traditions are effective at all, and so far as Deputy O'Connell brought them out, they referred to two other townships.  We are not tied down by old traditions.  To say that merely because a thing has existed for a number of years, and merely because these townships have enjoyed to a considerable extent from time immemorial, or certainly for a long time, certain privileges, that in itself because it is an old tradition is not <Col N="999" /> sufficient now to do away with their separate autonomy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question which you ought to take in or which you leave out.  It is not a question of principle.  Rathmines and Pembroke are geographically much more close to Dublin in interest and more closely bound up with Dublin than the other townships mentioned.  Deputy O'Connell mentioned various other places like Foxrock because the people who live there have their business in Dublin. He asked why treat them like Skerries.  Skerries also has to a large extent its existence in Dublin.  Deputy Davin made a very illuminating remark about Greystones. Precisely, his argument so far as it was valid, would lead to the inclusion of Greystones in the Bill.  It is not true to say that we have given them increased power.  We have not. We have joined them together and consolidated them.  Deputy O'Connell also used the phrase that we had consolidated them.  We have.  By this Bill we have attempted to consolidate them but we have not given them increased powers, and I see no reason why there should be any more difficulty if the time comes, and I think Deputies O'Connell and O'Kelly saw it coming very soon, when the demand would be irresistible. If a demand became irresistible it could not be resisted and, therefore, the millennium will come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We suggest that the case has been definitely made out.  As Deputy O'Connell himself pointed out, the case is long ago made out, so far as Rathmines <Col N="1000" /> and Pembroke are concerned.  The contention of the Minister for Local Government is that no case has been made out for inclusion, so far as the coastal townships are concerned. To justify inclusion and their addition to the City of Dublin some attempt should be made to show that there was community of interest requiring their absorption in the city. No such attempt has been made The Minister gave several reasons why it would be unwise to incorporate these townships in the city.  But it was assumed that because they had the same tramway system as Dublin, because they had the same police service as Dublin, therefore they should be included in the city. That argument was applied.  It is a matter for the common-sense of the Dáil to decide whether this Bill is just in including Rathmines and Pembroke and not including the coastal boroughs.  Then what services are there in common which would require to be dealt with by a common authority over them, common to the coastal borough and to the new greater City of Dublin?</P>
      <P>The other point that has been raised is a question of the franchise. Before I pass from the question of the coastal borough, those who have listened to the debate will have noticed that both Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Kelly took up the line, and anybody not knowing the actual state of things as they are at present, would certainly be under the impression that these were integral portions already of the civil administration of Dublin that we were lopping off the City of Dublin administration.  It may be said that that was a mere matter of words.  It was not, but a clever shifting of the onus of proof.  They took it for granted that they were in the City of Dublin, and that the onus of proof lay on those who were outside, whereas the normal thing is to take for granted the existing state of affairs, and the onus of proof lies on those who want to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter I will deal with is the question of the business franchise. At a public meeting held in the City of Dublin the Bill was objected <Col N="1001" /> to on the very extraordinary grounds that this was an effort to give over 16 per cent. of the representation of the City of Dublin in the new City Council to foreign capitalists, though if one-fourth of what we have heard about the new City Council is true, the wonder is that Deputy O'Kelly or Deputy O'Connell should care in the least as to who gets in or as to who gets out. This was the statement made by a Mr. Daly&mdash;I do not know whether I should call him a colleague of Deputy O'Connell or not&mdash;namely, that 16 per cent. of the representation of the new City of Dublin was to be given over to foreign capitalism. Some people, I suggest, have foreign capitalism on the brain.  I think the phrase used by Deputy O'Kelly was that a man was to get votes because he had a big bank balance.  That is precisely what the principle involved in the Bill tries to avoid.  It was not because people have property of a certain amount that they were given an extra vote, this special representation.  It was because they represented business interests and, presumably, gave employment.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of discussion in this House about the lack of employment in the City of Dublin, the lack of energy of business men, and the first effort this Government makes in a Bill of this kind to do something to give that particular type of interest representation is immediately denounced as a betrayal of all democratic principles, as a setting back of the clock, as a going back to 1832.  Listening to Deputy O'Kelly more than Deputy O'Connell, I was under the impression that we were disfranchising a lot of people and that the only people who had votes were people with certain property qualifications. We are not disfranchising anyone. The ordinary person will exercise his vote, but the question is: is it advisable to have a capitalist or two, if possible, in a corporation like the Council of Dublin if you can get them there, a corporation, one part of whose principal business will be the promotion and development of <Col N="1002" /> the interests of the City of Dublin and the raising of large loans for that particular purpose.  I suggest that if anyone will be useful for giving advice there that a man with business interests will be useful.  It is a problem to solve and the taking of people of that particular type on will help it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell says that they can get on on a normal register.  We are not interested in can they get on.  The question is, do they get on? This seems a way of giving what I might call functional representation to a type who have an interest in the city, people who are not merely property owners but business men and who give employment.  That is what is at the basis of this particular franchise that is objected to. These are the main points of the Bill.  They are the points dealt with in Deputy O'Connell's speech.  I suggest we have here a real effort to advance a very definite step in the direction of better government for the capital of this country.  I suggest that none of the arguments that have been used by the mover of this amendment or the supporter of this amendment would be sufficient to induce the House to vote against the Bill on these particular grounds.  It contains these principles and we are prepared to face the vote of the House on the merits of these particular principles.</P>

      <P>I must protest against the Minister for Education's statement that a man was in the past not elected for his special ability as a civic administrator.  As perhaps the oldest citizen of Dublin here at present I must say that I always rejoice that Alderman W.T. Cosgrave and Alderman S.T. O'Kelly were, in the eyes of the public, elected for their special administrative ability and business acumen to the Corporation of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I think that the proposal for the future local government of the City of Dublin which is contained in this Bill had been killed before this debate commenced, and has not been revived by the speeches we have just heard from the Minister <Col N="1003" /> for Local Government and the Minister for Education.  Before the corpse is finally interred, I would like to take a hand in the post mortem examination, because I think we might possibly get some ideas that will be of use when we do attempt to tackle this problem of the future government of the capital of the State.  The most remarkable thing about this Bill, in my opinion, is the fact that not one single voice outside the Executive Council has been raised in unqualified support of it. Every political section of the community and every class of the citizens of Dublin have, through their representative, condemned this Bill more or less with qualifications.  We have seen, on the one hand, where the Trades Union Council called on this Dáil unanimously to reject it.  We have seen where such a representative business man as the Chairman of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, Mr. McGloughlin, said that if the position in Dublin is to be similar to the ridiculous position existing in Cork, where the council has no control over the City Manager, in his opinion no sensible man would seek a place on the council.  &ldquo;If that is to be the position,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I think the council ought to be boycotted.&rdquo; That proposal to boycott the council which it is proposed to establish under this Bill might conceivably have come from some supporter or some member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It might even have come from some member or supporter of the Labour Party.  But when we find it coming from such an individual as the Chairman of the Port and Docks Board we must come to the conclusion that this Bill is fundamentally rotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think when we come to the examination of this Bill we will have very little difficulty in deciding that it is bad.  It is not merely bad in principle, but it has been badly drafted.  It has been so badly drafted that I think it is impossible for it to be amended in Committee.  If there is any Deputy here under the illusion that he will be able to convince the <Col N="1004" /> Minister for Local Government as to the inadvisability of any particular part of the Bill in Committee and that, therefore, the Bill can be given a Second Reading in the hope that such a change would be effected, I would ask that Deputy seriously to endeavour to set down in writing the amendment which he would move to effect the alteration which he thinks should be made.  Any Deputy doing that will, I think, come to the conclusion that not merely is this Bill rotten in principle, as I have said, but is so drafted as to be practically incapable of amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has produced a number of rather ingenious arguments to justify some of its provisions.  The extraordinary procedure which has been adopted in relation to this question of local government in Dublin makes it almost impossible to hope that any Bill which the existing Government framed could be anything better than the present one.  The City Council was abolished in 1924 and Commissioners were established in place of them.  The Greater Dublin Commission was established to consider the question of municipal government as a whole, and to bring in recommendations as to the manner in which the charter of the Corporation could be altered after the Commissioners' term of office had expired. That Commission, as Deputy O'Kelly said, went to great trouble in the collection of evidence.  It spent a long time in the preparation of its report and when its report was prepared and produced it lay in the office of the Minister for Local Government for four years, and at the end of the four years was torn up. Apparently the members of the Executive Council think that they can afford to ignore every opinion which is contrary to their own preconceived ideas.  Why, however, they went through this farce of establishing a Commission, of printing that Commission's report, at the public expense, merely for the sake of ignoring its recommendations, I cannot see.</P>
    <P>Take this matter of the new city <Col N="1005" /> which it is proposed to establish in the southern side of Dublin.  Deputies and Ministers have referred to it as the coastal borough.  That is a term taken from the report of the Greater Dublin Commission and which is not contained in the Bill. The proposal in the Bill is altogether contrary to the proposal contained in the Greater Dublin Commission's report.  The coastal borough which the Greater Dublin Commission contemplated was to be a body subordinate to the municipal council and limited in its functions to matters which were of concern only to the areas to be included in it. Even that proposal to establish the subordinate coastal borough within the area of Greater Dublin was accepted very reluctantly by the Greater Dublin Commission.  If this Bill contained the proposal of the Greater Dublin Commission in that respect unaltered I would still be opposed to it.  There is one city here on Dublin Bay and one only, and we want that city under one authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education asked that some attempt should be made to show that a community of interests exists between the townships of Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire and the old city.  Why is it not the duty of the Minister for Local Government, who introduced this Bill, to show that such a community of interests does not exist?  Why are we to take it for granted that the specially privileged communities which were established by the British Government represent the natural order of things with which we must not interfere without good cause?  Surely there should be a presumption in favour of the existence of one city only and that that city should not be divided into separate administrative areas without very good cause indeed.  This proposal to establish a coastal borough can only be carried into effect at very great cost to the taxpayers.  I hope that point is appreciated by every Deputy.</P>

      <P>No case, I say, has yet <Col N="1006" /> been made out to convince this House that its establishment is necessary. We will consider later the few arguments that have been advanced, but before doing so let us consider the overwhelming nature of the case which can be made against it.  Not one Deputy&mdash;not even the Deputy who is interrupting, for example&mdash;has told us what particular argument exists for having duplicated control in relation to such services as main drainage, water supply, public lighting, road-making, fire brigade.  Are we going to have a repetition of the old system by which when a fire occurred anywhere near the city boundary the captains of the fire brigades drove out with a map of their area in their hands, and before they could turn a hose to extinguish the flames they would have to be satisfied that the fire was within their functional area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that main drainage in the coastal borough could in any way be co-operated with the main drainage of the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to consider this question of the drainage in the coastal borough, there is another matter to be taken into account.  The citizens of the City of Dublin have a considerable interest in the drainage system of the coastal borough.  At present the drainage is emptied on the foreshore of Dublin where the poor children from the Dublin tenements go to take their holidays.  The ratepayers of this coastal borough may be effecting some sort of saving by that system, but I say that any municipal council that had the interests of the poor Dublin people at heart would not permit that system to continue. The main drainage of the coastal borough is emptied untreated into the waters of Dublin Bay, the only place where the vast majority of our citizens can get a summer holiday. They cannot all go to the Riviera when they feel tired of working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take such questions as the registration of jurors and voters, of maternity and child-welfare, school <Col N="1007" /> attendance, reformatories and industrial schools, and technical education, what case has been made out by anybody in support of duplicating systems of administration in respect of these services?  Take the question of food inspection.  It has been stated to me by individuals who are prepared to stand over their statements that the system of food inspection at present in operation in the township of Dun Laoghaire, is corrupt to the core.  Is that system to continue in operation unchecked? Do Deputies not think that we could get a better system of administration in respect of that service if we had unified control for the whole city? Not merely, therefore, do the Government propose to duplicate these services in the City of Dublin, to maintain dual staffs, dual managers and dual equipment, but there is nothing in this Bill to provide that there will even be consultation between the two councils in respect of them.  So complete is the separation that no link whatever is maintained. Do Deputies think that that is going to make for efficiency? Do they think that this duplication in respect of essential services is going to make for economy?  If the business men of the City of Dublin have any interest in this Bill, that interest should be to secure the most efficient form of administration at the lowest price.  In respect of this one matter, at any rate, the most efficient form of administration, at the lowest price, could be secured by having one authority for the City of Dublin which extends around the whole Bay.</P>
    <P>There are other questions which the Minister did not deal with.  Will this Dun Laoghaire Borough Council have control over the harbour at Dun Laoghaire?  Is this Dun Laoghaire Borough Council to be free to develop that harbour in competition with the port of Dublin?  Are we going to have a trade war between the two councils in respect of that service?  Some Deputies, at any rate, know that the transference of the passenger services from the North Wall to Dun Laoghaire harbour <Col N="1008" /> resulted in a considerable loss of revenue to the Port and Docks Board, involving an increase in tonnage dues and consequent diversion of traffic to the ports of Belfast and Cork.  If the Dun Laoghaire Council is to be free to develop the State-subsidised harbour at Dun Laoghaire in competition with the Dublin port, then we can contemplate a further increase in harbour dues here and a further diversion of traffic from Dublin.  What case has been made for the proposal? We have been told that there is no natural boundary to the city.  We can make a boundary to the city, whether it is natural or unnatural. We are told by the Ministerially-inspired editor of &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; that we should contemplate the spectacle of the street cleansing machines starting out from the depôt on the quays to sweep the streets of the Dun Laoghaire borough.  What a wasteful method of administration! The only service in respect of which that inspired leader-writer was able to offer any case for dual administration was in regard to street-cleaning. Apparently the imagination of Ministers and of their supporters does not run the length of contemplating the establishment of a separate depôt in Dun Laoghaire, not necessarily under separate control.</P>
    <P>Has any other case been made for duplication?  I say deliberately that the only case that exists for the establishment of this city at Dun Laoghaire is a political one.  It has nothing whatever to do with the interests of the ratepayers, nor with the efficiency of these services.  This separate borough is being set up because the political interests of Cumann na nGaedheal so require it. It may be thought necessary that we should have a Mayor who would harmonise with the background at Dun Laoghaire pier when distinguished foreign visitors are about to arrive.  It may be thought undesirable that members of the Government should take the risk of a democratically elected Mayor from the City of Dublin rubbing shoulders <Col N="1009" /> with them on such occasions at Dun Laoghaire harbour.  Therefore, they think it is necessary to get one of the right colour to fill that rôle.  It may be that the Government were given to understand by a section of their supporters who have shown in the past that they exercise the most influence in their councils, that their continued support for Cumann na nGaedheal was dependent upon their being kept within this imperialistic reservation.  Deputies will not deny that the separate councils of Rathmines and Pembroke were established for political reasons. Any Deputy who has any doubts on that matter can resolve them for himself by looking up the history of these two bodies.  These councils were set up because the members of one political section could always be certain of having a majority on them.  I suggest that identical reasons have operated to secure the establishment of this city at Dun Laoghaire.  I hope, no matter what case can be made for every other provision in the Bill, that it will be rejected because of the inclusion in it of this one particular proposal.</P>
    <P>When we consider the question of establishing this second city at Dun Laoghaire, we have also to consider the question of the area it is proposed to include under the municipal council.  Reference has been made in the debate to the necessity for town planning.  Proposals were put forward by the Greater Dublin Commission in respect of this new service of town planning.  These proposals have been rejected by the Government while offering no alternative proposals.  There is nothing in the Bill concerning town planning. The Minister talks of consultations between the two borough councils in this respect.  It is not consultation that is wanted.  We can consult and discuss the matter as much as we choose.  There have been consultations about this question for 20 years, but nothing has been done.  What is required is legislative power, in the hands of some executive authority, so that the question can be properly dealt with. <Col N="1010" /> If we want to secure that the growth of the City of Dublin will be properly regulated, we must have not merely a town planning authority but around the city a belt of virgin land on which building has not yet begun and over which any development that takes place can be properly controlled.  We do not want to have cement villas, with red tiles strung out along all the roads around Dublin, offering no attractiveness from the point of view of rural beauty.  We want to see some authority in existence that will ensure that the amenities around Dublin will not be spoiled by the speculative builder.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly proposals in the Bill to provide for the inclusion in the borough area of areas which it is not proposed to include now.  Apparently the idea is that as soon as unurbanised areas have become urbanised in any way that they like, without regulation and without control, they can be brought within the city.  The growth of the capital is to be left to chance.  That particular defect in the Bill has been criticised more than any other by that section of the Government supporters which is vocal through the columns of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and such organs as the &ldquo;Irish Statesman.&rdquo; I think it is likely, in consequence of that fact, that we will be able to get the Government to change its attitude in that respect before the Bill becomes an Act.</P>

      <P>We are always glad to get a surprise from the Government. As a rule, we can foretell with considerable accuracy what they are going to do.  We will wait for the surprise.  Coming to the constitution of the council, the Minister for Local Government, in introducing this measure, gave the impression that the question of securing adequate representation for particular interests was not considered. In fixing the size of the council the only question taken into account was the number required to <Col N="1011" /> secure the efficient carrying out of the work of the council.  This theory that a legislative council improves in efficiency in inverse proportion to its numbers is, I think, fundamentally unsound.  If, however, there is anything in the idea the Minister did not explain to us why twenty-five members represent the acme of efficiency in the case of the City of Dublin, but fifteen have equal virtue in reference to the Dun Laoghaire Borough.  If we are to leave out of account altogether the number of voters per representative and think only of the numbers required to secure a proper atmosphere for the discussion of policy, then we have to compare the proposed council in Dublin with this Dáil.  Surely, if twenty-five members of the Dublin Borough Council represent the most efficient machine which can be devised by the Executive Council for deciding policy in respect of Dublin City, a similar number should be equally effective in deciding policy for the country?  Size does not matter, population does not matter, the relative importance of the question does not matter.  It is the actual working of the council only that matters, according to the Minister for Local Government.  I say we cannot leave out of account the question of representation.  We want to secure that every considerable interest amongst the ratepayers will have a representative on the municipal council.  We want to get upon that council the greatest possible variety of views consistent with efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And sanity.  We want to secure that a body of citizens, numbering for example 10,000, with some special interest common to them, will be able to elect at least one representative on the borough council to speak for them.  Is there any objection to that principle?  Is there any reason to believe that a council consisting of forty members, say, would not be able effectively to carry out the very limited powers which it is proposed <Col N="1012" /> to give it under this Bill?  What has been the experience in relation to the Cork City Council?  The average attendance at meetings of that council has been less than one-half the total membership.  That may be explainable by the fact that the powers of the council were so curtailed. I hold there would have been a better opportunity of having the affairs of Cork properly discussed if a larger council had been established in the first instance.  Members of the Executive Council are, I think, always mixing up the idea that for executive purposes a small committee is more useful than a large one with the idea of a legislative council.  For the purpose of legislation what is required is a proper representation of the views of all the people concerned.  For the purpose of administration you want merely unity of control.  The proposal to unify the administrative functions of the corporation in one individual is in our opinion good, and we are prepared to accept it, but we think that the legislative functions of the corporation cannot be possibly carried out unless the basis of representation is much wider than that proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Another remarkable result of the operation of the Cork City Management Act has been that practically no public interest whatever exists in Cork in the actions of the council. Any citizen of Cork, the members of Cumann na nGaedheal in this House, the members of Cumann na nGaedheal on the Cork Council, the members of Cumann na nGaedheal whom President Cosgrave met at a recent reception, every one of them, I am sure, would have told him if he asked them that public interest in the activities of the Cork Council was non-existent.  The reason for that is that the basis of representation is too small.  That was only one reason, I admit.  The absence of powers which they should have was another.  Let us come now to the question of the commercial register.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the <Col N="1013" /> powers in due course.  I want to deal with the constitution of the council first.  There is a theory current, not merely in this country but outside it, that democracy is on its trial.  It is on its trial quite a long time.  Let us in regard to this proposal conduct one part of the trial.  Let us call some witnesses for the defence.  I will call President Cosgrave as the first witness.  He will testify, I think, from his experience as a member of Dublin Corporation that he did not find administrative ability was the monopoly of any one class. He found good administrators and bad administrators amongest the business men on that body, and he found good administrators and bad administrators amongst representatives of labour on that council.  The President will not deny that, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the President might have forgotten.  He stated that fact in this House before the Bill was drafted.  Nevertheless, he is assenting to this proposal, which has as its fundamental idea the theory that only amongst the business community can good corporators be found.  I want the Minister for Local Government to tell me one State or one country in the world where this idea of a business man's Government has proved workable. We have had a lot of talk about the necessity of getting business men into the Dáil and Corporation, but why cannot we judge by the experience of other people?  Can we find one place where the idea of the business man in politics was carried on with successful results?  I do not think so.  The only interest which the business man has is the question of presenting a balance-sheet at the end of the year.  That is all right in business, but it is only of minor importance in politics.  In political affairs principles come into operation.  The business man is not trained to consider principles at all, and he is concerned only with profits, but profits have no place in municipal government, and no one emphasised that theory more forcibly <Col N="1014" /> than the President and Vice-President of the Executive Council.  The theory that riches constitute a criterion of efficiency is, as I said by way of interruption earlier in the debate, inherited from antediluvian times.  The principles on which this particular section of the Bill was framed were current in the days of Neanderthal man.</P>
      <P>We have had some talk as to whether the old municipal council was or was not corrupt.  We have had from both sides of the House assurances that it was not corrupt in recent years but that before the basis of representation was widened and when we had a strict property qualification in relation to the Corporation there was any amount of corruption in the municipal affairs of Dublin.  In any case the absolute amount which an individual pays is of no importance.  I have no doubt that President Cosgrave pays a much larger amount in rates than I do but I have equally no doubt that proportionately he pays less.  It is the amount which a man pays in proportion to his total resources that matters.  The Minister for Local Government gave an example of the possibility of Ford's coming here and establishing a factory and he asked whether the Ford Company should have only the same say in municipal affairs as the caretaker in the Concern would have.</P>

The Government are proposing to give to these business interests much more than they have asked for.  We want to know why that is so.

      <P>As I was saying, all citizens pay proportionately the same amount in rates, and are consequently all equally concerned as to the manner in which rates are spent.  The system which it is proposed to establish by this Bill is going to give preferential treatment to foreign companies with rateable property in Dublin.  I have been elected to represent 11,000 citizens, but I will have less say in the election of the Municipal Council than several foreign companies, whose only interest in the city is to make as much profit as possible out of the citizens.  Why should we permit a firm like Burton's to have a say in the election of the Dublin Municipal Council, irrespective of the rates they pay?  This Bill is copied from the constitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  We are the only port in the world, so far as I have been able to discover, that permits foreign shipowners to have a vote in the election of the harbour board. We are going to translate this magnificent new principle into municipal affairs and allow foreigners to elect the municipal council by giving them half a dozen votes, whereas <Col N="1016" /> the ordinary citizen can only get one.  I hope that there will be found in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party some people, at any rate, with sufficient interest in public affairs to vote against this antediluvian proposal. The principle that a person should be able to exercise political influence according to his wealth is the negation of democracy.  Democracy, of course, is not fashionable now.  We heard a speech from the Minister for Education deriding democracy.  Since he has been attending assemblies of the League of Nations at Geneva and rubbing shoulders with Mussolini he has come back to let the light shine on the darkness of our Victorian ignorance. Certainly we have learned more about democracy from the Minister for Education this evening than we learned from our own experience since 1918 at any rate.</P>

    <Title>Debate on the Adjournment.&mdash;County Cork Searches for Arms.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given notice that on the Motion for the Adjournment I would raise a matter about which I put questions to the Minister for Justice to-day, concerning raids for arms by detective officers <Col N="1017" /> in County Cork.  He stated that those raids were conducted under a search warrant, but I wish to know from him whether any hour was stated in the warrant at which those detectives were to carry out the raids or whether any date was put into it.  I think that we should have got beyond the time when detectives can enter a dwelling-house in the middle of the night.  They have plenty of time for raiding from 7 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock at night.  If they had to raid they could do so between those hours.  Instead of that, however, the first raid to which I refer took place at 11.30 p.m., when they entered a house, took this unfortunate boy, who was ill and who is under the doctor's care, dragged him out through the door and threatened him with assault.  They did not ask him for arms but where certain documents were, and when his sister followed him out to give him a scarf they used filthy language to her.  The Minister will, of course, deny all these statements and state that these detective officers are above suspicion of any kind.  I know what the Minister's attitude is of old on these matters, and though I have half an hour to-night to deal with the Minister I would prefer, and I am sure I would convince him a lot better, if I had him somewhere else for only a quarter of an hour.  I suppose that the Minister will accept the word of these detectives as gospel despite any evidence, brought against them, but I am glad to say that that is not the view of his Courts as one of these detectives has been twice convicted of assault.</P>

      <P>Then he should know the dates on which they committed those assaults.  On one occasion one of these detectives put a man's arm out of joint and was fined £2 in the Midleton District Court.  The second raid took place at 1.30 o'clock on a Sunday morning, evidently because they did not get satisfaction in the first house.  The raid occupied two hours.  They dragged this man out of bed, ordered him to dress, hardly gave him any time to do so, and then ordered him out into the yard while the others were inside searching.  When he got back to his house finally he found the furniture broken up and the house in such a condition that he was unable to make his breakfast.  If those raids are going to be continued, apparently with the patronage of the Minister, the citizens of the State will have to raise some fund to equip defence forces against the Minister's Black and Tans.  There is nothing else for it.  I have seen night after night cases such as this brought up here but not half of them are mentioned here.  I tell the Minister that I would take that young man's word before I would take the word of ten or fifteen of his Tans. These are not raids by uniformed forces and, so far as I can see, the majority of the uniformed Guards are decent men.  There are, however, forces under the Minister's control apparently, or under no control whatever, who are constantly committing these outrages in the country in order to keep their own jobs.  What firearms did they expect to find at 1.30 a.m. which they would not expect to find at 7 o'clock in the morning?  Of course, it is all very well to find excuses but if the Minister thinks that a gentleman who has already been fined £2 for assault is a fit person to raid any man's house at 1 o'clock in the morning I think it is a strange thing. I gave these people advice before and I say now that if uniformed men do not accompany these highwaymen these people should treat them as they would treat any other robber and if there are arms in the house they should give them a dose of <Col N="1019" /> them.  Nobody knows whether they are robbers or not until the door is opened and until they break into the house.  At 1.30 in the morning these gentlemen come into a dwelling-house and adopt that attitude.  Therefore I make a last appeal to the Minister to control these people and, if he cannot, he should say so and let somebody else get in who will control them or attempt to do so.  We know that the Minister will say:&mdash;&ldquo;These are the kinds of complaints which I get every day of the week.  This is the frame of mind in which Deputies approach me.  These are cases without any foundation which are constantly coming up before us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the view of the judge of the District Court who fined this gentleman twice.  Of course, apparently the Minister is put up as a kind of cockshot to have every argument rebutted, and to say: &ldquo;These things did not happen, and there it ends.&rdquo;  I can, however, promise the Minister that it is not going to end there, and I can promise him that, as that area was defended before against Tans as bold as his Tans, it will, if necessary, be defended again.  It is time to call a halt and if the Minister does not call a halt there are people in Ireland who will call a halt to them.  If the Minister contends that it is right to have a man who has been twice convicted of assault kept in a district to terrorise law-abiding inhabitants <Col N="1020" /> it is time that we knew where we are.  I have repeatedly brought cases of assault to the Minister's attention and have always got the same satisfaction, namely, none.  If the elected representatives of the people are not able to protect such inhabitants then we will adopt other means.  I can tell the Minister that I am not going to allow any constituent of mine to be blackguarded by any Tan of his.  I will not waste time listening to the Minister's reply because I know what it is.</P>

      <P>It was a rather interesting speech to which we have just listened.  Here is a gentleman who masquerades as a member of this House and who states:&mdash;&ldquo;If there are arms in the house I would advise them to let them have a dose of them.&rdquo;  That means that the Deputy has deliberately incited his constituents to murder. He made a lot of statements but not in one of them did he give the slightest evidence.  As a matter of fact, the gentleman on whose behalf he purported to speak, Thomas Murray, made a statement to the Guards to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;The detective officers&rdquo; (he mentioned their names) &ldquo;did not make use of any obscene language to my sister or to me.  I was suffering from a cold at the time, but I was not too bad.  I was working around as usual.&rdquo;  That shows the complete want of regard for the truth which animates Deputy Corry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On consideration of their investigator's report on the public inquiry in respect of objections to the Erkina River Drainage Scheme, the Commissioners of Public Works decided to make some minor alterations in the scheme, thereby causing a reduction in the estimated increase in the annual present value of the lands affected.  The effect of this reduction is to increase the free grants required to make the scheme economic for the occupiers of affected lands from 68½% to 75% of the actual cost of the scheme.  Since the maximum grant made by the Government in aid of drainage schemes is 50% of the actual cost, the increased grant required, i.e., 6½% of the cost, must be forthcoming from the Laoighis County Council if the scheme is to proceed.  The County Council have accordingly been asked to increase their contribution in aid of this scheme from 18½% to 25% of the cost and, if that body agrees to make the increased contribution, the Commissioners will have the scheme submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation with a view <Col N="873" /> to starting works.  A copy of the Commissioners' letter to the County Council is being sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, as has been explained to the Deputy in reply to a question in November last, actual drainage works cannot be begun in this district until about the end of spring.</P>

In giving decisions on appeal on 18th January, 1929, when a pension of 9/- a week was allowed, and on 21st January, 1930, when it was determined that the pensioner was not entitled to a pension at a higher rate than 9/- a week, it was held on the evidence furnished that the value of Miss Murray's maintenance by her <Col N="875" /> brother on his farm of 17 acres of land (Poor Law valuation £5 15s.) with four and a half acres of tillage, and carrying three cows, exceeded £15 12s. 6d., but did not exceed £18 5s. a year.</P>

The claimant did not furnish her birth or baptismal certificate. On the particulars furnished by her no record was found in the Marriage Register of her marriage during the period 1884 to 1887.  Declarations were received from two neighbours which were not, however, considered sufficiently relevant or conclusive to warrant the allowance of a pension.  As it was not clear that the claimant fulfilled the statutory qualification as to age the claim was disallowed on the 8th February, 1930.  In the circumstances the question of her means was not fully considered.  I have now no functions in relation to the case and am not empowered to intervene now in regard to it.</P>
