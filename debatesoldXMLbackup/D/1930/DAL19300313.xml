      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. A.J. Byrnes, Newcastle West, was imprisoned in Limerick Jail on a writ of levari for non-payment of income tax, and that after spending twelve weeks in prison he was released unconditionally without paying the amount of the tax for which he was imprisoned; that it is alleged that Mr. Byrnes was imprisoned as a result of an error made in his assessment, and if he will state whether any communications have been received from Mr. Byrnes or his solicitor on the matter, and if he will make a statement on the present position of the case.</P>

      <P>Mr. A.J. Byrnes was committed to prison on a writ of levari issued from the High Court for non-payment of income tax arrears amounting to £68 14s. 6d. properly assessed and payable, and was detained for the period stated.  There is no ground for the suggestion that an error was made in assessing Mr. Byrnes in respect of his income, or that the assessments were not in order.  He was released on the 2nd May, 1929, and the matter is, therefore, ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to agree to postpone consideration of this measure for six months when the matter will be dealt with in Government time.  The Bill was introduced into the Seanad by an individual Senator, with the co-operation of the Institute of Architects, and deals with a very important matter.  It will throw a very considerable amount of work on local authorities, and a very considerable amount of work and supervision on the Department of Local Government.  Therefore, it is a Bill, the general principles of which, as well as the drafting, will require very careful and systematic review in the Department before I could agree that it was a satisfactory measure to pass into legislation.  The matter is important, and it has been given a very considerable amount of attention in the Department up to the present. We have had to place it in our work in its proper perspective, and give it the particular place in our list that we thought the subject, as compared with the others we are dealing with, was entitled to.  We will have to take the Dublin Bill and the Traffic Bill before we can effectively deal with the subject of town planning. I did not come in on the consideration to this matter, but I went to the Seanad on the Fifth Stage and explained my position, and, I think, satisfied that House that really the subject would be prejudiced by an attempt to deal with it here at an earlier date than that suggested by me.  By that time, I hope to be in the necessary position to give the House the benefit of the results of Departmental examination of the position.  I am therefore suggesting to the House to put down the Second <Col N="1796" /> Reading of the Bill for this day six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the matter is one of very considerable importance but, at the same time, it is one that has been before the Seanad for a very long time, and has been the subject of consideration by a Special Committee.  During the time that it has been before the Oireachtas it appears to us that there ought to have been time for the officials of the Local Government Department to make the necessary inquiries as to how it would affect particular areas.  Some of us had the idea that it might be possible for the Minister and his Department to have given such consideration to the subject of town planning as to enable them to adapt whatever sections of the Bill that they thought were adaptable, and to have them embodied in the Local Government Bill that is now before the House.  Some people who have given a good deal of consideration to the matter were of opinion that there are principles embodied in the Town Planning and Rural Amenities Bill that could, with reason and with advantage, be embodied in the Local Government (Dublin) Bill.  I think there was an idea in some people's minds, too, that if it was not the intention of the Government to introduce broadly the principle of town planning as outlined in this Bill into the Local Government Bill dealing with the extension of the boundaries of Dublin, it might have been possible for some members of the House to put down amendments to the Dublin Bill.  That is a hypothetical question which there is no use putting to you now, sir, but there was an idea that it might have been possible to introduce some of these principles by way of amendments into that Bill, and perhaps it would be possible to do so even still.  We did think that concurrently with the discussion of the Greater Dublin Bill as it is technically called, it would be possible to discuss this Town Planning Bill, and so make the legislation run concurrently, and make the town planning <Col N="1797" /> principles available when the Local Government Bill would have become law.</P>
      <P>We are not satisfied that this matter should be postponed for six months.  We think that it ought to be dealt with as soon as possible, and we think that when the Local Government (Dublin) Bill is being considered the town planning principles ought to be considered and discussed at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister desires is that the order should be set down for this day six months for the Second Reading of this Bill, giving it at that point Government time.  If an order were made under those conditions any other member of the House could not move the Second Reading of this Bill at an earlier point.  If nobody moves the Second Reading of the Bill it goes off the Order Paper.  We will allow the matter to stand over until next week and see what Deputies intend to do about it.  In general, that is the position.  If nobody likes to put down a motion for the Second Reading the Bill is simply removed from the Order Paper.  It might be taken by a private Deputy in Private Deputies' time, or it might be taken by the Minister when he is satisfied to take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We might leave it over for a week, but I think Deputy O'Kelly will see that the Town Planning Bill and the Local Government (Dublin) Bill are two very different matters, and that the Town Planning Bill can be much more satisfactorily discussed completely detached from any particular area.  Town planning is important from the Dublin point of view and from the point of view of Cork and the bigger areas, but I think it would <Col N="1798" /> be found more satisfactory to discuss it in a detached way and apart from any special consideration of Dublin. Again, there will not be Government time for this measure before the summer; I think that that must be clear when we take into consideration the amount of financial business that has to be got through and the amount of Private Deputies' business that is still on the Paper.  I doubt if any party in the House could have given consideration to the very important principles that are involved in this measure, and I think that the matter will not suffer at all from the mature consideration that can be given to it during the next six months.  I would deprecate an important subject like this being put down for consideration during Private Deputies' time, because I think that the discussion would be unsatisfactory and would be prejudiced. It is definitely a fact that while a very considerable amount of attention and consideration has been given to this matter, I cannot offer to the House within the next few months the full and ripe results of Departmental consideration that the House would be entitled to.  I think everyone will appreciate that if a measure like this had been introduced as a private measure I would have had to oppose it, because it is essentially a measure which requires a very great amount of Departmental consideration.  If we allow the matter to stand over for a week I think we will have a clear understanding of what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Section 1.  The word &ldquo;is&rdquo; deleted in line 30 and before the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 31 the following words inserted:&mdash;&ldquo;is sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann for its recommendations under Article 38 of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill after leaving the Dáil was to the effect that seven days would run from the day of the certificate given by the Ceann Comhairle. The Seanad have passed an amendment substituting for that &ldquo;the day on which a Bill certified by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann to be a Money Bill is sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann for its recommendations under Article 38 of this Constitution.&rdquo;  I think probably what was in mind in this connection was that if a Bill were to pass the House here at a minute to 12 midnight, only six days would run if the date were to be from the certificate by the Chairman.  I do not know if there is any other point in it.  It is an inconsiderable alteration, <Col N="1800" /> and in that case perhaps a day might be lost.  Seven days is considered short enough without practically restricting it to six.  There is no real point in it.</P>

      <P>Section 1.  The words &ldquo;Article 38 of this Constitution&rdquo; deleted in lines 32-33 and the words &ldquo;the said Article 38&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>The second amendment is consequential.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, lines 41-47 inclusive deleted and the following words substituted therefor:&mdash;&ldquo;the question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall forthwith be referred to a Committee of Privileges consisting of such number (not exceeding three) of members (if any) as shall be elected by Dáil Eireann within seven days after such reference, such number (not exceeding three) of members (if any) as shall be elected by Seanad Eireann within such seven days, and a Chairman who shall be the senior Judge of the Supreme Court able and willing to act and who in the case of an equality of votes, but not otherwise, shall be entitled to vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments 3 and 4 have relation to the Constitution of the Committee of Privileges.  As the Bill left the Dáil, it was thought in the Seanad that by the refusal of any member to serve or of either House to appoint the three members that possibly the Committee would not function and these two amendments make provision for the Committee functioning and make provision for the quorum and the appointment of a Chairman in the event of the Chairman being prevented by illness or any other cause from attending <Col N="1801" /> What was really in the mind of the Seanad in regard to it was in the event of illness or any other cause preventing a member from attending there was no provision for the Committee functioning in the absence of the full number.  This particular amendment I think fulfils the two conditions, one that either House might not appoint members to attend on the Committee of Privileges and, two, in the event of a vacancy arising the Committee can function notwithstanding the fact that there is one short in number.  I think that there is nothing very material in the alteration and it satisfies the misgivings that were expressed in connection with the functioning of the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain points arising out of this amendment to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  Deputies will remember that when this Bill first came before the Dáil certain Deputies on this side of the House put themselves to great pains to convince the President that the Bill did not in fact achieve what he asserted it was designed to achieve. On the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage we urged that the increased power which it was proposed to give to the Seanad by this Bill in relation to Bills certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be Money Bills could be used for obstructionist purposes.  Despite the eloquence and the ability with which that case was put forward by Deputies on this side of the House, the President refused to be convinced for a very long time.  After we had argued the matter out on the Committee Stage we succeeded in getting into his head that there was some substance in our arguments.  The Bill was then hung up for a period of about 12 months, at the end of which time the President moved the Report Stage and introduced certain amendments designed to meet the particular points that we had drawn attention to.  The Bill then went to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that Deputies here saw the danger that the power given to the Seanad by the Bill would be used for <Col N="1802" /> obstructionist purposes.  The Seanad, on the other hand, saw the danger of the particular wording used in the proposed section of the Constitution giving powers to the Dáil to obstruct the functions of the Seanad in the same connection.  And therefore the Seanad have moved this amendment, designed to make obstruction by the Dáil impossible. Now Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal and the Seanad have all combined to try and make this proposed section of the Constitution workable.  Unfortunately, however, the material was bad in the first instance, and, despite the ability which Fianna Fáil brought to the task, I suggest that the section of the Constitution is not yet workable in all circumstances.  We have provided for the possibility of the Dáil refusing to appoint members on the Joint Committee.  We have provided for the possibility of the Seanad refusing to appoint members on the Committee of Privileges.  We have provided for the possibility of the Committee of Privileges failing to report within the 21 days specified, but there are certain other contingencies against which we have not yet safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Committee of Privileges shall consist of three members elected by the Seanad and three members elected by the Dáil and the Chairman who shall be a member of the Supreme Court able and willing to act.  Who appoints the Chairman?  Presumably the Government are responsible for the appointment of the Chairman.  Is there anything in this Bill which says that the Government must appoint a Chairman?  If the Government fail to appoint a Chairman can the Committee act, and if the Committee cannot act what happens to the Bill certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill in respect of which the certificate is questioned by the Seanad?  If there is no Judge of the Supreme Court willing to act what happens?  Can the Committee be constituted?  Can a Chairman be appointed?  Can the question of whether or not a Bill is a Money Bill be determined?  If we succeeded in <Col N="1803" /> getting members appointed by the Dáil and members appointed by the Seanad and a Judge of the Supreme Court appointed by the Government, who actually brings the Committee together?  Who appoints the time and place at which they meet and summons the first meeting?  If the person who might carry out that duty fails to do it what will the position be?  Will the Bill certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill become such without question after the expiration of the 21 days?  Is it anybody's duty to summon the Committee to meet or will we have the situation that three members of the Dáil will be available here, three members of the Seanad available in the other Chamber, a Judge of the Supreme Court available somewhere else and no machinery in existence by which they can be brought together and constituted as a Committee of Privileges.</P>
    <P>We spent a long time over this Bill.  It was ordered by Dáil Eireann to be printed on 31st October, 1929.  My recollection is that it was introduced before then.  It is Constitution (Amendment No. 12) Bill, 1928.  We spent a long time over it and since we have spent such a long time over it let us at least try to produce a workmanlike Act at the end.  We, the Fianna Fáil Party, are not particularly concerned about the Constitution, whether it is workable or not, but when that document goes abroad it is studied by Constitutional lawyers in other countries who are anxious to know the forms of Government here and we at least would like them to think that we can produce a workable Constitution.  I suggest to the President and the House that if Article 35 is amended as suggested here workable machinery will not be established in consequence thereof.  We have provided for certain contingencies, not for them all.  Even at this late hour the President can withdraw the Bill and ask for the co-operation of the Fianna Fáil Party in having a better one prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other point that occurs to me.  I note here that provision was made for a vacancy created by the death of the Chairman, but apparently there is no provision made to fill a vacancy created by the death or illness of any member of the Committee.  It arises more properly on Amendment 4.  Still it appears to me that that precaution has not been taken by the President.  I may say that I am perfectly certain that if we had taken this Bill half as seriously as the President took it in forcing it through the House by the methods he adopted, we would have riddled it with pot-holes by now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand that &ldquo;riddled with pot-holes.&rdquo; It is with some other instrument things are riddled not with pot-holes. As regards the first point mentioned by Deputy Lemass, I expect it will be the duty of the officers of either House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same way as any Committee of Privileges or Joint Committee are assembled in connection with any other matter to assemble the meeting.  As regards the appointment of the judge, I expect an officer of the House will do his duty in respect of that.  It would not be a question for the Government. As regards the third point mentioned by Deputy MacEntee, the amendment deals with the functioning of the Committee in the absence of a person, but it does not provide, or it was not intended to provide for replacing a member who would be incapable of acting or who died or resigned, or anything else of that sort.  Deputies will realise that there would not be a considerable amount of time available for that. <Col N="1805" /> In the first place, if, on the sixth day, objection was raised in accordance with the Constitution to the certificate, then both Houses would require to be summoned to elect their members.  That would take three or four days.  The Committee would then sit.  One man would be ill.  It would require to report back to either House and the House may have to be summoned again to elect its members.  It was thought that all that may not afford a sufficient length of time for the consideration of the business.  That was the reason why it was thought safer to provide for the functioning of the Committee in the absence of any one of its members, excepting, at all times, the Chairman.</P>

Supposing, as may happen, a very important matter is in dispute and this machinery is resorted to, you have a Committee set up of three members of the Seanad and three members of the Dáil.  Its decisions may affect the whole course of constitutional development in this country. One of the members of Dáil Eireann either dies or ceases to be a member of this House through some other cause, and the Government which is elected by this House and which is responsible to this House has made no provision whatever to deal with such an important contingency as that.  There would then be on this Committee of Procedure and Privileges three members representing the Seanad and only two members representing the Dáil.  As the three members presumably would be appointed to the Committee to uphold the position which had been taken up by the Seanad, this House, having <Col N="1806" /> elected a certain number of members to uphold the position taken up by the Dáil, would find itself in a minority upon the Committee, and would have no remedy whatsoever.  In such a situation the Committee may make such a report, as I said before, as would affect the whole course of constitutional development in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to what the Deputy first mentioned, that the Committee may have to decide some question on which the whole constitutional development would depend, that is not so.  They will meet to consider whether or not the decision of the Ceann Comhairle in deciding that a Bill was a Money Bill is correct, and they are confined to that.  There is no fear then of any constitutional danger with respect to that.  The next point is the danger of a member of the Dáil dying.  Happily that does not often occur, but there is a danger, I think of some of them being talked to death.  The physique of the members of the Dáil, however, seems to be equal to it.  I would suggest that the Dáil in a case of this sort would select people who would not die or whom they would reasonably consider would not die during the consideration of this matter.</P>

      <P>No, but there is a reasonable amount of assurance.  I would advise them, at any rate, to keep in a state of grace so that they would be all right if anything should happen.  Time does not permit of the replacing of members of the Committee by reason of the lapse in the first instance of six days and the absorption of four or five days in calling the House together, the sitting of the Committee and the reporting back.  The twenty-one days would have run.  That was the objection to making provision for that. One really could not I think imagine an amendment of the Constitution bringing in three members who would be as it were a first team and in the event of anything happening <Col N="1807" /> to disqualify them or prevent them from attending having a second team ready.  I do not think it would be good business.  It has rarely happened in our experience and I think in the experience of the working of any Parliament that during the course of the business members appointed for a particular purpose such as this were incapacitated by reason of death.  It is an unlikely contingency and I do not think it necessary to provide for it.</P>

      <P>The more I listen to the President the more astonished I become at his lack of appreciation of the situation which might arise under this Bill.  Yet the Bill is a very simple one.  It is designed to deal entirely with Bills which though certified by the Ceann Comhairle as Money Bills have not been accepted as such by Seanad Eireann.</P>

      <P>Or by Dáil Eireann; shall we say for all practical purposes by Seanad Eireann?  If the Ceann Comhairle decides for the purposes of the Article of the Constitution that the Bill is a Money Bill, I hardly think his ruling in that matter is going to be questioned in this House.  The President says that there scarcely can be any dispute in connection with Money Bills. Has the President ever studied one of his own Finance Bills?  I am certain that if a person wished to raise a constitutional issue between the two Houses he could certainly say that it was questionable whether any of the Finance Bills that have gone from this House are Money Bills, because a Money Bill is very strictly defined by the Constitution as being a Bill which deals only with such-and-such matters.</P>

If such a contingency were to arise, then the next person in seniority would, I think, according to the wording of the Bill, be liable to bear all the responsibilities of the person who is senior to him.  I do not think there is any possible likelihood of being unprovided with a Judge of the Supreme Court according to this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The period during which the Seanad or the Dáil could question a ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, and also to extend the powers of the Seanad in another direction as well.  We tried to convince the <Col N="1809" /> President for a long period that the proposed new Article of the Constitution was defective, in so far as the machinery which it established might not work in all circumstances. After a long and tedious argumentation, we succeeded in convincing the President that we were right, and the President introduced an amendment, which is the last paragraph of the proposed Article, the purpose of which is to provide that if the Committee of Privileges does not report within twenty-one days, then the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle automatically becomes operative. The Bill as amended went to the Seanad.  The Seanad saw the possibility of the machinery breaking down in other directions, and they introduced the amendments which we are now discussing.  I say that neither here nor in the Seanad have we succeeded in making the proposed section fool-proof or accident-proof. The President may tell us that he expects the officers of the Dáil will summon the Committee.  If we have to insert an Article here to provide that a Committee consisting of three members of each House and the Chairman, who shall be a Judge of the Supreme Court, shall perform the function for which it is established, surely we should also have a provision that the officers of the Dáil, or those whose duty it is to constitute the Committee, shall carry out the duty as soon as the machinery starts to operate.  I cannot see the sense of passing a Bill putting in a new Article into the Constitution if there are conceivable circumstances in which that Article will not be able to meet the contingency against which it is intended to guard.  The Committee might possibly not be constituted; the Chairman might possibly not be appointed &mdash;under extraordinary circumstances, I mean; those whose duty it is&mdash;and it is not clear yet whose duty it is&mdash;to summon the Committee and appoint a Chairman might not do so.  Under conceivable circumstances there may not be a Judge of the Supreme Court willing to act.  There are only three Supreme Court Judges.</P>

      <P>It is possible that one of them may not be willing to act; it is possible that, under pressure of business, one of them may not be able to act.  What is going to happen in that case?  That is the point I want made clear.  The President may tell us that it is not likely that these circumstances will arise. I want to know what will happen if they do arise?  We must provide against the contingency.  If a Bill is passed by the Dáil and certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill, and if the Seanad sees fit to question the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, what happens that Bill if, because of any of the circumstances I have mentioned, this Committee cannot be set up to determine the question whether it is or is not a Money Bill?  Will that Bill be automatically regarded as a Money Bill at the end of the twenty-one days, or will there be a constitutional crisis?  We deplore constitutional crises; we dislike them very much; we hope they will never arise. It is to prevent the possibility of any such crisis taking place that I am putting this point of view to the President.  The President can do several things much more cleverly than members on this side of the House.  He can catch rainbows, as Deputy O'Connor told the people of the South City on Tuesday.  He has actually succeeded in catching rainbows, but he has not yet caught the strength of the argument with relation to the defects in this Bill. There are defects in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment of the Constitution has waited for two years.  If it waits for another year or two, or even ten years, it will not make any difference.  Before we pass it finally let us take steps to ensure that it will be perfect.  We do not want to have a defective Constitution if we can prevent it.  The Constitution goodness knows, is defective enough and let us not deliberately make it worse than it is.  Here is a Bill asking the Dáil to insert a new Article that is obviously capable of improvement. Let the President withdraw <Col N="1811" /> the Bill and ask for the advice of Fianna Fáil before attempting to tinker with the Constitution again and he will never make any more mistakes of this kind.  We promise to assist him to make the Constitution, in so far as it is humanly possible, a proper document.  This Article has defects in any case, and we will not get another opportunity of convincing the President of that. When, on the Second Reading, we tried to convince the President we did not succeed.  When the Bill came up in Committee, we tried to convince the President and we almost succeeded.  For twelve months, during which the Bill was hanging up, the President was discovering for himself the defects which we had been trying to point out to him.  It took a long time to convince the President that the proposed Article was defective.  Unfortunately, this is the last opportunity we shall have of attempting to convince him that the amendment which the Seanad has introduced does not provide against all the possible defects.</P>
    <P>If the President would agree to hang up the Bill for another twelve months it is quite possible that in that period he will realise that there is something in what we say, and then the Dáil will have again an opportunity of discussing fresh amendments that may be brought in.  I ask the President not to make the Constitution a laughing matter. I would ask him to treat the matter seriously, and certainly this Bill does not do so, and so I ask him to withdraw the Bill in its present form before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point in Deputy Lemass's speech that rather surprised me.  I understood that he was originally opposed to facilitating the Seanad, or a certain number of members of the Seanad, from contesting the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle as to whether a Bill was a Money Bill or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy was perfectly satisfied to give every facility, as is accorded in this Bill, to members of the Seanad to raise objections to the Ceann Comhairle's certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no. If I may explain to the President, what I want to have in the Constitution is some method by which, if the Seanad questions the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, the matter can be determined with some show of fairness to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Which in essence means that the Deputy wishes to have the Seanad facilitated in respect to an objection that it has to a Bill in certain circumstances being certified as a Money Bill by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the President that it is conceivable that the Dáil may have an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I reminded the Deputy of that.  He did not seem to relish that point.  I think Deputy MacEntee said that it would be inconceivable that members of the Dáil would object to the determination by the Ceann Comhairle that a Bill was a Money Bill.  It may be now that there is a slight division of opinion on the Front Bench opposite, and we will not proceed to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>They have two opinions as far as this measure is concerned.  If there was one point that Deputies opposite might be expected to hang on to, it would be that this question of determining whether the Bill was or was not a Money Bill should be settled within twenty-one days.  Now that is provided for.  No conceivable set of circumstances can arrest a decision being arrived at one way or another within twenty-one days.  If the Committee does not sit and if it does not function, if any unforeseen event happens, the determination of the Ceann Comhairle is final and conclusive at the end of twenty-one <Col N="1813" /> days.  The Deputy does not agree to that.  The fact is it is so long since the Deputy read the Bill that I think it would probably convenience him if it was left over for a while so that he might read it again, but he might take it from me that that is so.  The next point arises as to the misgivings that members of the Seanad had as to the machinery provided in order to deal with disputes as to whether or not a Bill was a Money Bill and to have it determined by the Committee of Privileges.  In that respect if the Deputy will look at the proceedings of the Seanad he will find that I took exception to certain of the proposals which they put up, but I facilitated them in interpreting their wishes in putting up either one or other of these two amendments in order to resolve the question, and it is resolved into the Constitution which we have and which is a written Constitution.  Whenever any question arises that has regard to a matter in a written Constitution it is easily understandable by persons otherwise perhaps incapable of appreciating the significance of the application.  As to whether or not the certification is correct or properly applied, I am not at all saying the Committee of Privileges would be better qualified than the Ceann Comhairle.  As a rule any question that would arise in connection with this matter would be a pure question of fact and, although the Seanad might elect three members to voice its views contrary to the view that had been expressed when the decision of the Ceann Comhairle was given upon the Bill, it is quite possible that one or two or the whole three might be satisfied that there was nothing in their contention, but it does not necessarily follow that one set of three members would be on the one side pro and three on the other side against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple, easily understandable and very wise method of having that particular difficulty or dispute or difference of opinion resolved, and I think the tortuous suggestions of Deputies opposite could not be better expressed than that <Col N="1814" /> they were at last driven to the view that no better solution of the difficulty that presents itself to them could be found than in these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain things that I want to point out.  In the first place, we are not concerned with the Constitution at all.  It is purely out of consideration for the President that we are raising these points.  Whether this section is passed as now proposed or whether it is amended in the manner we suggest does not worry us very much. We will not lose any sleep over it. I would remind the President there were certain sections in the Constitution that we tried to put into operation and found they would not work.  The machinery had got jammed or was never designed to work.  Perhaps the machinery this sets up is also not designed to work. It has been the experience of this House that the Constitution is capable of amendment and that those who framed the Constitution and have amended it have often made mistakes.  I suggest to the President that he is again making a mistake. I read the proceedings in the Seanad and the particular discussion seemed to be as to whether it was seven days after a Bill was sent up by the Dáil to the Seanad or seven days after it was received in the Seanad from the Dáil.  I read the Report and I think they discussed that for days and at last decided by a majority vote, but on the important matters I mentioned there was nothing at all.  The Seanad did not see the defective nature of the amendment that it was inserting.  I again ask the President to realise that we shall have no other opportunity of pointing out to him his error in this matter.  This is the last opportunity.  It the Bill goes through with this defective clause it is the President's responsibility and not ours.</P>

      <P>What is on the Order Paper is a Message from the Seanad saying that the Seanad has passed a particular Resolution. In accordance with Standing Orders and the practice of the House, a Message from the Seanad is put on the Order Paper next prepared after the Message is received.  The Minister or Deputy concerned, generally it is a Minister, announces to the House on that or some succeeding day his intention with regard to the <Col N="1817" /> Message from the Seanad.  The intention of the Minister to move concurrence with the Message from the Seanad was announced some days ago, last week I think.  All the Minister is doing now is moving that the Dáil concurs with the Seanad in this Resolution.  If the Dáil agrees to concur with the Seanad Resolution a Message will be sent to the Seanad acquainting them of that fact.  The Seanad will then proceed to set up a committee and a further motion will be required here to set up a committee on our side.  The Minister is not now proposing to set up a committee but he is taking an important step in that particular process by proposing concurrence.  It is not usual to put down a motion but it is usual to give notice of the intention of the Government.  In accordance with notice, the Minister is now moving concurrence.

      <P>&ldquo;Payment may be made by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to the members of the said consultative council or any committees thereof to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance in respect of the repayment of travelling expenses and the payment of subsistence allowances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was objected to for two reasons.  In the first place, in my view it was hardly necessary, because there is an existing Section 32, which says that &ldquo;all expenses of carrying this Act into effect shall, to such extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  If <Col N="1818" /> it is necessary to pay travelling expenses to the members of the consultative council, if set up, they can be paid by the Minister for Finance. I ask the Dáil to reject that, as the Seanad really imposed a new tax. The Seanad have taken the line that they are entitled to propose a new tax, and they insist on their amendment. They request a consultation between the two Houses, and I think it is only courtesy on the part of this House to meet the Seanad and talk the matter over as between our representatives and theirs.</P>

      <P>I regret that we cannot accept the position which has been taken up by the Minister for Justice in this matter.  We think that the action of the Seanad is one which does not permit of discussion between this House and the Seanad, and the mere holding of a conference might be held afterwards to be an acceptance of the principle that the Seanad has a right to impose what, as the Minister said, would be a fresh charge.  In view of the many attempts which the Seanad has made from time to time to encroach upon the rights of the Dáil in regard to financial matters, we think that the time has come when the Dáil should say to the Seanad that it is not prepared to discuss with the Seanad any further matters arising out of any unwarranted attempt on the part of the Seanad to secure for itself privileges and rights which are not conferred on it by the Constitution.  One of the reasons which strengthen us in that attitude is the fact that this particular amendment is altogether unnecessary. If the Seanad in amending the Bill thought that certain machinery should be set up, the expense of which should be borne out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, the Dáil itself had already taken steps to that end when it passed Section 32 of the Bill, which provides that &ldquo;all expenses of carrying this Act into effect shall, to such extent as shall be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  In view of that it <Col N="1819" /> would seem that the insertion of a sub-section into this new section was redundant and unnecessary and was merely a provocative attempt on the part of the Seanad to create for itself a privilege and a right which is denied to any private member in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the following Standing Order it is laid down that &ldquo;Every motion for any aid, grant or charge on the public revenue or for any charge upon the people shall be considered in Committee of the whole Dáil to be known as the Committee on Finance.&rdquo;  The Standing Order proceeds &ldquo;No such motion as aforesaid, nor any amendment thereto proposing to increase the amount named in any such motion may be made by any Deputy save a member of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  That is a very salutary provision because it means that those who have not the responsibility for administration should not have the power to create a fresh charge on the public purse. The members of this House have laboured under that restriction and the Ceann Comhairle has often imposed it on us.  I have no doubt that if sub-section 5 of this particular section had been moved by any private member of the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle would have ruled the motion out of order.  It certainly seems strange that the Seanad, which under the spirit of the Constitution, <Col N="1820" /> has no control whatever over financial matters should have liberty to insert an amendment of this kind in the Bill.  As I say I think it had been already pointed out to the members of the Seanad that the necessary financial provision had been made by Section 32 of the Bill as it left the Dáil.  I think in view of that fact, this House is not justified in meeting the Seanad any further in the matter.  Accordingly we do not agree with the motion of concurrence which the Minister has proposed.</P>

      <P>I would say that with almost everything in Deputy MacEntee's speech I am in agreement.  It does seem to be illogical, if it is the position, that the Seanad ought to be able to introduce an amendment which the leader of no Party in this House could introduce and which only could be moved from the Government benches.  I agree with Deputy MacEntee in that but I think that to preserve better relations between the two Houses it is very much better to meet the members of the Seanad and point out that to them.  I think it is an act of courtesy from one House to the other and I would suggest to the Dáil that they should pass this motion.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this debate on the last day I pointed out that this Bill proposes to amend the Constitution and that it does not state specifically that it amends it. Leaving that point I just want to put before the Dáil before this Bill goes to a vote that we are asked to vote a sum of money which amounted last year to over £200,000 and which amounts almost to the same thing this year, and that no one in the country has any definite information as to where that money is going.  They only know that a few members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and a judge appointed by the Cumann na nGaedhcal Government sat for a while and made up their minds that it was a good thing from their own point of view to give certain moneys to certain people throughout the country. We have pressed time and again for lists of names and addresses of the pensioners throughout the country and we have been refused <Col N="1823" /> these addresses.  A couple of years ago we asked for a list of addresses and names and we got lists of names with no addresses. The Minister made the excuse that it would entail a great deal of work in his Department to give us the addresses.  I think it entails very much more work in the Minister's Department to jumble up the lists which he gave us in the fashion in which they were jumbled up, than would have been entailed by giving us the lists and the addresses.  We got a long jumble of names from all over the country.  They were jumbled up.  They were neither in alphabetical order nor in counties, and we had to go to the trouble of compiling them from the counties and putting them into alphabetical order in order to make some effort to find out who were getting pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the people of the country have a right to know who are getting military service pensions, and the only way by which they will be able to know that is by the Department of Defence publishing lists containing the addresses of the different pensioners.  The Minister has made no case why those addresses should not be given.  I hope before this debate concludes that he will, at least, promise to publish a list with the addresses.  On the Second Reading in Committee Stage we examined this Bill very thoroughly.  It was shown definitely that a large number of the pensioners did not receive their pensions until 1927.  Some of those pensioners were located in the Co. Monaghan.  They did not receive their pensions until the two elections of 1927.  The Minister has given no reasonable explanation whatsoever as to why, if these men were entitled to their pensions, they did not get them until Mr. Blythe got into a tight corner in the Co. Monaghan. Deputy Ward asked questions about a few of the pensioners whom he located in Co. Monaghan.  The Minister gave no reasonable explanation as to why these men did not receive their pensions until 1927.  On the <Col N="1824" /> Committee Stage the Minister made some effort to gloss over the facts, but Deputy Ward's case is still there to be answered.  I think anyone reading Deputy Ward's speech and the speech of the Minister for Defence will see that the Minister for Defence failed to answer the case put up by Deputy Ward.  I hope Deputy Ward will point out to-day exactly the points which the Minister glossed over, and how futile was the case made by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some aspects of the procedure of the Board of Assessors in arriving at a decision in these cases of applications for pensions on which I would like some information from the Minister. The nature of that information will bear a close relationship to the necessity for maintaining the right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to examine the evidence on which claims to pensions have been successfully established.  It is rather a pity that the Minister could not approach this question with an unbiassed mind.  From his attitude to Deputies who are in a position during the debate on this Bill to give information about these cases one is driven to the conclusion that the Minister has definitely set out to maintain the position that pensions have not been awarded for other than military service.  A person in the position of the Minister for Defence, or indeed in any other Department, should not, I think, set out to maintain that black is white.  If available information is placed at his disposal he should, instead of becoming abusive towards the people who supply that information, rather welcome it, especially when it comes from members of the Opposition Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Military Service Pensions Act, passed in 1924, military service means active service in any rank.  Active service has not been further defined for the Board of Assessors as far as I am aware, and I gather from the Ministerial utterances during this debate that intelligence work in the I.R.A. constitutes active service within the <Col N="1825" /> meaning of the Act.  I would like to know from the Minister if any such instructions had been issued to the Board.  Deputy Duggan informed me in discussing the case for a claim that a man must have proved that he took part in ambushes in order to succeed in being awarded a military service pension.  I want to know if this is so, and, if it is not so, I want to know what does active service mean, by whom is it to be defined, how is it to be defined and if that definition is put before the Board of Assessors.  It is true, of course, that Deputy Duggan was trying to explain the reason why Thomas McCloy of Drumacoon was not awarded a pension when he told me that it was actually necessary to have shot people in order to qualify for the pension.  He may not have been aware at the time that this man had been certified by all the officers in his area as having taken part in all the I.R.A. activities in that part of the country.  The Deputy's intention may have been to deceive me and put me off for the time being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No. At this stage I think we are entitled to hear from the Minister his definition of active service and we would like to know if the Board of Assessors has been instructed to act on a certain definition in accordance with the obvious wording of the Act.  I would also <Col N="1826" /> like to know if secret service in the Free State Army is active service within the meaning of the Act.  If it is active service within the meaning of the Act, then the people who were not in the Free State Army so far as the ordinary public can judge &mdash;the people who are pensioned but who have not served in the Army&mdash; may have complied with the law. That might explain the number of cases that we have in County Monaghan where there are many people drawing pensions who were never in the Free State Army so far as the ordinary public are aware and who would not be entitled to a pension unless secret service is considered active service within the meaning of the Act.  If there have been pensions granted for secret service work the Minister might explain, because it would require explanation, why harmless people like the people in Monaghan should require so many secret service agents during the civil war.  It is well known that the only time they were active was during the general election.  These men were filled with drink, sent around in that condition full to the brim and armed to the teeth, and God help anybody who said boo to the Minister for Finance during the Parliamentary election.  That may be the service for which they are pensioned and I hope the Minister will give us a satisfactory explanation in that connection. If the Minister gives the explanations and definitions that I have asked for we will be in a better position to judge whether any possible defence can be made for awarding pensions in many cases that I am aware of.  Assuming secret service was a pensionable service in both wars, the Minister will still have something to explain in some of the cases that I have raised during this debate.  Going back to case 21 on the Order Paper of 30th June, 1928&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage we must confine ourselves to what is in the Bill.  Considering that we had the matter fully discussed on the Second and the Committee Stages I think we cannot now, on the Fifth Stage, again take individual cases.  The debate must now be of a general nature.  As I have said before on many occasions, we can never in the House establish what the facts are where there is a difference about the facts in a particular case.  Certainly on the Fifth Stage we must not go into individual cases.</P>

I am able to prove that he has contradicted the statements he made on the Second Stage and that his information is misleading to this House.  The House is liable, as a result of being misled by the Minister's statement, to allow this Bill to pass.  Am I not to be allowed to show up this thing to the House or am I to be closured?  If the Minister has made misleading or false statements to the House, I surely should be allowed to disprove them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not on the Fifth Stage deal with the question of individual cases of pensioners and all the facts or alleged facts concerning them.  That is what the Ceann Comhairle is ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill the Minister stated that certain cases of court-martial that I cited here had never taken place.  He declared that these courts-martial had never taken place.  He admitted he had detailed information, as a result of the representations or complaints that I made in this House, <Col N="1828" /> and that in several matters I had been of great assistance to him.  He had found that a certain case I mentioned here as having been court-martialled did exist; as a result of his inquiries he found that the particular man I alluded to had been court-martialled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a subsequent stage he denied another case that I had mentioned had been court-martialled.  The second case I had mentioned was a very notorious one.  It had received a considerable amount of public notice; the children in the streets knew all about it; it was a dirty case.  The Minister discovered that he could not maintain the position that there had not been a court-martial, that he had made himself rather ridiculous by taking up such an attitude so he discovered on the Committee Stage that the man he knew all about on the Second Reading&mdash;he had the file before him, and knew all about him, Deputy Ward had been of great assistance to him &mdash;he knew nothing at all about, and that it was another man he knew all about.  I think the obvious inconsistency speaks for itself.  It would be interesting if the truth were known, to know how some of these men got pensions.  In one particular district where they had applied for pensions time and again, coming on the June elections they put their heads together and decided that they would invite the Cumann na nGaedheal organiser and have a conference with him.  They decided that it would be a good time to press home their claims and be guaranteed their pensions. They worked at the June election for the Minister for Finance, the goods were not delivered, but they were not so green at the September election; they demanded a written guarantee this time, so that they would not be had again.  One of the people who secured a pension in that way was a man who was court-martialled and expelled from the Army.  The Minister knew all about him at one time&mdash;he had the file before him; Deputy Ward had been of great assistance to him&mdash;but he subsequently discovered it was <Col N="1829" /> necessary to replace that case by a still more notorious one.  The Minister complained of these things being sprung on him, that he had not adequate notice.  I suppose I should have given him a copy of my speech before I delivered it, in order that he might be in a position to reply. The Minister complained that he cannot carry everything round in his head.  He need not shift the blame on to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party if Providence has not been kind to him in arranging what he is to carry about in his head.</P>
    <P>The period of service upon which some of these pensions are alleged to be based does not altogether tally with the Minister's contribution here regarding some of these cases. For example, in one case that I raised where a man was court-martialled and expelled from the Army, the Minister informed the House that the man did not draw any pension during the period of his expulsion.  I find that this man was court-martialled and expelled in the autumn of 1921.  According to a reply given to me on the 30th June, 1928, I find the man was drawing his pension for the entire period from the 1st April, 1921, to the 30th June, 1922.  That is part of the period of service upon which the pension was based, and during three-quarters of that time the man was not a member of the Free State Army, and he was not a member of the Irish Republican Army.  At a later stage on the Third Reading the Minister stated, regarding this particular case, that the man was reinstated.  He suggested that I had misled the House by not informing it that the man had been reinstated. In reply to a question by Deputy Aiken, asking if he was reinstated before the attack on the Four Courts or after, the Minister replied that he was reinstated before the attack on the Four Courts.  We find that the reinstatement consisted of his being allowed to join the Free State Army on the 24th of September, 1922, some months after the attack on the Four Courts.  These are only examples of some of the inconsistencies that the Minister for <Col N="1830" /> Defence put before the House in the course of this debate.  Instead of being reinstated before the Four Courts were attacked, the man referred to was allowed to join the Free State Army some months afterwards, and apparently by joining the Free State Army his dirty past was wiped out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that certain of these pensioners in Co. Monaghan whose cases I have raised here are drawing their pensions because of intelligence work in the I.R.A. in pre-truce days, and that that explains why men could be engaged in whole-time employment, drawing full salaries and never absent from their work.  I want to tell the Minister that that is not so, and in substantiation of that statement the Minister can consult the Co. I.O. of the area, the Brigade I.O. of the area, and the Divisional I.O. of the area.  All these will testify that these people were not on active service in any of the wars, and that they were certainly not in the Intelligence Department.  Your ruling, on this stage of the Bill, sir, will considerably curtail discussion.</P>

I am sure the Minister will be relieved to find that all the various inaccuracies he has put before the House on the different stages, and the various different stories which he has told about these mysterious cases are not all going to be exposed.  There is another class of case on which the Minister was very eloquent. The Minister asked us to believe that once a man had been certified for a pension practically no power under the sun could deprive him of that pension.  I do not suppose it is necessary to quote his actual words.  I do not know if I would have leave to do so, but in any case lest they should be quoted, he will not seriously deny that that was the line he took.</P>

      <P>The 13/2/'30, col. 241, Volume 33, No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As far as I can make out, the Board of Assessors granted a pension on his first application on 1st January, 1927.  Once the Board had granted it the delay in giving the pension was only contingent upon the time necessary to make certain inquiries as to whether the man was ineligible for it by reason of having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  The man had the pension granted to him on the 7th January.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It took from January until May to make the necessary inquiries.  The pension was awarded in May; the first payment was made in June, and things went on with a rush.  The election was in June also.  In column 242, Vol. 33, No. 1, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That was the decision of the Board.  After that we had no power to alter it.  The man was certified as due for a pension in January.  The suggestion was that this man was violently hostile in April or May, and that the Government took action to buy his support by granting him a pension. The Deputy knows that unless the man was sentenced to a term of six months' imprisonment there was no power to withhold the pension from him after 7th January.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister knows that that is a somewhat misleading statement, and is not in accordance with the facts.  I think he must know that men could be victimised later on, and the fact that certificates were issued to them was not a guarantee that they were going to get pensions if they did not support Mr. Blythe in the following Parliamentary elections. In substantiation of that I would refer the Minister to reference number S.P. 8408:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's desire to satisfy the Minister, but I am not satisfied that the Deputy has said anything at all so far relevant to the Fifth Stage of this Bill.  He had seventeen minutes on cases, and he said he was sorry he was hampered by the ruling of the Chair.  He then strayed off into other matters dealing with the question of the Minister's payment of pensions.  If the Deputy will consult the Bill he will find that the Bill is not concerned at all with the Minister's paying of pensions; it is a question of the findings of the Board of Assessors with regard to certificates.</P>

      <P>I claim that my version of these cases is true of the general position regarding military service pensions as administered, and I claim that the case that I have made is in itself sufficiently strong to make it necessary that we should allow the Comptroller and Auditor-General to see the evidence.  If the Minister or the Executive Council is not satisfied that a case has been made against the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act, would the <Col N="1833" /> Minister undertake to have an inquiry on oath conducted into these cases and into other cases that we would put before him?  He tells us that he has the evidence of reliable Army officers and that that is sufficient for him.  I want to direct his attention to the fact that if perjured evidence in substantiation of a claim has been submitted by these officers, and if it were proved, as the result of any inquiry, that certain officers had supplied false or perjured evidence, those officers would be in a very serious position and would be liable to prosecution.  I suggest in such circumstances that verbal or written evidence submitted to the Minister in explanation of these cases is not evidence that could be relied upon, because these men's own personal liberty if you like is at stake.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attitude all through this thing appears to have been to defend the awards at all costs, and I think it is rather a pity that he should have become so bitter and touchy.  Perhaps we have been hard on him, but if so we are not making any apology for it; we were merely discharging what we consider to be a duty.  I think, a Chinn Comhairle. on account of the way in which you have more or less circumvented me in this debate that I will have to conclude.  I submit, in conclusion, that it would be an outrage to pass this Bill and to perpetuate the graft that has been practised under the Military Service Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>I deeply regret that Deputy Ward is so upset about this Bill and that he has taken the whole thing so much to heart.  I have known the Deputy both in this House and on Committees; I think he is irrepressible and that he will rebound and recover from his present distress.  But from what he has told us, I fear the House has got a very bad impression of the morality of the people of Monaghan.  I know that in Co. Wexford there has been none of the suggested embezzlements and perjury which the Deputy suggested was prevalent in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I think the Deputy will admit that pre-Truee military service was not public service but secret service.  I think that the Public Accounts Committee in their first Report were correct in saying that pre-Truee military service was closely analogous to secret service and therefore should be treated accordingly.  It just struck me that if this Bill were not passed and if the Comptroller and Auditor-General were entitled to see all the records of the secret military service of those persons who had also joined the National Army subsequent to the Truce, he would equally be entitled to examine the accounts, and particularly the stores accounts, of the Irish Republican Army.  By such an examination possibly many of the regrettable accidents which are occurring throughout the country might be avoided.</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken complained that in a list which I supplied no addresses were given, and he spoke of my unsatisfactory way of dealing with certain cases mentioned by Deputy Ward.  When Deputy Ward referred to certain cases by number he mentioned one case&mdash;I think it was late in the evening; my office was closed and I had not access to the papers&mdash;under a certain number.  The details he gave of that case were practically identical with those of a case that I remembered perfectly clearly having dealt with, and I said to him that that case had been dealt with and that certain changes had been made. He then came on to a consecutive number and proceeded to give similar details which were practically identical with the case he had <Col N="1835" /> just mentioned.  Then I realised that I would need to look up my book, so to speak, and I asked the Deputy if he would mind telling me if he had given these details on the occasion of his asking the question.  He gave the sort of answer one expects from him.  He did not answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The result was with regard to point No. 1 that I assumed from the information he gave that he was referring to the case of another man, and the first opportunity I got I told him that my remarks on that occasion referred to No. 2 case and not to No. 1.  He says now that I had to do that because No. 2 case was more injurious than No. 1.  He then went on to point out what he called inconsistency.  I said the man was not paid from 1928.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, may I refer the Minister to columns 2199 and 2200 of the Official Report of the 5th December where he dealt with this case No. 21.  I asked: &ldquo;Will the Minister state whether he is referring to No. 21 or another.&rdquo;  The Minister replied: &ldquo;No. 21 is the case &mdash;&mdash; I remember, one case.  I do not remember any other case.  I have the file here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had that one case.  I did not know it was 21 or 22.  The information the Deputy gave, if he will look the matter up, was practically identical in the two cases.  When he did refer to No. 21 I decided that was the case I had in mind.  When he came to 22 I found his details were practically identical. Then I realised that I did not know whether it was one or the other.  I looked up the matter at the earliest opportunity, and came to the Dáil and told the Deputy that the information I had given him about a certain case did not apply to No. 2, but to No. 1 case.  Speaking from memory, I think at a later stage I said that the information at my disposal was such as to lead me to believe that the court-martial referred to in No. 1 case had not actually taken place.  Later on this afternoon the Deputy referred to it, and <Col N="1836" /> said that I had stated that the man was not paid for the time during which he was dismissed from the Volunteers.  Actually he knows perfectly well on a certain day in 1928&mdash;I do not remember the date now&mdash;he made certain statements about one case.  He said that the man had been court-martialled and dismissed from the Volunteers.  I looked that matter up and got no further assistance from the Deputy. I got certain information which led to the man losing his pension in respect of the period during which he was dismissed.  The Deputy comes along afterwards and quotes from one thing, and says the man was paid during that time.  He knows perfectly well that I explained to him that the removal of the payment in respect of that period was a result of information I got after he asked his question.  That was made perfectly clear at the time, though he now tries to blur it.</P>

      <P>It was not a question. This occurred in the course of the debate.  &ldquo;The man is not being paid a pension for the period during which he was outside the Volunteers.&rdquo; I have shown here in the answer of the Minister to this question of the 13th June, 1928, that his pension was paid during the entire period from 1st April, 1920, to 30th June, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy interrupts me to say this, that in 1928 <Col N="1837" /> he asked a question and got information indicating that the man was accredited with service for a certain period that he should not get credit for.  At a later date, he raised the same thing and I said this man is not now getting payment for that period. He said there is a contradiction.  It is nothing of the sort.  When I got the information that the man had not given service during a certain period, without any further assistance from the Deputy, the man ceased to receive payment for that period.  I told the Deputy that.  He now seems to have a grievance that when we got information we acted upon it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken complains that no addresses are given.  I have had a number of cases brought up to me from Fianna Fáil.  At least, one case was brought up to me by Deputy Walsh.  He said he believed that a certain man was getting a pension to which he was not entitled.  I said to Deputy Walsh that I should be glad to have any information he had in the matter, as I have said to other Deputies, Fianna Fáil or otherwise. The difference between Deputy Walsh and Deputy Ward is that Deputy Walsh really wanted to save the public purse.  Deputy Ward merely wished&mdash;I do not know whether I will be allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Deputy who matters; it is the Chair. Deputy Ward wished to take up an attitude different from Deputy Walsh, Deputy Walsh came forward with the information which he got. He knows, I think, that we went into the matter as thoroughly as we could and I think he knows the result of it. Certain Deputies on the Opposite Benches periodically ask for lists of these men.  Deputy Aiken says how can we give any information when we do not know the men's addresses. We cannot actually identify them. Deputy Ward incidentally talks about getting information from Deputies <Col N="1838" /> who are in a position to put valuable information before the Minister.  Where is the valuable information? There is nothing to prevent Deputy Ward coming along if he really wants to get this matter done in accordance with the law or if he thinks there is anything wrong, if he is not merely anxious to injure men in their daily life for the reason that these men defended the State against anarchists who were out to destroy it.  If he is really anxious for the public purse and has a proper case he has as clear a method of doing it as Deputy Walsh.</P>
      <P>Instead of that, what does he do? Every time he gets up I give him all the information at my disposal.  If he has anything that will be useful to refute that, let him come forward and give it to me instead of trying to make speeches which have no other effect than to suggest that people who are probably only getting money to which they are duly and lawfully entitled are ordinarily dishonest people.  Deputy Walsh went about the thing in a perfectly straightforward and honest way.  He knows quite well how he was received.  The same thing applies to every Deputy, Fianna Fáil or otherwise, independent of what I may think of that individual Deputy.  There is nobody in this House more anxious than I am to get after anybody who is getting money to which he is not entitled.</P>

They want to get up here and throw out &mdash;I will not say a blackguardly suggestion. They have not the ordinary guts to come forward and prove it afterwards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked into every case, as the Deputy knows.  In the one case where I got additional evidence it resulted in a man having a certain portion of his pension taken away.  With regard to the other case about which Deputy Ward gets up he is not in as good a position to know about it as a man I know of.  He throws certain accusations across the House.  On the other hand, I get written statements from other people which can contradict them.  When I get sworn statements from Deputy Ward or from his henchmen that will justify me in reopening a case, I will proceed to ask the Board to come together again. Certainly I am not going to do it merely when certain people who have not a very exalted sense of decency throw epithets and accusations about and then do not run the risk of facing up to them.  When the Deputy faces up to things we will get after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy stated that there was no power to withdraw a pension.  He can, if he likes, say that, but it is <Col N="1840" /> not strictly correct.  I have not power to do anything unless I have further evidence.  If a man has a pension and I get further evidence which makes me think he should not get it, I will certainly do anything that lies in my power to get that case re-opened.  In the event of having further information certainly then steps should be taken in respect of the pension in question. Apart from that, I think I was roughly correct in saying that I had not power to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>This debate was most irrelevant, but I would suggest to any Deputy who feels he is in a position to lay bare the facts, showing clearly that a man is drawing a pension which he should not be drawing, if he is not merely anxious to injure the man without having himself to face up to the responsibility, <Col N="1842" /> that he should put such information in writing and come along with all the information that is required and I will look into the thing. If there is a prima facie case which would justify me in summoning the Board the matter will be re-opened. In certain of these cases I have certain information which I indicated on a previous occasion was directly contrary to the information suggested by the Deputy.  It came from a man whose service in the Volunteers was on a more important scale and less expensive than the Deputy's. On the face of it as between the two I think more value is to be placed on the work of certain officers whose identity I think I indicated clearly during the debate.  Any unprejudiced person will recognise that General Daniel Hogan had a more distinguished career in the Volunteers and was more in a position exactly to know what was taking place than Deputy Ward.  I do not want to say anything more about Deputy Ward.  I think the people of Monaghan know something about his pre-Truce record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Money Resolution, I object to <Col N="1845" /> money being spent upon Bills of this sort.  We have other matters which are of great importance to this country, such as housing, the unemployment problem, the town tenants question, etc., which could be dealt with, instead of having old maids' Bills of this sort sent to this House from the Seanad and wailing and weeping over little birds.  I object to the Money Resolution being passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if this Bill is to go to a Select Committee after the Money Resolution is dealt with? I understood it was a Private Member's Bill and not a Government Bill.  The answer you, sir, gave me on a former occasion was that this was a Private Member's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think I ever told the Deputy that it was a Private Member's Bill.  This is a Bill which was initiated in and passed by the Seanad and the Second Stage was moved in this House by a Minister in Government time; and an order was made accordingly that the Bill be considered in Committee. The Bill is down for consideration in Committee of the whole Dáil to-day. I have no recollection of telling the Deputy that it was a Private Member's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Ceann Comhairle if it was a Government measure and he said it was not a Government measure.  If it is not a Government measure, what is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle says a number of things from the Chair and he finds it impossible to remember them accurately when he is asked about them without notice.  The Deputy might, perhaps, cite the Official Reports to prove that the Ceann Comhairle said this was not a Government Bill.  I think the Ceann Comhairle declined to state whether it was a Government Bill or not.  If the Deputy consults the Official Reports, he will find that the Ceann Comhairle stated the facts without commenting on them: that the Bill came from the Seanad and that the Second Reading was moved by the Minister for Justice in <Col N="1846" /> this House in Government time.  The Ceann Comhairle, I think, did not go further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I pressed the Ceann Comhairle on the point and my impression is&mdash;I do not happen to have the Official Reports here, but if I have time while the discussion is going on I shall get them&mdash;that he said it was not a Government measure, but there was no reason why the Minister should not move a Bill which was not a Government measure.  If it is not a Government measure, what else can it be except a Private Member's Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That dilemma, if it is a dilemma, should have been put to the Ceann Comhairle when the Committee Stage was being ordered.  I am not at all accepting the Deputy's version of what happened.  The Ceann Comhairle works on particular principles, and I am sure in this case, that he stated the facts.  The facts, as I said before, are, that this is a Bill from the Seanad; that the Second Stage was moved by a Minister in this House in Government time, and it was ordered accordingly to go to a Committee of the whole Dáil.  When the Money Resolution has been passed. the Bill will be taken in Committee of the whole Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important, because the whole question of order arises on whether or not this should go to a Select Committee, or whether the order adopted is irregular or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I wish to say that the order made for consideration of the Bill in Committee of the whole Dáil was quite proper, without any regard to the Minister's statement&mdash; if he cares to make a statement&mdash; as to whether or not this is a Government Bill.  From the point of view of the Chair, what happened <Col N="1847" /> is that the Bill was sent to a Committee of the whole Dáil.  That question of order is quite clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I feel inclined to say is, if I may respectfully say so, that you, sir, have stated absolutely correctly what happened.  This is a Bill which came down from the Seanad and which I moved here in Government time, and since Deputy Little has a thirst for classification, I shall allow him to classify it in any way he pleases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can classify it in any way he likes in his own mind.  I may point out to Deputy Doyle that any sum of money which may be spent on this matter will be absolutely trifling&mdash;it may amount to nothing at all.  It can never amount to anything except the most trifling sum, which could not be of any great importance for carrying out the most excellent projects to which the Deputy says it might be applied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this motion should be opposed.  I think this Bill is wrongly conceived.  Something should be done to prevent the export of certain wild birds; there is no doubt about that, but this Bill deals with it in the wrong way.  The treatment of wild birds should be approached from the point of view of educating young people not to be cruel to wild birds.  That should be a matter for the national schools, and as for the question of trading in wild birds, that should be brought <Col N="1848" /> under control by having traders and bird fanciers subject to a system of registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking against the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy meet the point of order raised by Deputy Law that he is making a Second Reading speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought not to waste money on the matter at all. On this motion on the Order Paper I think we are entitled to discuss what we are going to spend the money on.  In discussing that we are bound to discuss the merits of the Bill, and if we do not discuss the merits of the Bill, I do not know what we are to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a nice point.  On the Money Resolution the Deputy is entitled to discuss the question of the expenses of the Bill but clearly the merits of the Bill arise for debate on Second Stage.  The House has already agreed to the principle of the Bill, and the details of the Bill will be discussed in Committee, according to the Order already made by the House.  The Deputy is confined now to discussing, as Deputy Doyle very briefly and relevantly did discuss, whether it is a proper thing to spend any money upon this matter at all, but not so as to bring us back to the Second Reading debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in discussing the question of the Money Resolution one must have an eye upon the amendments we have to deal with. In looking at these amendments I can find no amendment that adequately deals with the matters I am raising now.  Not only are there no amendments there of that kind, but no such amendments could possibly be introduced into the frame-work <Col N="1849" /> of the Bill as it stands.  Therefore I say it is not proper that this House should devote public moneys to this Bill.  I think I am perfectly entitled to point out the defects in the Bill at this stage before the Bill is amended, because if I were out of order in that this is the wrong time to take the Money Resolution, and it should be taken after the Committee Stage.  Otherwise looking to what is going to be done in the Amendment Stage, I believe I am entitled now to argue against the Money Resolution being taken, because the Bill is defective in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was prepared to give the Deputy a certain amount of latitude on this matter, and on this particular Bill, which is not a very contentious one, but if the Deputy puts such a clear point of order I must decide it on account of the precedent it creates.  The Deputy's complaint is: he objects to the Bill because there are no amendments down for Committee Stage which would make the Bill acceptable to him and, therefore, he must discuss the defects of the Bill now, which defects he contends will not be met by anything done in Committee. The Deputy could have made his objections to the principle of the Bill on the Second Stage, or he could have put down amendments to the Bill which would be taken at the Committee Stage, but he cannot, on the Money Resolution to any Bill, object to the Bill on principle, and indicate the defects in the Bill by way of omission.  That would be impossible. The Bill was introduced and read a Second Time and it can be discussed, section by section, in Committee. The Bill will be reported, and there will be a Fifth Stage. These are all opportunities for discussing the Bill, but the Money Resolution is another thing altogether. and it cannot be used as another stage for discussing the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, a Chinn Chomhairle, what we can discuss on the Money Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1850" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect various points of order put to the Ceann Comhairle in the House.  I think he will remember that this is the kind of question which the Ceann Comhairle does not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he can. I submit with all seriousness that a Money Resolution, as now dealt with by the Ceann Comhairle, is purely a formal matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you cannot discuss an amendment on it or discuss the principle of the Bill, and there is nothing else to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not within the ingenuity of the Deputy to find anything else to discuss, it is not for the Ceann Comhairle to suggest to him how he can carry on a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Chair is not dealing with this matter in the spirit of seriousness which it deserves. There is a serious question of procedure here.  I think it is obvious after this discussion that a Money Resolution is largely a formal matter on which you can raise neither a question of principle nor a question of detail on an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy searches the records of the House and the Official Debates he will find that there have been debates on a Money Resolution, but it is clearly intended that there should not be a debate on a Money Resolution which would be merely a repetition of the Second Reading debate. I am really very serious in this because, while the matter of the Bill is not of what you might call first importance, the question of order is of some importance.</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed that the Deputy <Col N="1855" /> has not given us some argument in favour of the reduction of the penalty.  I think in legislation of this kind, and I venture to say that most members will agree with me, one point of view is that the penalty should not be absurdly excessive, and the other point of view is that you must see if you pass the Bill that the penalties should not be so small that the Act will be simply laughed at, that it will pay a person to break the law and pay the fine.  It must be borne in mind also that magistrates do not, except in extreme cases indeed, inflict the maximum penalty. As the Bill stands, if a magistrate thinks that a fine of a shilling, sixpence, or a penny would be sufficient, he would be entitled to inflict such a fine.  I, therefore, think that one pound does not seem to be extraordinarily excessive as the maximum fine.  The fine might be left in the discretion of the magistrate.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the very fact that a person is prosecuted, even though he may be fined a small sum, is sufficiently serious. A shilling is quite enough especially in cases where young people are prosecuted.  It is more likely that they would be able to pay 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalty should be measured according to the damage or injury and the damage done in trapping a bird would be very little. It may be said that the penalty I suggest is small but the injury would be very little.  The Minister states that the District Justice will not inflict the maximum penalty except in extreme cases, but I have known instances in which District Justices imposed the full penalty and it was because the full penalty was imposed in these cases that my attention was called to this matter.  In reality there was no breach of the law at all.  It is quite possible that the full penalty may not be imposed but on Second Reading I commented on the fact that the penalty suggested in the Bill was £25 or three months in jail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The penalty in this case is 10/- but if a man is fined a shilling and costs in each case that should be sufficient to meet the offence. I think the Minister ought to meet me in this amendment.  As I stated on Second Reading where you have extreme penalties you are encouraging people to defeat the law and to do anything in order to accomplish that, even to go the length of committing perjury.  We have cases frequently before the District Justices in which perjury is committed. I think it would be better to have a small penalty in these cases and to have the law obeyed rather than to have a big penalty and to have the law disobeyed.  That is why I put down the amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>I entirely disagree with the views expressed by Deputy Nolan.  I think that if these small penalties were inserted in the Bill they would really make a farce of it. If children commit offences under the Bill their parents will pay the fines and if in these cases they have to pay a fine of ten shillings instead of a shilling, I expect that they will take good care that the children will not offend again.  It is up to the parents to make their children understand that they must obey the law and not destroy these birds wantonly.</P>

      <P>I think if there is any criticism that can justly be made as to the administration of the penal law in this country as regards offences against animals that criticism might well be that the penalty inflicted by the justices and the courts for such offences is invariably too light within the limits of their discretion.  They seem to me to err in inflicting too mild a penalty rather than in inflicting too severe a penalty.  The proposal in the Bill is a reasonable one.  The fine that may be imposed for a breach of the section is £1.  It shall not exceed £1. You must, when you have a court, <Col N="1857" /> allow that court discretion, and I do not think that it can be suggested that discretion has been exceeded by the courts inflicting too severe a penalty.  The tendency is to go the other way.  I agree with what Deputy O'Mahony says, that it is turning the Bill into a farce if this House is to alter this Bill fixing the maximum penalty at 1/-.  It is better not to pass the Bill at all than to pass the Bill with such a section as that, because if you put such a section into the Bill the country cannot be expected to take it seriously.  I would ask the House to reject this amendment.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with what the two Deputies who have last spoken have said.  If you have a Bill of this kind you must, in order to make it work, have a penalty that will meet the case.  This is not too severe a penalty, but putting the penalty at £1 leaves it in the discretion of the Justice to measure the fine by the particular offence that is committed.  I think anybody who follows the cases tried from time to time in the courts and notes the penalties that are inflicted for this kind of offence will agree that the penalties are, as a rule, too moderate.  Sometimes, in cases of cruelty, the penalties inflicted are very moderate; if I might say so, they are immoderately so&mdash;if I may use that word.  I do not think a Deputy will come across any case in which a District Justice or a Judge has passed a sentence that could be called at all severe.  You must have a reasonable penalty if the legislation passed by the House is to work. It is necessary to fix a reasonable maximum penalty or the whole thing will be a farce.  I hope the House will not alter the section as it stands. Except in very rare cases the maximum penalty will not be inflicted, and I hope these exceptional cases will never arise or that they will be very rare indeed.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Mahony said is absolutely ridiculous. He talked about children committing offences against this Bill, and said that their parents will have <Col N="1858" /> to pay the fines.  How does the Deputy think that working people in this country can pay the penalty in the Bill every time their children commit offences against it?  These are offences that they do not regard as offences at all.  It may seem a slight thing to Deputy Rice or to Deputy O'Mahony to pay a fine of 10/-, but 10/- does not seem a small thing at all to working people in the country.  Deputy Rice says that the District Justices err on the side of leniency.  I can, on the contrary, assert that the District Justice does not err on the side of leniency, and if I were permitted to quote examples of the opposite mentality on the part of Justices I could do so. Some of those District Justices take up fads, and on every occasion on which they have a chance they will inflict the maximum penalty for this sort of thing which is hardly regarded by the people as an offence at all.  I know that the people must be taught to regard cruelty to birds as wrong, but you cannot begin suddenly and make them pay these maximum penalties now.  I submit that Deputy Nolan's amendment is quite reasonable, and I urge the House to accept it.</P>

      <P>One aspect has been lost sight of.  If you make the maximum penalty very small you are encouraging the employment of children in this country.  Suppose you have at the moment a case where wild birds are being trapped by adults.  By this legislation you make it difficult for an adult to continue doing this, but if you insert a small penalty for a child you may find that the child will be drafted on to that sort of work.  That is what will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Ryan that in the first place this section is dealing simply with an offence committed during the close season, that is during the nesting, breeding and rearing-time.  That section appears to me to be rather a reasonable one, and if this offence is committed by a young person, no doubt that young person will be more lightly fined, <Col N="1859" /> if fined at all, than an adult.  And the young person may not be fined at all because you have the Probation of Offenders Act.  It is much more likely that a young person will be fined a very small sum than that the adult will be fined a very large sum.</P>
      <P>Surely Deputies can visualise cases in which there is an adult, a grown person, twenty-five or thirty years of age, going out during the breeding season, and for mere wantonness breaking any quantity of hatching eggs and cruelly ill-treating wild birds, taking fledglings out of their nest and flinging them about from mere wantonness.  There ought to be in any case like that a penalty much higher than 1/- inflicted.  I have received complaints from Deputy Ryan's own county in connection with an island which is well known as a breeding-place for wild birds.  In regard to that island there have been complaints about picnickers going out there and cruelly ill-treating wild birds.  I am sure these complaints have reached the Deputy and the county council where people in the most wanton fashion do this thing.  When they do, does not the Deputy think that in such exceptional cases there should be power to inflict a very strong penalty?  I think the Deputy is assuming that in every case the penalty that will be inflicted will be £1.  That is not how the thing will work out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What is cruel in the case of the poor is merely sport for those who are well-off.  This is a most odious Bill; everything in it is odious on account of that class prejudice which is apparent in it and which creates such hatred in the hearts of the ordinary poor workers in Ireland against the more privileged classes.</P>

I could quite understand what Deputy Ryan said and I do hope that the District Justices will not be so foolish as to impose <Col N="1861" /> fines altogether out of proportion to the circumstances of the case.  If a Justice does so he will place himself in an unenviable position. I visualise that in very many cases under this Act offenders will get off with a warning and the maximum penalty will only be imposed in the most flagrant cases.  I imagine if the fine is large enough that there could be an appeal; in any case there would be an outery against flagrant sentences and this outery would be such as to make a District Justice reconsider his ways.  I agree with the speakers who say that if you place small penalties in the Bill you are simply making it nugatory from the beginning.</P>

What is the Bill doing but turning the Dáil into a farce?  Deputy Beckett says that this thing would encourage employment of children.  It will, in destroying birds' nests, and they would be hard up for employment if that is the only occupation they can follow.  I can understand Deputy Rice encouraging appeals, because that will benefit the legal profession.  If you have a fine of one shilling it is enough. If the same mentality exists amongst the District Justices as exists amongst the people who drafted this Bill and if they impose the maximum penalty for robbing a bird's nest, I wonder what would they fine a per son for robbing a mare's nest?  I will not press this amendment to a division if the Minister will accept Deputy Ryan's amendment.</P>

    <P>This brings us to practically the same argument as we have just listened to, except that 10/- is in as the fine which is considered sufficient. The effect of my amendment would be that under the Bill 10/- could be applied to cover all birds.  I think 10/- would be sufficient for the whole lot.  I would not have introduced the amendment at all only I know that on certain points District Justices have not got judicial minds. They run away with certain ideas, and every chance they get they inflict the maximum penalty.  It is quite possible there would be one or two, or perhaps more, District Justices in the country who are as enthusiastic about this Bill as the people who framed it, and they will not be content unless they impose the maximum penalty.  If a young person, through wantonness or innocence or by mistake, were to interfere with a nest of young birds, and if the parents were to be fined 10/- for every bird it would be a great hardship. We should not give power to a District Justice to inflict such a heavy penalty.</P>

Certainly, if there are cases of maximum fines they are a very small number indeed, and I may say, on the whole, the District Justices fine very lightly.  They do fine heavily in poteen cases, but no District Justice sitting to hear a case under this Bill would impose a maximum penalty unless it were a very extreme case.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that this is only for a second offence.  The Deputy will note in line 9:</P>
      <P>If and so far as the offence was committed in respect of wild birds not mentioned in the first schedule to this Act, be liable in the case of a first offence to be reprimanded and discharged on payment of costs and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a penalty not exceeding 10/- for every such wild bird...</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister may by <Col N="1866" /> order made on the application of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries permit, for the purpose of protecting fisheries, the taking alive or the killing or both the taking alive and the killing in any particular fishery district or any particular part or parts thereof of any particular kind of wild birds in every year or any particular years or year during the whole or any particular part of the period which is by virtue of this Act or an order made under this Act the close time for that kind of wild birds in such fishery district or such particular part or parts thereof and may by any subsequent order made on the like application revoke or amend any such first-mentioned order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to enable the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, for the purpose of protecting fisheries, to make orders for the destruction of birds that do serious harm to fish.  Of course the fishing industry is a very valuable one and there are certain birds that are, I understand, very pernicious, and that destroy enormous quantities of young fish.  It seems that these birds should not be protected.</P>

That would enable the present birdcatchers to use nets for the purpose of catching birds and to use a decoy for netting.  That can be humanely done, and it would enable the birdcatchers to carry on their present occupation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who handle birdlime, what I might call the professionals in this business, do not cause any undue hardship in any way, nor do they ever resort to places where there are birds of a sort that are not of very much use to them, and consequently they would not injure any of these birds.  If you prevent people from attempting to catch birds by birdlime you will prevent people from earning a living.  That is no exaggeration.  There are a number of people in the country and <Col N="1870" /> in the City of Dublin who are eking out an existence by catching birds, and you propose to deprive them of that means of living.  God knows, we have enough people eking out the means of existence, and I think that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also put my name to this amendment.  The way I look at it is that there are certain people who earn a living by catching birds, whether for sale at home or for export, and if we are going to inflict even the smallest amount of human suffering by depriving those people of a living I think we should not pass a Bill like this, considering that in the present state of the country no alternative employment can be given to these people.  We should not have so much regard for the sufferings of birds in that way as we should have for people who are not getting enough to eat, and if we are going to throw more people into the unemployed ranks by passing a clause like this, I think we are making a great mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have observed on many occasions professional birdcatchers catching birds with birdlime and I never saw any cruelty.  They may have been expert men at their work.  They generally go behind some fence or behind a haycock, because it is at that time of the year that birds are mostly caught, and the birdlime is put on close to where they are hiding. When a bird sticks to the bird-lime it is taken away and treated with the greatest kindness, much more kindly than I have seen sportsmen treating game with their dogs and guns.  I have been told that birdlime in some cases is a cruel way of catching birds, because the bird-lime is made of a material that should not be used.  If it were possible for the Minister on the Report Stage to bring in an amendment forbidding the use of certain materials in birdlime I think it would be more to the point, but I certainly would not agree to this provision remaining in the Bill unless it can be shown to me that alternative methods of catching birds are quite as effective, so <Col N="1871" /> that we will not be depriving men of earning their living.  They have been described as the lowest of the low.  I do not know that they are.  As far as I can see they are earning as honest a living as many other persons, and they should be allowed to earn it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I seriously hope that the House will reject this amendment.  I do not want to repeat the remarks I made on the Second Reading with regard to birdlime, but it is a well-known fact that the use of birdlime does result in cruelty to birds.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that professional birdcatchers are much more careful and much more humane than the amateurs in the use of it.  But no amount of care can prevent a bird from escaping at times, even with professional birdcatchers.  That bird succeeds in getting away before it is taken off the twig, and when it alights on another tree or bush it dies of starvation.  I am sure that Deputy Ryan himself must have seen instances where birds escaped and were afterwards found dead on bushes or lying on a road, with lime on their wings.</P>
      <P>I read in the Press a letter written by an eye-witness, and I propose to read part of it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the public knew and realised the hideous cruelty of bird-lime, they could not be so callous as not to insist on the passing of Senator Brown's Bill.  Let me cite a bitter experience of only a week ago.</P>
      <P>Just near here on the Curragh, I saw a dog playing the game, as dogs do, of chasing a bird on the wing.  It is only a game, for they never catch a healthy bird.  But I saw that this little bird was flying very low in zig-zag jerks, so I shouted at the dog just as he knocked it over, and, hearing me, made off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ran and picked up the little dead thing&mdash;the most pitiful I have ever held in my hand.  It was a robin, but just a skeleton in feathers&mdash;and such feathers&mdash; bent, twisted, clotted with lime, its wings glued so that it could <Col N="1872" /> not fly.  But the most terrible were the eyes&mdash;closed, enormously swollen, seared and blinded with lime.  It was dying of thirst and starvation, blind, crippled and despairingly struggling when the dog's paw mercifully ended its agony.</P>
    <P>Why is all this suffering inflicted? To sell the few that survive the trapping to English traders who are not allowed to buy English birds.  Some while ago a casual labourer for whom we used to send when extra labour was needed, refused to come, saying he made more in one day's trapping of goldfinches from a Manchester dealer, who had a big foreign contract, than he could earn in a week's ordinary work.</P>
    <P>Now, when these things can happen, whether they are the result of the operation of amateurs or professionals, I think the House ought not to be impressed by the argument that some persons may lose their employment.  There are other ways of taking birds than this inhuman means of birdlime.  The use of bird-lime has been prohibited in other countries, and I suggest that if this country is not to hold itself up as one which has no regard for the sufferings of dumb creatures that the House ought to reject this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dr. Ryan has said, I think, a lot of this thing is due to the use of an inferior kind of birdlime.  I think that bird-lime used years ago did not cause the suffering indicated by Deputy Rice.  These cases have occurred.  I have heard of them also occurring. The birds were unable to rise afterwards as a result of the birdlime. When the older form of birdlime was used the birds were able to rid themselves of it.  I think the matter would be arranged if the older form of birdlime could be used, because undoubtedly a very large number of men are earning more or less a precarious livelihood at this in the country, and if we are going to deprive them of it we may spare the sufferings of the birds, but we will inflict suffering on human beings. <Col N="1873" /> One would be worse than the other. There are men in the country who are not professional bird-catchers. They catch birds on Sunday, and they take an interest in the work. They are often more kind to the birds than the people who criticise them, because it is to these men's interests that the birds when captured should be well looked after.  While I admit that the birds who escape suffer, the birds that are caught are tended very carefully, and it is seen that no trace of birdlime remains on them.  There is a way out of the difficulty by insisting on the older form of birdlime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. George Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, there are other ways of catching birds for those who are making a trade of it.  There is netting and other ways.  I think we should not be behind other nations in doing away with a system which lays itself open to the charge that it cannot always be done without very gross cases of cruelty, such as the instance Deputy Rice mentioned just now.  Of course, in the hands of expert people it might not be so bad. Even with them great suffering may be caused, but in the case of inexpert people untold suffering might be caused, and I think we have no right to run any risks of that kind. We are bound to protect the creatures under our control in every way from suffering.  Certainly birdlime is not a thing that commends itself to me, or to anybody that has much to do with animals or any regard for them.  We are not the only country in the world that has forbidden the use of birdlime, and I hope we will not be backward in putting an end to its use when other ways of trapping birds are available which are quite sufficient to meet the case of those who go in for trafficking in birds.</P>

      <P>Certainly anyone who is out capturing birds does not want to inflict hardship on them.  Birdlime might be a bit severe.  We have it from the professional bird-catcher, Deputy Rice, and it must be.  Has anyone seen a hare die in a form after a long course?  There is nothing about that.  I have seen hares die in their forms.  Has anyone caught a bird that has been winged by a sportsman who has a game licence?  He fires and wounds the bird and it dies.  Which is the greater punishment to put birdlime on a stick and catch a bird, to wound a bird on the wing, or to hunt a hare to the extent that it dies in the form?  I have a great deal of sympathy with the wording in the Bill, and I think something should be done to meet the case.</P>

      <P>I think this section is a very important one in the Bill, and that the real point about birdlime is that if every bird that had alighted on the birdlime was a bird that the professional catcher wished to keep he would clean it. Any bird he does not wish to keep he cleanses and lets go.  If that was always done there would be no cruelty in birdlime but the real point is that birds get on the birdlime and get away and that is a terribly cruel game.  They die and they transmit the birdlime to other birds by alighting on hedges and twigs.  Other birds get on and they die.  The minutest bit will seal their bills and they will die of starvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion with more than usual interest because, frankly, it is a subject upon which I myself have no personal knowledge.  In my part of the country I think there is very little catching of wild birds at all.  I brought to this discussion a completely open mind.  It did appear to me, however, that a strong case has been made out against birdlime and it does appear to me that no really strong case has been made out in favour of its use.  It has been stated that the prohibition of the use of birdlime would put a large number of persons out of employment. Why that should follow has not been made anyway clear.  I heard it stated here, and it appears to me to be sound, that an expert bird-catcher can more humanely and more efficiently catch birds by means of the decoy and the net than he could by means of birdlime.  The decoy and the net are perfectly harmless and inflict no cruelty, and if there is a humane method of catching birds which is even more efficient than the one which is not humane then surely it is no hardship upon anybody to prohibit the one and to leave the other open.  That is to say, to prohibit birdlime and leave the netting open, as it is left open under this Bill.  That there is a class of bird which can be caught by birdlime and not be caught by net is an argument that has not even been advanced and, therefore, I cannot see any reason why this method of birdliming should be continued.  It is admitted by the advocates of birdlime that there is a form of birdlime which should not be used, which is a form of birdlime which inflicts very unnecessary suffering, but that is the birdlime which we are told is now in constant use. That appears, to my mind, to refute any argument which has been put forward, because in one breath the advocates of birdlime say that birdlime <Col N="1876" /> users are all persons who are anxious not to inflict suffering and who do everything that lies in their power to prevent birds from suffering, and in the very next breath they tell us they are using a form of birdlime which is cruel, when they could use a form of birdlime which is not cruel.  The one argument seems altogether overwhelmingly to answer the other.  Of course, it is for the House to decide, but I, personally, will vote that the words stand.</P>

      <P>The Minister misunderstood what the advocates of birdlime have said.  The advocates of birdlime did not say that those who used birdlime are liable to use an objectionable form of birdlime. What I meant to say and what I did say was that the professional bird-catcher used a form of birdlime that did not inflict any pain on the bird and that was not followed by any ill effects, but that others may have used a form of birdlime that the same could not be said for.  In my experience, I never saw the other form of birdlime.  I said if it could be proved to me that an alternative method of catching birds was as effective for those engaged in this occupation I would be satisfied, but I am afraid no very convincing case has been made that catching birds by nets is as effective as catching them by birdlime.  I certainly am not satisfied with the arguments that have been put up against the amendment.</P>

      <P>I personally think that the penalties in Section 4 are unduly high&mdash;that is to say, for an offence under that section a person should be liable on summary conviction to a penalty <Col N="1878" /> not exceeding £25, or alternatively, or in addition thereto, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding three months.  I suggest to the House the amendment in my name.  I think fourteen days' imprisonment and five pounds fine would be ample and would suit the circumstances of the case.  If amendment 13 is agreed to, I take it amendment 12 would not be moved.</P>

      <P>Of course, in a first offence it lies in the discretion of the District Justice as to whether he will punish or not.  He can always use the Probation of Offenders Act.  Of course, even in a first offence there may be a considerable case of cruelty.  There is one thing that I myself would like to see put down very much, and that is the catching of birds with hooks.  I think that is a very unpleasant form of amusement, and I should like to put it down.</P>

    <P>Every person who shall export, or attempt to export, or cause to be exported or attempted to be exported, from Saorstát Eireann for the purpose of sale any live wild bird of any of the kinds of wild birds specified in the Second Schedule to this Act shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence to a penalty not exceeding ten shillings for each bird in respect of which the offence was committed and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a penalty not exceeding two pounds <Col N="1879" /> for each bird in respect of which the offence was committed or alternatively or in addition to such last-mentioned penalty to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In line 45 after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;between the 15th day of March and the 1st day of November, both days inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what the real objection of the framers of this Bill was to the export of wild birds.  I heard certain Deputies express the view that we should preserve wild birds, such as goldfinches, linnets, etc., in order to beautify the country. I do not know if that is the object. When putting down this amendment, however, I thought the object was to prevent cruelty during export, because I believe, a large number of goldfinches die on the voyage across. I have been told by experts in this business that these birds usually die because they are very young and are suddenly put on a diet of hard grain, such as bird seed, for which they are not able.  I am told that when the birds reach a certain age they can be safely put on this diet of bird seed and are able to stand the journey across.  If export was forbidden between the 15th March and 1st November there would be no hardship inflicted.  By 1st November the birds would have reached a certain age and would be able for the journey. I think the reason for putting in the section was to prevent this cruelty.  If the framers of the Bill or Deputies have other objects in view, for instance, that these birds should be preserved here as they are an attraction and an asset to the country, of course this amendment does not meet their point.  Still, I believe that if men are earning a livelihood from this, and we prevent them from earning that livelihood by stopping the exports, we will be committing a hardship on human beings, and we ought to be more particular about human suffering than about the suffering of birds.</P>

      <P>This only applies to a certain class of birds mentioned in the second schedule.  I understand the general view of the country is that this particular type of bird is in danger of becoming extinct, and that they would be, not merely from the point of view of the amenities of country life, but also from the point of view of utility, a considerable loss.  A great number of these birds perform a very useful function in destroying insects.  Of course, we will have to discuss the actual birds to be safeguarded when we come to the second schedule, but it is a pity that some of our native wild birds should be completely exterminated by export, and I ask the House to let the Bill stand as it is.</P>

      <P>I was recently reading an account of the Manchester public parks which are being enlarged for the benefit of poor people to a very much greater extent than in any other district in England or Ireland.  In this report special attention was given to the question of wild birds, and it was deplored that almost all the wild birds had become extinct.  It is difficult to say how they can possibly be reinstated. It is very important that we should look ahead before a similar thing happens here, and preserve the wild birds which are an attraction to our countryside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Ryan's amendment, I fail to see how Deputies can show that certain birds are extinct because of so many being caught and exported.  Take the case of the wren, which is supposed to be the king of all birds.  That bird breeds twice in the year and brings out clutches of from 15 to 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The wren is not mentioned in this Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but why is it not mentioned?  There is hardly as scarce a bird to-day as the wren, in spite of the large clutches that it brings out twice a year.  The bullfinch also breeds twice a year, and yet it is a very scarce bird, but nobody argues that it is because so <Col N="1881" /> many of these birds are exported that they are so scarce.  It is an entire fallacy.  It is simply for the sake of making a case because somebody said somewhere that these birds were getting extinct.  Take my own county.  There is one bird mentioned in the second schedule to the Bill which will not be allowed to be exported that I never saw in my life.  Some of the oldest professional bird-catchers live near me, and they never caught one of those birds in their lives, and yet we are assured that they are becoming extinct as a consequence of the bird-catchers.</P>
      <P>Is not the robin a scarce bird?  It is a very scarce bird, and I should like to hear from some of the experts why it is scarce.  I know the reason, but it is not because of the bird-catchers.  More goldfinches died during the snow twelve months ago from starvation and hunger than the bird-catchers could do away with in ten years; yet there are fanatics in this country, men and women, weeping and wailing and getting this Chamber turned into a vapour bath about the little birds, who did nothing to save them from starvation during the snow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill some Deputy, whether it was Deputy Doyle or not I do not know, but someone of the same mentality, <Col N="1882" /> discovered that the scarcity of goldfinches was due to the iniquities of the Minister for Agriculture because he had destroyed thistles throughout the country, and that because of that he was to blame for the scarcity of goldfinches.  I am glad now that Deputy Doyle thinks that it was owing to the big snow a year ago that the scarcity is due. Undoubtedly the goldfinch, which is one of the most beautiful birds in this country, has become and is becoming rarer than it was before. Twenty or thirty years ago the price of the goldfinch was 6d. and 1/-, whereas at the present time they are sold for from 8/- to 10/- each, and the reason is because of the wholesale export of these birds to England at the present time.  We can consider at a later stage what birds ought to be included, and whether all the birds in the Second Schedule should be kept in it or not, but if this is not passed the goldfinch will disappear altogether from among the birds of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a very bad principle which is creeping into legislation in this country.  In the Game Preservation Bill a section was inserted whereby the holder of a £2 licence could hold up anybody he suspected of committing an offence under the Act, and ask him for his name, address and licence. Now you introduce a principle by which anybody can stop another person, accuse him of committing an offence under this Act and get his name and address, and if such person does not give his name and address he is liable to a penalty.  That is a very serious matter.  If a person has a private spite against another he can hold him up, accuse him of robbing a bird's nest, or something like that, get his name and address, and, in fact, ask him all sorts of vexatious questions and cause any amount of trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As previously pointed out, there are people in this country who are a little bit over-enthusiastic about cruelty to wild birds and animals, perhaps much more so than they are to the obvious cruelty directed against human beings.  We received circulars and letters from all sorts of people, as Deputy Doyle said from cranky old maids, asking us to give our support to the Bill. If you are going to allow these people to go around the country holding up boys and men, who may be out, perhaps, only for a picnic or who may be merely picking flowers in the hedges, and allow them to demand their names and addresses and ask them whether they have been inflicting cruelty on wild birds, you will make it impossible for anyone to live in the country. It is hard enough for anyone to live in it at present, but this section, if allowed to stand, will make <Col N="1886" /> it much harder.  If you have Bills like this passed into law you cannot go anywhere without being liable to be asked your business by people who have a fad in that direction.  I do not see any necessity for the section and I think that the Minister should remove it in the interests of law and order.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the word &ldquo;heron.&rdquo; I understand that the heron is an epicure and that it feeds on salmon fry, so when it comes to a question of protecting the heron or protecting salmon fry, I would ask the Committee to say that the balance of advantage lies in the protection of salmon fry.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I gave the reasons why I thought the word &ldquo;heron&rdquo; should be taken out of the first schedule.  The only point I would like to add now is that I have a heronry of my own and I know the damage they have done to my property.  Perhaps it is just as well for my own peace of mind that I do not know the damage they have done in the surrounding districts.  There is no question that herons do untold damage to fisheries and I think a wise restriction should be made with regard to how many herons we are going to allow loose in the country. After all, the fishing industry has become one of our most valuable assets.  Every year it has increased in value and I think everything should be done to protect it.  That is why I consider the word &ldquo;heron&rdquo; should be taken out of the first schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat surprising that the promoters of the Bill include &ldquo;heron&rdquo; in the schedule because as has been pointed out by Deputy Murphy, the heron undoubtedly does considerable damage amongst salmon and trout during the spawning season.  It is not an uncommon experience for anglers when they catch trout to find that the trout bears marks made on it by the heron.  The method of the heron is to combine patience with the perfect camouflage of its grey colour.  The usual procedure is that he waits on the bank of a stream <Col N="1891" /> until such time as an unsuspecting fish comes within reach.  Immediately his murderous beak flashes out and the unsuspecting fish becomes a victim.  It is also well-known that the heron will wait for hours on the bank of a river.  It will even follow up spawning fish and wait until such time as the female fish drops the spawn which it will then eat up.  I can assure the House that it does considerable damage as far as trout and salmon are concerned and I hope the Minister, in view of these indisputable facts, will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consulted certain naturalists, especially one well-known naturalist, possibly the best known naturalist in this country, about various classes of birds, because while there are some birds that we all know, there are various other birds that we do not know; even by name we have not an acquaintance with them, much less do we know their appearance. <Col N="1892" /> I have here information that certainly some birds in the First Schedule should be deleted, and also that some should be deleted from the Second Schedule.  The principal one in the Second Schedule is the bullfinch.  That appears to be a very pernicious bird, but he is one of the most beautiful of our small birds. His piping is very pleasant, but the damage which he does in our gardens is very considerable, and there seems to be an agreement on that matter.  I would like to have the bullfinch taken out of the Second Schedule.  I am also told that amongst the tit there is a bird called the great tit that does a great deal of damage and kills a considerable number of the smaller birds.  This bird also does considerable damage to bee-keepers.  He robs the bee-hives and kills the bees on the wing and generally makes himself most objectionable. I would therefore like the permission of the House to bring in some amendments on the Report Stage, when I will have further information at my disposal.  I suggest to the House the deletion of two or three birds that are mentioned in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Before the First Schedule is put I want to say that the bullfinch has been mentioned as a very destructive bird.  I am aware that it does a good deal of injury in gardens.  For instance, it eats the buds of the currant bushes and it is especially troublesome in the garden. But it is a most beautiful bird.  It brings colour and brightness to every place.  I would much prefer to see currants destroyed than to see the bullfinch go.  But it is very easy to net your currants.  Everyone who has a garden and who is wise puts nets over his currants.  In that way the bullfinch can be quite easily kept from the bushes.  These birds are really a very great asset.  They add brightness and beauty to the countryside.  I am aware that they do damage in our gardens.  I do not deny that for a moment, but it would be a pity to see them wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment 29&mdash;to delete the words &ldquo;bullfinch, goldfinch, linnet.&rdquo;  As Deputy Wolfe has stated, the bullfinch is a most injurious bird about trees.  The Deputy admits that he would prefer to see all his currants destroyed sooner than that these beautiful birds would pass away. The people who have no gardens but who make a living out of these birds are very much concerned about the principle of this amendment and about these birds being deleted out of this Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> The case is put up that the bullfinch is getting scarce.  That is not because of the number of them that are exported out of the country.  Of all the birds exported there are probably less bullfinches exported than any other class.  If the Minister could give us some information as to the number of bullfinches that have been exported in one, two or three years we would be coming down to some definite facts as regards the bullfinches.  There are numbers of people who earn a livelihood out of these birds and we ought not to take from them their means of living.  I ask the House to accept the amendment and that is not asking too much.  I know the case will be put up that the little birds are scarce because of exportation.  If this amendment is accepted it will give the people an opportunity to eke out an existence.  Little children with souls are of more importance than the little birds that Deputy Wolfe and other people like him are crying out about.  Something ought to be done to enable people to look after their little children until the time arrives when full employment can be given to everybody in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a rather awkward position as far as this amendment is concerned because I would be prepared to vote for Deputy Doyle's amendment in so far as it deletes the word &ldquo;bullfinch,&rdquo; but I would not support it if it includes goldfinch and linnets.  As the amendment stands I would have to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>My view in this matter is the same as the Minister's.  I would willingly exclude the bullfinch from the protection of the Bill but I would be inclined to draw the line at the goldfinch and the linnet. We hear a lot of talk about the preservation of birds, especially small birds.  Attributing the scarcity of small birds to the work of the bird catchers is altogether wrong. Nature is the main cause of the scarcity of the small birds.  If we have prolonged frosts lasting over three <Col N="1895" /> weeks, with a little snow, we find the larger birds preying on the smaller. The greatest offender is the common rook, known as the crow.  Go out at the end of a fortnight's frost into any field and you will see around the fences heaps of feathers, all that are left of the little birds.  The greatest offenders are the rooks, and they are large in numbers.  Then we have the magpies, the bawks and other birds continually preying on the little ones that are too weak to get away.  If you want to preserve the little birds you must make war on the undesirable birds that prey upon them. There is no doubt that the goldfinches have disappeared in large numbers.  I am inclined to give this Bill a chance, and I am inclined to protect the goldfinches, at least for a period.  The bullfinch does more harm to more than black currants. These birds do damage to all the buds of fruit trees, and they often pluck the buds.  Although the birds have not been protected up to this there are still quite enough of them in the country.  By not giving them the protection of this Bill you will still have the same number of birds. Deputy Wolfe will be likely to see an odd one now and again to charm his heart with its gay colour.  Deputy Doyle would be well advised to leave out the goldfinch and the linnet and then the House will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy <Col N="1896" /> Gorey that the frost does more damage to the little birds than any other method of destruction.  They die with the hunger; they have often died of hunger during frosty periods and no one came to the rescue, no one came to feed the little birds we hear so much about now.  That is one reason why the birds are getting so scarce.  One hard winter does away with more birds than all the bird-catchers would catch in twenty years.  The rooks, magpies and hawks destroy little birds that are too weak to resist them.  I would like the common sense of Deputies to prevail, and I ask them to support this amendment.  There is too much wailing and weeping about the little birds, and the time of the House is being taken up unnecessarily. Deputies could be better employed discussing unemployment, housing or other works of importance to the nation than merely trotting out points about wild birds.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;Quail&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Quail is a game bird and comes under the Game Preservation Bill. Therefore it does not properly find a place in the Second Schedule to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;Siskin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think the case can be made that this bird has become extinct because of exportation or of bird-catching.  I stated on a previous amendment that never in my life have I ever seen a siskin in my locality.  That had also been the experience of people much older than me.  The scarcity of these birds cannot be attributed to the fact that they are being caught and exported.  People in other parts of Ireland have also told me that they have never seen a siskin.  Why this bird should be put in the schedule as one that people will not be allowed to export surprises me.  I think this bird ought not to be included in the schedule. I am of opinion that people should be at liberty to export them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy has made any case that the siskin is a pernicious <Col N="1899" /> bird.  I fancy that the Deputy knows nothing at all about the habits of the siskin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>And, therefore, the Deputy does not suggest that this poor siskin is in any way a harmful or a pernicious bird. If the siskin is almost extinct, as the Deputy says he is, and if he is a bird that does no harm, why not prohibit its exportation?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I never saw a siskin. Since the Deputy is so anxious that the bird should be driven out of the country, I presume he knows all about its habits.  I frankly confess that I do not.  The Deputy says that the siskin should be eliminated from the schedule.  Frankly, I know nothing about its habits.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Little would take the trouble of going over to the museum he would see on exhibit examples of Irish birds that are only to be seen in counties like Wicklow and Galway.  People living in the inland counties cannot be blamed for not having seen such birds.  There are birds to be found in the county Wicklow that one never sees in the inland counties.  There are birds there that you never see in the midlands. There are birds, too, in the north of Ireland that we never heard of.</P>

      <P>My point was that it was not merely a question of birds that we had not seen but of birds that we do not know anything about. The only Deputy who was able to throw any light on the subject was Deputy Gorey, and he has admitted that he never saw a siskin.  The <Col N="1901" /> only reason that I intervened in this debate was because I feel very acutely the humiliation of wasting public time upon this measure when we were cut short, in the most atrocious way last week, on the Local Government Bill.

      <P>In page 2, section 2 (1), 33 to 39, to delete all words after the words &ldquo;child&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section, and substitute the words &ldquo;the Justice of the District Court in the District in which such mother resides may issue a summons or other process requiring the person (in this Act referred to as the alleged father) identified in such information as the father of such child to appear on the hearing of an application by such mother or such local body (as the case may be) for an order (in this Act called an affiliation order) in respect of such child</P>
      <P>The principle embodied in this amendment was fully discussed in the House and met with agreement. I undertook to bring in the amendment in consequence of the agreement expressed.  It changes what was originally in the Bill, that the putative father should show cause why an order should not be made against him, which was rather an objectionable form.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which I agreed to accept from Deputy Little, enables a District Justice to order that the money to be paid in support of an illegitimate child should be payable not only to the clerk of a particular District Court but to the clerk of any District Court as might be convenient. With reference to an amendment moved by Deputy Fahy. I mentioned that I would consider whether there was any necessity for introducing it on the Report Stage. I went into the matter carefully, and I am advised by the Parliamentary draftsman that what Deputy Fahy was afraid of, that the mother might die and there would be nobody to receive the payments which had been ordered to be paid to the mother, and there would be nobody to make application to the District Court, has been already provided for, and any person who had custody of the child could make application to the District Court.  Therefore, the fears of Deputy Fahy are already met in the Bill and the principle he wished to have embodied in it is already there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little put forward an amendment dealing with that, and it was left to a free vote of the House.  I considered that if I brought in an amendment on the Report Stage in any way altering that amendment it would be going back not on an openly expressed but commonly felt <Col N="1903" /> opinion.  When a question is left to the House to decide upon, not only in principle but in form, it would not be fair for me to come forward and endeavour to get behind it in any way when it was left to the unfettered judgment of the House to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOReilly" hpid="Mr. T. O'Reilly Mr. T. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House again to Section 2 of the Bill, which deals with the means of claimants to the old age pension.  It proposes to repeal paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911. This paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>In calculating the means of a person for the purpose of this Act account shall be taken of the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate the hardships inflicted by this section on old age pensioners, I will mention the case of a man who lived in that part of the country that I come from.  This man owned a little holding on the side of a mountain and had the grass of six Kerry cows.  His wife died and he ran into debt to the extent of £180 or so.  The family went out to service.  The eldest daughter had been away in service for ten years before this period I am speaking of. He decided to go to America and sold the land to the daughter who had been in service at the time, for £200.  He was to get £20 to take him to America, and the daughter contracted to pay the whole debt. After seven years he came home, having been then 69 years of age. On reaching 70, he applied for the old age pension.  He was then living with the daughter, who had married in the meantime.  The pension officer came along to investigate the case.  He looked at the house, which was a nice, tidy one, whitewashed and all that kind of business, and estimated the means of the applicant. This man had no claim whatever on his daughter at this time. The pension officer allowed 3/- weekly and told the man that he would get no more as long as he lived in the house with his daughter. The pensioner then left and went to live five miles away in a rented cabin into which he put furniture. He then got a pension of 10/- weekly.  The pension officer <Col N="1905" /> told him that if he went back to live with the daughter the amount would be reduced to 3/- weekly.  Surely where a section of the Old Age Pension Act causes a man to leave his daughter's house and go and rent one for himself and pay for light, fuel and furniture it should be repealed, because it is of no advantage to the State and it is no saving to the Exchequer.  One would think that any paternal Government would make life easier for such a person when, as a result, there would be no extra demand on the Exchequer.  I wish to know if it is the intention of the Government that such a person as the man I have mentioned should be put to all the expense, inconvenience and other hardships consequent on having to go and live by himself in a small, miserable and badly-furnished cabin.  I would also like to know if it is the intention of the Government, by keeping this section on the Statute Book, to make it impossible, in many cases, for the aged father or mother to live with a son or daughter.  If so, then it is evident to every person that this Government has a most reactionary outlook, and it is also evident to every person that the policy of the Government is directed towards straining family ties that are so dear in the Irish home.  But if that is not the policy of the Government, then there should be no difficulty in removing this sub-section from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Government will meet us with the cry of no money. My reply is that where there is a will there is a way.  If the will is there there will be no difficulty in providing money for this Bill in the same way as money was provided to the extent of thousands of pounds which were made available for pensions for able-bodied young men, some of whom are on the opposite benches, and in the same way that money was made available to promote the motor industry in foreign countries by a recent Vote in this House.  I spoke on the other sections last night, so I will not deal with them any further now.  I might <Col N="1906" /> mention that the Minister for Lands and Fisheries stated in Tralee, early last year, that Fianna Fáil had no policy.  I tell the Minister here that this Bill is an indication of the policy of Fianna Fáil, and that Fianna Fáil stands for giving facilities to the aged poor to spend their declining years in comparative comfort and removing as far as possible the anxieties attendant on a precarious home and a precarious income.  I hope Deputies on the opposite benches will vote in accordance with the dictates of their consciences.  If they do I have no fear for the passage of this Bill into law.</P>

The Minister for Finance moved a Vote for old age pensions of £920,000&mdash;nearly a million of money.  How was that received by the Dáil?  Where was all the enthusiasm when the Minister for Finance came along with a Vote of nearly a million pounds for our poor people?  He was received with every good wish on the Government side of the House, but another side, which might be regarded as comprising the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties, voted broadly against it, and if they had their way, if the motion had been defeated last Thursday, not a pensioner in the twenty-six counties could go to the post offices on April 1st and receive one penny of their pensions.  I would like them to put that to their consciences and to ask themselves whether they were making a proper gesture to our poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ward comes along now in a wave of enthusiasm and he wants £300,000.  He forgets altogether that the Minister for Finance increased the vote for old age pensions last year by £40,000 or £50,000.  Deputy Ward comes along now to insist that £300,000 should be made available. Since I came into the Dáil no section of my countrymen or countrywomen have been made such a handle for political propaganda as these poor old pensioners.  Some years ago, through sheer necessity, the Minister <Col N="1907" /> for Finance had to take a shilling off the pensions.  The reason why he had to do that is well known.  The Government were in a tight corner; millions of money were required for the destruction that had taken place and that they had to take on their shoulders.  To the credit of the Minister for Finance, he was able, with improvements in the State, to give back the shilling; he was able to give an additional £40,000 last year, and he will be able to do all that will be required for improving the conditions of the old age pensioners, in view of the prospects for the future, if he is only given fair play.</P>
    <P>But was it fair that Deputies should come here on Thursday and should try to deprive the old age pensioners of their money on the 1st April?  I pin my faith with the utmost confidence to the Minister for Finance with regard to the poor old age pensioners.  I believe he is honest and sincere in his anxiety to do the best for them, considering the numerous appeals that are constantly being made to him for money for different things.  We will see how things will develop when he gets his loan.  Will they be enthusiastic for him to start another Shannon scheme?  I remember last year when the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked for only £150,000 of a vote on account how you all sneered, how not a word was in his favour, or in favour of the Shannon scheme.  You are all shouting laudations of it now because it is a great success.  Later on the Government, with prudence and discrimination will start other industries that will be reproductive, that will being back money, and that will not sink the State.  Coming back to the pensioners, I sincerely hope that nobody will be carried away by Deputy Ward's propaganda.  I am sure that the old age pensioners will resent the thought that the men now proposing to come to the rescue with £300,000 would, if they had their way, have seen that not one of them would have received a shilling on the 1st of next April.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I am very glad that we have had a statement of policy from the Government benches.  It is not usual to get such a lucid, clear and definite statement of policy, and I hope that we will not get a contradiction of it from the two Ministers who are now sitting on the front bench.  He pilloried the Labour Party for voting against what Deputy Sheehy described as the old age pensioners on last Thursday, but I am afraid that I cannot congratulate him on the accuracy of that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The Deputy has the official report in his hand. I can only speak for the Party that I have the privilege of sitting with. I cannot say why Fianna Fáil voted as they did on that occasion.  I want to say definitely that it was not to keep the old age pensions from the pensioners that we voted against the Vote on account.  We voted, not against the old age pensioners but against the policy of the Government, on account of how they proposed to spend the money that the country has entrusted to them.  Probably if I were asked on that occasion why I voted against the Vote on Account I would say it was because the Government had not introduced a measure such as that introduced yesterday evening by Deputy Ward; but it was not to withhold the money from the old age pensioners on the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In examining this measure I would like to differentiate at the outset between what one might describe as bad and biased administration and defects that there are in the legislation that we have.  I think the spirit of that legislation did embrace a good many more people than are at present enjoying old age pensions. I have always thought it a pity that members of the Executive Council have not what one might describe as a back-ground of experience in their administration of matters of this kind, because therein they would have learned much that they could never learn otherwise in the matter of public social services.  On several <Col N="1909" /> occasions, I, as well as other Deputies, have raised the question as to why people were assessed at the rate of ten per cent. on what has been described as capital.  Leaving out of account the fact that it is next to impossible to secure any return of that kind from even large amounts of capital, one is justified in asking whether one can describe as capital either the money in the bank or the property that some people have when they look for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of what this capital does really represent.  It represents to a certain extent the savings and the sacrifices of these people.  It represents a kind of insurance, to preserve them in their old age from perhaps the workhouse ward.  When we consider the position of people with small holdings, with three, four or five cows, who look for the pension, we find that their position is, indeed, a difficult one when they go to transfer the holding to a son or a daughter.  In the transfer of a holding of that kind there is always the introduction into the household of a stranger, either a husband or a wife, and there is always at the back of the mind of the old person, conservative with age, the feeling that the influence of that stranger may be felt throughout the household.  These people, during their lifetime, have been scraping, have been sacrificing some luxuries, if you can describe them as luxuries, have been denying themselves some refinements in clothing, perhaps denying themselves tobacco, to protect themselves from what is a horror to them&mdash;pauperism, and all that goes with it.  That mentality may not be understood by Ministers, but I am sure it is understood by a good many of the Deputies sitting behind the Ministers, and I hope it will induce them not to do violence to their consciences in the way they vote on this measure.  You are putting, to a great extent, a tax upon the industry of these people when you assess whatever property or money they possess at the rate of ten per cent.  You are putting a tax on industry and thrift, and, on the <Col N="1910" /> other hand, you are putting a tax on the fidelity of the children towards them.  If they do give them some shelter and food you are putting a tax upon their fidelity to their parents.  That is a thing that should not exist to-day; it is a relie of barbarism.</P>
    <P>I do know of some cases where such things are taken into account as a few miserable pounds that perhaps a son or daughter sends from America at Christmas or Easter, or where a father or mother can live periodically with a son or daughter it is taken into account.  When the son or daughter inherits a small farm from the father or mother they inherit all the responsibilities, the liabilities, the annuities, the taxes and the expenses incidental to that farm, and there is not in that farm sufficient to maintain the father and mother.  There is no use in suggesting that there is, and according to the present rate of assessment these people will be cut out of the old age pension.</P>
    <P>There is a matter I had hoped the Deputy would have developed.  That is with reference to the pensions committees.  I did suggest here on the Vote on Account on which Deputy Sheehy harangued us, but the Minister for Finance did not seem to take very serious cognisance of it, that as at present constituted the pensions committees are of little or no value, because they have no power whatever.  When an applicant makes a claim the pension officer investigates the case.  The pensions committee decides for or against, but the pension officer appeals, as it suits himself, to the Local Government Department. I am not making any case against the officer deciding in the Local Government Department.  Consistent with the power they have got within legislation and with the evidence before them, I think that branch of the Local Government Department deal as fairly as it is possible to deal with the cases that come before them on appeal.  The only objection I have to them is the barbed wire fence that the Minister for Local Government has put around <Col N="1911" /> these officers to prevent anybody from approaching them.  What I would like to make of the pensions committees would be something that would be useful to the Local Government Department and to the claimants. I do know, and everybody who has any experience of the administration of local committees knows, that most claimants for pensions find it very difficult to make their cases orally, and when they are asked to put their case on paper on appeal they are handicapped very much.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance of just one case to illustrate what I mean.  I knew an old couple.  The old woman applied for the pension.  The Pensions Committee granted it, but the pension officer appealed.  An officer was sent down to investigate.  He came to the husband of the applicant and asked him did he work all the year round.  The man said he worked about three or four months of the year.  The officer asked: &ldquo;Do you get any money when you are idle?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I get 26/- a week.&rdquo;  What did he mean?  He meant definitely that he got a certain amount of unemployment insurance when he was unemployed for perhaps six weeks.  The officer reported that the man got £1 6s. a week when idle, and that he worked for the remainder of the year.  When the man came to me and told me that his wife was disallowed the pension on these grounds, I took the matter up with the Local Government Department and got it adjusted properly. What I would like is that the pensions committees would state definitely and clearly on what they base their decisions, how they arrive at the decision that John Sullivan or Tom Murphy is entitled to the old age pension, and that they would give the Local Government Department something to go on and which would make it much easier for the applicants, especially for those who are not able to state their case.  The Deputy has not referred, I think, to the Committee at all in the Bill, and I would like that on the Committee Stage he would do something that would make it useful both to the <Col N="1912" /> Local Government Department and to the applicant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ward has made certain statements arising out of Section 2 of this Bill which, I think, he ought not to make and simply leave there without any evidence, good, bad or indifferent to support them.  He suggests that under the British administration paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911 was practically not enforced except in respect of the benefit or the privilege that was involved or the benefit or privilege legally coming to the person.  He draws a distinction between the spirit of the administration of that particular section under the British and the spirit of the administration now.  He makes the additional statement that the Department of Local Government and Public Health in dealing with appeals, or in the part of the work they have to deal with, are at variance with the Department of Finance.  I deny both the first and the second of these suggestions.  I think, if the Deputy cannot bring forward any substantiation of them, that some modification of his statement is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> As far as the first part of Section 2 is concerned, one of the main things it means is that the maintenance of persons who are applying for the old age pension in the place where they are being maintained shall be disregarded and that persons who are fully maintained, clothed and fed shall be entitled to the full 10/- pension once they come to the age of seventy, apart altogether from the kind of maintenance which they receive.  There never was an intention in introducing the Old Age Pension Act that that should be so. It is not our intention at present that that shall be so.  The additional cost that that would mean is of such a nature that there is no prospect of the Executive Council agreeing to a change in the position that would bring that about.  We have to compare the amount that is paid for old age pensions at present with the amount that is paid for other social services and we have to see how these things differ, say, in certain counties.</P>
    <P>Take the total cost of old age pensions. Deputy Ward says, arising out of certain other statements that were made, that we ought to pay attention to the way in which our social services are developed here so that there shall be no disparity between the social services here and the social services in other places. When we deal with our social services, such as they are, we must see that we get the best results from the money that is being spent.  If we look at the amount of money spent on old age pensions and the amount of money spent by the different local bodies in connection with the poor law, we must ask ourselves whether we shall get better social services by an increase of moneys under the poor law or an increase of moneys under old age pensions.  The total cost of old age pensions at present is £2,735,000.  Before the Act of 1928, it was something like £200,000 less than that.  I want to take the figures for the year ended March, 1928, and compare them with the moneys expended under the poor law for that year.  The expenditure for old age pensions for the year ended March, <Col N="1915" /> 1928, was £2,525,218.  The expenditure under the poor law for medical charities, institutions, out-door relief and salaries and pensions of the officers concerned was £1,657,479.  So that we were spending on old age pensions half as much again as we were spending on the whole of our poor law services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There were special parts of the country in which the discrepancy was very much greater.  We were spending in Mayo more than five times the amount on old age pensions that was being expended in Mayo on medical charities and poor law institutions, such as hospitals and county homes, and out-door relief.  In Donegal, we were spending more than three and a half times the amount spent on the poor law. One of the reasons is that the size of the holdings in these areas was such that the costs of maintenance, in assessing whether the persons were entitled to pensions or not, were more eliminated than they were in some of the eastern counties.  The percentage of farmers living on holdings of fifteen acres and less in Mayo was 47.5; in Donegal it was 46.5. The average value of the holdings of from ten to fifteen acres in Mayo was £4 15s., and in Donegal £4 12s.</P>
    <P>The result was that maintenance was hardly taken into consideration when considering old age pensions at all and then we have the cost of old age pensions in these areas soaring to five times in Mayo and three and a half times in Donegal the amount expended on poor law relief generally.  If maintenance is not to be taken into consideration in assessing persons' means when they apply for an old age pension, you can rely on having something like that increase in the expenditure on old age pensions as compared with the expenditure on poor law; that is, on medical charities, institutions and home assistance you can expect an increase of that particular kind over those areas where now, because of the size of the farms upon which the people live, maintenance is taken into consideration pretty much.  So <Col N="1916" /> that, while an estimate may be given of £200,000 or £250,000 as a result of the operation of Section 2 of this Bill, if it is passed, that figure might very easily be exceeded.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the section, the proposal is that approximately £50,000, now borne by local authorities for the maintenance of the old people in institutions, should be transferred from the local authorities to the pensions fund.  From the beginning, old age pensions have been dissociated from poor relief, but the change that has taken place in the administration of poor law, with the doing away of workhouses and the setting up of county homes, has bridged over to some extent the difference between old age pensions and some assistance given locally to old people.  But, when you take into consideration the discrepancy between the amount paid in old age pensions in the different counties and the amount spent in poor law, there is very little case for taking another £50,000 and transferring it from the shoulders of local authorities to the Central Fund, which is already bearing two and three quarter millions for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>The point has been raised that persons in receipt of old age pensions when they enter poor law institutions or hospitals lose their pensions for the time being and that if they leave these institutions they have very considerable difficulty in getting the pensions restored to them.  In fact, that is not so.  The matter has had a good deal of consideration, and Deputies will find that in practice when an old age pensioner proposes to leave such an institution he can make the necessary application for the restoration of his pension a month or so before he leaves and that very little time elapses between his leaving the institution and his getting the pension again.  I understand there is not, and certainly there ought not to be, any very great difficulty in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) would give rise to very great anomalies and would leave persons with pensions to which they would not be entitled.  As the <Col N="1917" /> position is at present, when one of a couple of the kind contemplated dies, the case is gone into again entirely on its merits as if it were a fresh application by the old age pensioner involved.  The case is decided on the new facts, and decided with a very considerable amount of sympathy as well.</P>
    <P>The point is made by Deputy Ward that the actual operation in practice of Section 7 (1) of the Act of 1924 is that a person who assigns his farm within three years of his being 70 years of age may get himself into the position that if he applies for the pension a week before the three years have elapsed from the date of his assigning the farm, he may be deprived of his old age pension for all time.  The original intention of the sub-section was that a person who continued after he was 67 years of age in the possession of a holding of a particular kind could not assign, for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Act, the income of that particular holding; that is, when he came to apply for the old age pension at the age of 70 that the income from the holding which he held when he was 67 would be taken into consideration and continued in consideration in respect of his pension. About 1928 it transpired that this sub-section did not actually effect what it was intended to effect, and that, in fact, what it effected was that for a period of three years such a person would have taken into consideration as part of his means the income he might expect from holding such a farm, but that after three years he was completely clear of any effect from the holding of that farm. When his means for pension purposes were being assessed.  Just as there was confusion from 1924 to 1928 arising out of it being understood that a certain effect was achieved by the Act, so there has apparently been, subsequent to 1928, some confusion with regard to the application of the legal decision then given.  But I doubt if the Deputy can point to any case of the kind that he mentioned.  I would be very glad to hear of such a case, because <Col N="1918" /> it is not the interpretation of this sub-section that it does anything other than secure for the period of three years after the assigning of the farm that the income of that farm will be taken into consideration as part of the person's means when assessing them for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>The section was originally intended to prevent persons after 67 years of age assigning a farm or land for the purposes of the assessment of their means for an old age pension.  In the middle of 1928, however, legal opinion decided that the section did not, in fact, effect what it was intended to effect, and from 1928 the interpretation put on the section is, that it simply secures that for three years after the date of assigning the land the person's income from that land will be taken into consideration as part of his means in connection with an old age pension, but not after three years from the date of assigning.</P>

      <P>I am explaining what the position is, and I am saying that I seriously doubt whether the type of case suggested here actually does take place, and I would be glad to have some evidence to the effect that it does, because as there was confusion before 1928, so, apparently, there is some confusion after 1928, when there should be no confusion. But generally, as I say, the answer to all these questions is that we are spending two-and-three quarter millions on these pensions <Col N="1919" /> although, as Deputy Ward, who introduced the measure, said, according to the law administered as it is being administered, no one ought to get a pension in the country.  There is very great discrepancy between the description of the administration of the law at the moment, and the fact that we are spending two-and-three quarter millions on old age pensions, although we are only spending less than two-thirds of that on our Poor Law.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been introduced as an honest effort on the part of Fianna Fáil to remove many grievances from which claimants to old age pensions suffer at the present moment.  The Minister has just said that the answer, from his side, to the different amendments sought in this Bill, is that we are spending two-and-three-quarter millions on old age pensions.  That is not an answer.  If for instance, the number of old age pensioners increased in the coming year he might have to spend £300,000 more.  It is no answer at all to say that because we are spending two-and-three-quarter millions, if there is a good case made out for spending another quarter of a million that it should not be found and spent.  We maintain that that case is made out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the latter part of Section 2 of this Bill.  That section deals with the case of a person who goes into a county home and who loses his old age pension.  The Poor Law Commission considered that matter and in paragraph 314, page 83, found that £50,000 could be saved if old age pensioners were not deprived of their pensions when seeking relief in the county home.  The Minister stated that we made no case for the relief of the ratepayer of this £50,000 at the expense of the taxpayer.  Now the ratepayer is the taxpayer, and the ratepayers, who are paying this £50,000, are mostly the farmers of this country who pay 80 per cent. of the taxes.  There is no argument at all why the ratepayer should not be relieved of that £50,000 which is saved <Col N="1920" /> in that way to the Central Fund. They have to pay it, one way or another, and it is mean to say that because a man has to go into the county home he must forfeit his pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that when a man intends to leave the county home he can apply for his pension a month before he leaves and when he comes out he will find his pension waiting for him.  The Minister must know, at least any person conversant with life in the county homes and such institutions must know, that no inmate of these homes will decide, a month before he leaves to go on his annual holidays or his triennial holidays, to apply for his pension.  Take a person going into the county hospital. He can retain his pension for three months while he is there, but if suffering from some chronic type of disease he has to face the fact that if he is not cured of that disease in three months he loses his pension.  That is not very conducive to his recovery and it is not humane. If it takes him more than three months to get well of that chronic complaint he must either leave the hospital or lose his pension.  That is the law as it stands.  The Minister made the point that the Act is not administered in that way.  If it is not administered in that way why leave it there at all?  Why not repeal the section which deprives people of pensions while in workhouses or if they stay in the hospital longer than three months.  That is all the Bill is intended to do.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, it is a deterrent to any claimant for an old age pension to improve his home or the buildings attached to his farm. We have spent a good deal of time passing Housing Acts and Government Departments are busy in granting loans for housing.  The Board of Works is busy granting loans for the improvement of out-offices on farms, but a man getting on in years will not seek a loan to improve his house or to put up a hayshed, because his valuation will go up, and if his valuation goes up, and if he applies for an old age pension, he will be refused.  That is a great deterrent. <Col N="1921" /> The old figure of £10 valuation is a bad figure, and it is a particularly bad figure in the West of Ireland, because 70 per cent. of the farms in the West of Ireland, and in a good part of the South of Ireland, had valuations ranging from £9 to £11. A man with a valuation of £9 13s. or £9 17s. 6d. is better off than a man with a valuation of £10 2s. 6d., although there is very little difference in the holdings.  The Minister must know that new holdings, under the Land Commission, or new holdings under the old Congested Districts Board, are far more highly valued than holdings that adjoin them.  The valuation, in these cases, very often is double the valuation of the adjoining holdings. When these people come along to apply for old age pensions they are faced with this valuation. The pension officer appeals on the ground of means, and in many cases the appeal is upheld.  That is why in this Bill we want to get away from the £10 valuation and want to raise it to £12, exclusive of buildings.  The reason for that is that if any man wants to improve his house or out-offices, or to put up a hay-shed or new barn, the moment he does so his valuation goes up.  That is a deterrent to farmers who try to improve their holdings.  The aim of the Bill is to exclude the buildings from valuation and to leave the valuation at £12 instead of the old figure of £10.  The Bill seeks to remedy many grievances inflicted by the 1924 Act. Deputy Hogan, I think, referred to Section 4, in which the British were content to take the value at one-twentieth, but in 1924 this House came along with an Act that made the value one-tenth.  Of course, they will tell us that they set aside £25, but, in the case of a holding valued at £300, the setting aside of £25 would not mean much, one way or the other.  The Bill will remedy what is undoubtedly an outstanding grievance.</P>
    <P>The Minister in dealing with Section 3 said that the survivor's pension was always treated as if he had made a new application and, in most cases, was treated with the utmost sympathy.  Surely it is sufficient loss <Col N="1922" /> for a man of eighty or eighty-five years to be deprived of his life-long partner without having his case reopened. Will the Department say in how many cases they increased the pension?  If they met these cases with sympathy the only sympathy these people want is to be allowed to finish their last years in peace and comfort.  A lot of money cannot be saved in the case of widows or widowers, who are very few and who in ordinary circumstances, have not more than a year or two to live.  In regard to Section 2 it has been stated that the clause is not harshly interpreted, but Deputy O'Reilly has quoted the case of an old age pensioner in Kerry who left his daughter's house where he had lived for many years and went to live by himself in a cabin.  In his daughter's home he had a certain amount of comfort, was looked after, kept clean, and his food was properly cooked.  He got 3/- a week pension, but, because of the interpretation of this section, he had to forego these comforts, leave a comfortable house, and live in solitude, thus probably shortening his days, in order to qualify for a pension.  If the Act was not harshly interpreted there would have been no reason for him to leave his daughter's home.  Many Deputies could, I am sure, give hundreds of such cases.  I mentioned a case here in 1927 in which an old age pensioner went to live with his son who had returned from America and bought a farm about twenty miles from the old home.  The son took the father to live with him and on that account the father's pension was reduced from 8/- to 5/-.  I inquired into the matter and I was told that the son had six cows.  He had, and the old man had to leave the son's house because of those six cows who provided milk for him to drink.  That old man went back to his old home and got 8/- a week, but he lived only for a week to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>We propose to repeal that clause. If it is not harshly interpreted and is interpreted in the magnanimous and wonderful spirit in which the Minister tells us it is interpreted, <Col N="1923" /> then it is as good for the Ministry to repeal it, because all we are asking for is to give the matter more sympathetic treatment.  Mention was made that Fianna Fáil, in conjunction with Labour, had voted against the Vote for old age pensions. The argument was too silly to heed, but I suppose it will get a fair Press.  We voted against the Vote on Account because there were not many items in it with which we agreed.  We agreed with a few of them.  We disagreed with the Vote for old age pensions only because it was not large enough.  We believe that money could be found for social services just as it has been found for military and other services which are not as necessary.  No case has been made so far against this Bill, and I am certain that there are Deputies on the other benches who are quite prepared to vote for the Bill if the Whips are withdrawn.  If the Minister would like to see what the feeling of the House is, let him take off the Whips.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to mention, and that is that if this Bill is passed, as I hope it will, the most needy section of the community will benefit.  After all, when we get a copy of the Estimates and see that the Estimates amount to over £21,000,000, surely it should be easy to find another £200,000 for the purposes of this Bill.  That sum added to the Estimates would not bring the total amount over twenty-one and a half millions.  Money can always be found when it is necessary to find it for purposes which could, at least, be shelved for a time.  Blind persons are also affected under this Bill, because the few people who are in receipt of blind pensions would also benefit in the same proportion as old age pensioners if the Bill were passed.  In making a comparison, the Minister mentioned Mayo and Donegal, and picked out those counties to show that they spend five times more on old age pensions than on the purposes of the Medical Charities Act. The Minister picked the counties with very poor valuations.  Let him take counties like Westmeath and Roscommon.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill has had one good effect at any rate.  The Minister has undertaken that if we write to him about cases cited by Deputy Dr. Ward and by Deputy O'Reilly, under Section 5 of this Bill, he will seek to rectify the matters complained of.  We will all have great pleasure in writing to the Minister about these cases.  We are very glad to get his assurance that he is now going to put them right.  It may be so much good done. This Bill is very necessary to remove the stringency and the rigorous adherence to the letter of the law, especially appeals, as carried out by the old age pensions officers throughout the country.  They are absolute masters in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  As Deputy Hogan has stated, sub-committees have no power.  The old age pensions <Col N="1925" /> officer is the despot in the matter.  He is unapproachable.  It is always with fear and trembling that I go near the old age pensions officer in my area.  He is wrapped in red tape.  He is as sacred as the Ark, and the Minister for Local Government has seen to it that the appeals which he makes are guarded in the Department of Local Government. We are told, when we complain about him, that he does not belong to the Local Government Department; that he belongs to the Department of Finance.  And when you go to the Department of Finance you are referred to the Department of Local Government&mdash;each for all, and all for each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument put up by the Minister was a mathematical comparison between the amount of money spent in the rural areas and the amount of money spent out of the Central Fund on old age pensions. I did not know that the Minister was a convert to Sovietism, but it is apparent to-night that he is. He regrets that more money should be spent centrally than in the rural areas.  Which of the voices is speaking? Is it the voice that talks about the Greater Dublin Bill or the voice that advocates equal expenditure of moneys in the local areas with the expenditure of money at the top? What has that got to do with it? Deputy Ward contended in introducing the Bill that in a similar social service in the North of Ireland and in Great Britain there were far more equitable terms.  For instance, a person in the North of Ireland can be in receipt of £26 5s. earned income, and £39 unearned income and yet receive a pension of ten shillings per week.  All he can be in receipt of in the Saorstát is £15 12s. 6d.  The Deputy also contended that in the North of Ireland a person can be in receipt of £49 12s. 6d. earned income and £39 unearned income and be entitled to a pension of one shilling per week.  We thought we would get from the Minister for Local Government an answer to that.  The answer we got was an answer about the relative moneys spent on old age <Col N="1926" /> pensions and on medical charities in Co. Donegal.  We thought that we would get the relative moneys spent on old age pensions and on medical charities in Co. Tyrone, spent on local administration in Tyrone and that that would be compared with the amount spent in Donegal.  That would be a comparison, but the answer which the Minister gave us left us in the dark.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 2 of this Bill, it repeals paragraph (d) of sub-section 2 of the Act of 1911.  It has been contended as I said at the outset that there is a rigorous adherence to the letter of the law in the matter.  I have before me a good example which will illustrate the point I want to make.  An old pair down my way sold a farm of land.  They were compelled to sell it; it was the only bit of land they had and they got £160 for it, a year and a half ago.  The father and son were jointly responsible in a bank for a debt of £200; all that sum of £160 went into the bank to clear off the debt.  The mother had attained the age of seventy and she applied for the pension.  She got a grant of only six shillings per week on the grounds that the money obtained for the land was there.  The parties stated that the money went to pay the debt. I made representations to the pension officer pointing out that the money went to pay the debt, but the pensions officer stuck his heels in the ground and stated that until he had affidavits from the bank manager, the cashier and from the son and the father he would not recommend an increase.  Meanwhile the son was told by somebody, ignorantly told of course, that if it became known to the Government that this money went to pay the joint bill he would be imprisoned for not maintaining his father and consequently he would not make the affidavit.  The bank manager could not make the affidavit either, without his consent. I made that clear to the Department of Local Government.  I made it clear to the inspector before we were stopped interviewing the officials of the Department of Local Government. Yet not alone was the <Col N="1927" /> woman's pension not increased but the man who is now seventy is to be deprived of any pension because of the £160.  That is due to the rigorous adherence to that paragraph of sub-section 2 of the Act of 1911.</P>
    <P>I could give other examples.  Perhaps different officers administer the Act in different ways.  In the Sinn Féin days, when the whole system of Local Government was under review, one of the things advocated by Sinn Féin was a removal of the stigma of pauperism from the poor law.  The idea of the workhouse was a home of rest for the aged poor such as you have here in Dublin in several Catholic institutions and several Protestant institutions where people can go in when they are past their labours and be treated as Christians and live decently while being well clothed and nourished. The English rule here after the famine put the stigma of pauperism on these homes and made them places that were looked upon in the public eye as degraded by pauperism. Propaganda to that effect was spread.  Instead of being homes of rest for the aged, they became places into which people would rather do anything else than enter at the end of their days.  That was the idea that existed when the matter of amalgamation of unions was raised.  Now, amalgamation was a pre-Truce and a pre-Treaty idea.  Its object was to remove the stigma of pauperism from these institutions and to institute county homes and county hospitals for the aged poor.  The Act of 1919 and the previous Acts about pensions for people in workhouses were drafted with the mentality of people who had lowered the status of these places.  When an endeavour is being made to raise their status and to make them suitable homes for the aged poor, surely there should be support for such an idea. This section, paragraph (a) of Section 3 of the Act of 1919, should be repealed, and these people should be entitled to receive their pensions while in the homes or in the hospitals. After paying for themselves they would be given whatever balance <Col N="1928" /> remains to buy little comforts for themselves, as is permitted in these homes in the City of Dublin that are run by Catholic and Protestant organisations.  The repealing of that paragraph in that section would do a great deal to carry out the idea behind the principle of amalgamation. I would like to direct the attention of the House to Section 3 of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Act of 1908 and sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Act of 1911 shall be amended to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  In calculating the means of a person being one of a married couple living together in the same house, the means shall be taken to be half the total means of the couple, and the subsequent death of either of such couple shall not operate to decrease the pension already awarded to the survivor.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the case of a man who is practically blind.  He and his wife were in receipt of a pension of 9/- a week.  The wife died, and immediately this man was cut down 2/- a week in his pension, though he was so blind that he had to be led about the house.  Fortunately, after numerous appeals to the Local Government Department, this money that was cut off the pension was restored, but he suffered the loss for practically a year.  That was how that semi-blind man was treated.  It is a hardship when an old couple are in receipt of a pension for a considerable number of years and, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, when they reach the age of eighty they are sometimes cut down in their pensions.  If I had anything to do with the giving of pensions to aged people I would have legislation passed that would increase the pension to them when they reach the age of eighty, and give a further increase at ninety.  I would give a big bounty to the old age pensioner who would reach a hundred years.  Certainly, I would not stand for the system of cutting down a man in his pension when he reached eighty years of age <Col N="1929" /> or over.  But that is the policy of the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance, and the old age pension section which dances between the two.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 indicates that the Ministry must be aware of some wonderful sources open to investors. They drafted the original paragraph on the assumption that people got 10 per cent. for their investments.  In the ordinary way, to arrive at the income from capital one takes a figure of 20 and divides it into the capital.  Five per cent. is considered a fair and steady dividend.  It would be a very good dividend out of a farm at present.  The Minister for Agriculture, who is such a practical farmer, shook his head the other day on the Government Benches when this matter was mentioned and he said to a Deputy: &ldquo;It is well for you that you are not depending on farming.&rdquo;  He knows what farming is, practical man as he is.  I am sure that his hands are furrowed and made horny from the work they do on the farm.  The farmer who gets five per cent. out of his farm at present is doing very well. I would advise the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Finance to consult the Minister for Agriculture on this particular matter.  I said already that this debate did one practical good.  It secured an undertaking from the Minister for Local Government that he would now consider all these cases of injustice that we know of where a person who applied within three years for a pension after assigning his holding over to a son or daughter would have justice done to him.  As I said, we will have great pleasure in putting up those cases to him now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government in the course of his remarks made reference to the expenditure for old age pensions in the counties Donegal and Mayo.  At the same time, the Minister is not aware that so far as Donegal and Mayo are concerned the very greatest discontent exists not alone amongst old age pensioners but also <Col N="1930" /> amongst members of the pensions committees owing to the way in which the Act is administered.  I can quite realise the attitude the Minister for Local Government has taken up in view of the fact that a short time ago he informed Deputies in this House that since he was elected as Deputy for Dublin City North he had never received letters from persons who made application for old age pensions and had not received them.  I might say that the same cannot be said of any Deputy in this House representing a rural constituency, especially such counties as Donegal and Mayo to which the Minister made special reference. There is no gainsaying the fact that the greatest discontent exists both in regard to the administration of the Act for old age pensions and the Act itself.  The Minister will remember that as a result of the 1924 Act some of the old age pensions were cut by one, two, three, or four shillings.  As a result of a motion introduced by this Party in 1928 we succeeded in refunding to some old pensioners the one shilling that had been stopped from them.  It should be taken into consideration that the complete cut made by the 1924 Act has not yet been restored to pensioners.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I believe it will go a little way to allay the existing discontent.  I would like to have seen the Bill going a little further.  I would like to have seen it suggested that the age at which applicants should receive pensions would be reduced from 70 to 65 years.  It may be stated that if the eligible age is reduced to 65 years a big additional expenditure will be incurred; but after all the question of old age pensions should not be viewed, as some of the Ministers, and more especially the Minister for Local Government, are apt to view it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be taken into consideration that when a person reaches 65 years and has been purchasing a certain amount of commodities from the time he commences work until he reaches that age, he has contributed <Col N="1931" /> a certain amount to the State in the way of taxation and also through work, if he happened to be fortunate enough to have work, and he has done his share in building up the State.  In the circumstances the State owes a debt to that man, and the question of giving him a pension should not be looked upon from the viewpoint of the Minister, namely, the viewpoint of pauperism or poor law relief.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I am sorry that Deputy Ward did not see fit to repeal the First Schedule of the 1924 Act, because it will be recollected that as far as the First Schedule is concerned it lays down the maximum amount of means which claimants for pensions are entitled to receive.  It is disadvantageous to the applicant in comparison with the First Schedule of the 1919 Act.  Under that Act the person whose means were less than £26 5s. was entitled to a pension of 10/-.  Under the 1924 Act, as amended by the motion brought forward here by our Party in 1928, a person is allowed to have a maximum means of £15 12s. before he or she is entitled to receive a maximum pension of 10/-.  Under the 1919 Act the applicant was allowed to have an income of 10/- a week, and allowed also a pension of 10/- a week.  That was tantamount to saying that under the 1919 Act an old age pensioner could have £1 per week of an income and pension, whereas under the 1924 Act the maximum amount the pensioner could have would be 15/-, including both means and pension.  I hope this Bill does become an Act, and that Deputies on the Government Benches will look on the matter not from the point of view of party, but from the point of view of their constituents.  I believe it will remove a number of anomalies.</P>
    <P>[<i>Mr. Fahy took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies is the fact that at present an applicant for a pension who happens to be totally dependent on a married son or daughter will in no case be entitled <Col N="1932" /> to the maximum pension of 10/-.  I understand the pension officer in calculating the means takes into consideration that if a claimant is living with a married son or daughter it amounts to an income of £26 a year. That is unfair because it means in effect that a person in order to get 10/- a week must live on the roadside and have no means of income. In many cases we find claimants living with relatives who are very poor, hardly able to support themselves and their wives and families, let alone to keep the old people.  Nevertheless the claimant is victimised by the fact that he or she is dependent on some relative.  This Bill will help to remedy in some way that particular grievance.</P>
    <P>Another grievance arises from the fact that if an old age pensioner finds he has to go to the county home, immediately his pension is stopped. That means transferring the burden from the taxpayer to the shoulders of the ratepayer.  If a pensioner goes to the county home for medical treatment the pension is stopped and in most cases a period of four months elapses before he can get the pension back.  If before entering the county home the pensions committee, the pension officer and even the appeals officer considered a person was entitled to a pension surely the mere fact of entering the county home for medical treatment should not deprive the poor person of his pension?</P>

      <P>I understand that in many cases after the pensioner receives medical treatment a period of four months elapses before the pension is resumed.  If the Minister will refer to the proceedings of the Committee of Inquiry that investigated old age pensions he will find that that was one of the chief complaints. In many cases a pensioner has to make a fresh application before he can again get the pension. This Bill aims at removing that defect. I am very sorry it does not go further.  I would like to have seen a section giving pensions at 65 <Col N="1933" /> years.  I hope Deputies will look on this Bill from the point of view of their constituents.  They know that dissatisfaction exists about old age pensions and they know the anomalies in the present Act.  They should endeavour to get these anomalies rectified and I suggest the best way is to vote for Deputy Ward's Bill.</P>

      <P>I desire to support this Bill.  So far as the present Ministry is concerned, they do not seem to have views on anything outside a radius of five miles of Dublin.  They seem to think that the whole of the 26 counties is contained within that radius.  I am not at all surprised that the Minister for Local Government never had any complaints with regard to old age pensions.  I happened to attend a meeting of an old age pensions committee in Cork to-day.  I will cite, for the benefit of the Minister, two cases that came before us.  One was the application of an old woman living with her son, who has a wife and three young children.  He has a farm of 30 acres, the stock consisting of five cows, a couple of sheep and dry stock. Under a marriage agreement, the old woman was entitled to her maintenance in the house.  The pensions officer valued her maintenance at 16/- a week.  The land held by her son is poor, the valuation of the 30 acres being £14.  Does any farmer Deputy listening to me imagine that out of a farm like that that 16/- a week could be paid when you consider that her son, his wife and three children had also to get their support out of it?  A farmer would need to be making a great deal more money than the Minister for Finance thinks that farmers are making to be able to pay 16/- a week out of a holding like that for the maintenance of this old lady.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced with the object of trying to bring about some improvement amongst a section of the community that comprises the real producers in this State.  The second case that came before the committee to-day was that of an old man, 70 years of age, who has spent <Col N="1934" /> the whole of his life as a farm labourer.  In this case, apparently, the pensions officer cross-examined the old man with a view to finding out where he had worked during certain periods of the year.  The pensions officer wrote to the people who had given employment to the old man at odd periods.  As a result of his inquiries he found that the old man had worked 24 or 25 weeks in the year, that his wages were from four to six shillings a week with bed and board.  He immediately pounced upon that and made out that the old man had an income of £31 10s. a year, and in consequence decided that the applicant was only entitled to a few shillings a week as pension. If the old man had been one of the drones who live upon the sweat of the farming community he would have been entitled to a pension up to the maximum amount.  If he had been one of those civil servants with salaries of £1,500 a year and £210 a year war bonus, he would, when going out on pension, be entitled to fifty-eight sixtieths of his salary for the remainder of his life.  Of course if he was in that position he need not apply for the pension at all.  Because of the fact that he happens to be a poor old man, one of the producers in this country, one of those who work in order that these gentlemen to whom I have referred may live in comfort, he is to be cut down to a pension of a few shillings a week.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what scale pension officers are paid.  I have often thought that they must be paid by results, that, for instance, they get so much for each case recommended by a pensions committee which they succeed in getting turned down.  The Minister has apparently no idea of how these Acts are being administered. He said that the total cost of old age pensions was £2,725,000, and that the cost of poor law services was £1,700,000.  He said that in the County Mayo the cost of old age pensions was seven and a half times the cost of poor law services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that was because of the number of small <Col N="1935" /> holdings down there.  I suggest that it is because too many of the people in the county of Mayo went, as the President said, on a holiday to America to see their friends.  We on this side are not responsible for the policy of the Government which has driven all the young people out of the country, leaving few behind except the aged and the crippled. I suggest that it is the policy of the Government that has resulted in piling up the cost of old age pensions. We on this side are not responsible for that.  I had hoped that when the Minister for Local Government stood up to address the House he would at least show some sympathy with the producers in this country, with those who are not protected by the barbed wire entrenchments of civil service salaries and bonuses.  The Minister did not do what I had hoped he would do.  I hope, however, that Deputies from rural constituencies will show sympathy with the producers in this country.  I hope that Deputy Sheehy, the Father of the House, will not forget the old people in his own constituency in West Cork; that he will not forget those who have reached a good age like himself, and will do what he can to see that when they make application for pensions they will get them.  If the Deputy himself should ever require a pension, let him think now of that, and give his support to this Bill which, if passed, will ensure that all deserving applicants will get the pension when they reach the qualifying age. I appeal to Deputy Sheehy, and to every other Deputy from a rural constituency, most of whom have had experience of local government administration, to give their support to this Bill.  I am sure that the Deputy, like most members of the House, receives a pile of private letters every week with complaints from people as to the way in which these Acts are being administered.  If Deputy Sheehy is not already a member of an old age pensions committee I will see what I can do to have him made a member of one.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to him that he is getting a chance now he might not get for a long time again of showing to the old age pensioners in his constituency that he feels for them, and that in addition to doing a little bit for himself he should do a stroke of work for them also.  I appeal to every rural Deputy here, who must be aware of the facts, to turn around at this stage and disown the Minister for Local Government and get shut of him once and for all.  I will not say anything about the Minister for Finance, but I told a deputation that was going to him about a grant that the softest part of him was his feet.  I appeal to rural Deputies to come together on this question and not make it a party one.  We want to make no party kudos out of it.  Every Deputy who votes for the Bill has as much right to get credit for it as we have, and every Deputy who votes against it will have to face his constituents, and I warn him that they will not go without being told.  There will be very little good in telling the old age pensioners that the Minister for Local Government put down his foot and said he would not agree to what this Bill proposes.  Constituents are looking for protection against the sharks let loose from the Department of Local Government.  I hope Deputies will do their duty and support this Bill, and if they do not I hope their constituents will deal with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity for me to go <Col N="1937" /> into very much detail in connection with this Bill.  If I give one or two instances of the hardship inflicted under the present system it will, I think, be quite sufficient.  Like Deputy Corry, I also happen to be a member of an old age pensions committee. At the outset I desire to say that I differ from those who have spoken on the Bill in regard to what they said about the pensions officers in the rural districts.  Speaking from my own experience, I want to say that on the whole I have found these officers very sympathetic.  I have found that they do all they possibly can to give the widest possible interpretation to the Acts they have to administer.  They go amongst the people and make the most careful inquiries.  Time and again I have come up against cases in which pensions officers told me that they had to refuse the pension. They admitted that the applicants were practically destitute and were undoubtedly deserving cases.  They told me that, if it were in their power, they would give these people the pension, but under the Acts they were debarred from doing so.  What we are endeavouring to do under this Bill is to amend the Acts so that pension officers will not be debarred from giving pensions in these deserving cases.</P>
    <P>At practically every meeting I attend such cases come before us. It is because I know so much about them that I feel so strongly about this Bill.  There is one case of an old woman of eighty years of age to whom we gave a pension.  She went to live for a short time with her daughter-in-law and the pensions officer notified her that if she did not leave her daughter-in-law and live elsewhere he would cut down her pension to five shillings per week. How any woman could get lodgings for five shillings a week I do not know.  She tried it and had to go back to her daughter-in-law again. There are hundreds of such cases. How could any man or woman in any part of Ireland support themselves on five shillings or six shillings per week?  I admit that they are <Col N="1938" /> entitled to nine shillings or ten shillings a week when eighty years of age, but granted they have that how many old persons, and they are mostly helpless, could get any sort of lodgings for ten shillings a week? A case came before us a short time ago of a father who had assigned his place to a female relative.  A misunderstanding arose and the relative disposed of the stock on the farm and she went to America, leaving the old man destitute.  There was no stock left on the farm and he lived in a tumbled-down house.  This man could not get a pension because he had assigned the farm to his relative with the intention of getting the pension.  For that reason, although absolutely destitute, he was debarred from getting a pension.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are similar cases all over the country, as those who are familiar with the working of the Act know.  One does not like to make invidious distinctions, but I see that the cost of the Civic Guards service has increased by nearly £89,000 in the last three years. This year there is to be a further increase, bringing the total increase to £102,873.  If we can afford to increase the charge in one department of the service to such an amount, surely it should not be out of our power to increase the charge for such a very desirable purpose as is proposed by the Bill?  As I said a moment ago when speaking Irish, these old people are practically the last heritage we have.  In my part of the country they are the last of the Gaels.  They are dying out fast, and the least we can do is to make their passing away as peaceful as we can, even at some sacrifice or extra cost to the State.  It would be money well spent.  It would be a terrible thing to leave these people in the condition that they have to go into what are still called workhouses.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to remove the stigma of pauperism, but I am afraid the people who go into these institutions are still classed as paupers.  We force them into the poorhouses all over the country, and when we get them in we deprive them of the little sum that the State <Col N="1939" /> gave them to remove the stigma of pauperism.  Then when they come out they have again to go through the long process of endeavouring to get the pensions restored.  It is all very well to say that these old people should make application a month before they leave the county homes, but they never dream of doing that, they are not so cute, and they make no effort to get the pensions restored to them until they come out and find that they are gone. Somehow we appear to make things as hard as we possibly can for them. Old people are very easily confused. When a pensions officer goes to them they sometimes give him hopelessly misleading information that leads him to believe that their means are far greater than they actually are, because they are incapable of giving a correct account of their position. Anything that we can do to make their position easier we should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  It does not propose anything revolutionary.  It does not propose any startling change.  All that it proposes to do is to go back to the conditions that prevailed before 1924. The Minister said a good deal about the amount of old age pensions paid in County Mayo.  I think the best answer to that is an Act that recently went through the House&mdash; the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  There is a clause in that which states that grants under the Act will be given to people with poor law valuations under 21/-, and in that Act there are about sixty scheduled areas in the County Mayo.  I wonder if the Minister realises that the total poor law valuation of the whole union of Belmullet, almost a quarter of the County Mayo, is less than £12,000. Under the reforms that this Bill proposes in the present law a poor county like Mayo would be especially benefited.  Anybody who has any knowledge of conditions in rural Ireland, particularly in the West, knows that with the usual economic position of the small farmer, no matter how large the family, there is only one son for the land and, if possible, one <Col N="1940" /> daughter to be married at home, and that often depends on the people being able to make successful family arrangements.  The old people are forced, through those economic conditions, to sign over their holdings, and all right to their holdings, to the son who is going to get married.  Due to these circumstances, over which they have no control, they are at present penalised by the Act of 1924. If, as Deputy Ward has pointed out, they do not make such an assignment three full years before they make an application for the old age pension, if they happen by accident not to make it until two years and eleven months before applying, they are deprived for ever of all chance of getting an old age pension.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>I would appeal, as Deputy Corry has appealed, to all Deputies representing rural constituencies, and especially Deputies who know the conditions that exist in the West, to support this Bill, and to remove the provision in the law which hits people living in the rural districts. We do not want to make any party capital out of this Bill; all we want is to remedy the injustice perpetrated by the Act of 1924, and, considering that we have heard so many speeches about unity, about doing away with partition and the desirability of making Ireland one, it is certainly a poor encouragement to the people across the border to do so when they contrast the conditions under which they live and the privileges to which they are entitled there under their Old Age Pensions Acts with the conditions here.  It is certainly no inducement to them to desire unity with us, to desire that the Border should be abolished.  As has been pointed out, the clause in the existing law affects a person because, through poverty and illness, he is forced to enter a county hospital and spend three months there, thereby losing his pension, and perhaps after leaving that institution, after a long and painful illness.  When he is trying to recuperate, he finds that he has lost his pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a Question to-day to the Minister for Justice asking him</P>
      <P>If he is aware that on some ten occasions recently the offices of the Irish Labour Defence League, situated in the Engineers' Hall, 6 Gardiner's Row, Dublin, have been raided, under the Firearms Act, by detective officers of the Gárda Síochána; that this organisation has as its object the raising of funds to provide legal assistance to working men and women who may be charged, or even arrested without charge, during the course of economic struggles to prevent wages being lowered, or other such objects; that the organisation also undertakes the succour of the innocent dependents of such workers; and if he will state whether in any one of these raids there has been found any sign of firearms of any description, and whether he will undertake to instruct his Department to put an end to this activity on the part of the detective officers.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>The offices in question have been frequented by a group of persons who are known to be active members of an organisation which has for its object the overthrow, by armed force, of the existing State. So long as these people continue to frequent the premises, the premises will be searched for firearms at frequent intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to inform the Minister that the Irish Labour Defence League, as stated in the Question, has rented offices at No. 6, Gardiner's Row.  As to who occupies other offices in these premises I am not in a position to state.  The question dealt specifically with the offices rented and occupied by the Irish Labour Defence League, and for the information <Col N="1942" /> of the Minister and those concerned, I will state the aims and objects of the organisation.  The Irish Labour Defence League's aims and objects are set out in its constitution, a printed copy of which I can supply to the Minister if he desires. I will read some of its aims and objects.</P>
    <P>The Irish Labour Defence League is a non-party organisation, serving exclusively the interests of the workers and oppressed peoples in their struggle against the Imperialist régime. The Irish Labour Defence League takes upon itself the following obligations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To initiate and centralise campaigns for the release of all Political and Class War prisoners, the repeal of anti-labour laws, against anti-labour legislation, against persecution of Unions and strikers, for freedom of speech and assembly, the right of asylum, and to publicly expose the brutal treatment of Political and Class War Prisoners.</P>
    <P>(2)  To provide legal defence for all who are persecuted for anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist activities.</P>
    <P>(3)  To provide material and moral support for Political and Class War Prisoners, as defined in paragraph (a), and support for their families and dependents.</P>
    <P>(4)  To organise widespread campaigns against persecution in this and other capitalist, colonial and semi-colonial countries, and to give moral and financial aid wherever possible to the victims of such persecution.</P>
    <P>(5)  To publish Press information, pamphlets, etc., dealing with the above customs.</P>
    <P>Article Three&mdash;Organisational Principles.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principles of the Irish Labour Defence League are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> (1)  The election of all official committees of the organisation (national, district and local) by meetings of the members, conferences and congresses.</P>
    <P>I desire to ask the Minister if, in his opinion, the objects which I have read out are in any way contrary to or inimical to the interests of the State.  If so, some justification may be found for the activities of the C.I.D. in raiding these offices at frequent intervals.  But I submit that this organisation is an open organisation, composed of working men and women operating in the interests of the working classes in this country.  I also want to ask the Minister is it his policy, or the policy of his Department, to initiate a campaign of tyranny and victimisation against those who are prominent in the Irish Labour movement, because they may not have as yet given faith of their loyalty to the political régime in this country.  I submit that there cannot possibly be any other excuse, or any other cause put forward for this reign of tyranny which has been carried on for some time past, particularly against this organisation.  This organisation represents the vanguard of Irish Labour, and I think it is time we had a declaration from the Minister as to whether he is including in the category of criminals those who stand for the principles of Irish Labour.  The Minister was told on a previous occasion that it is only reasonable to assume that he is a mere cipher in this matter, that he is placed here as Minister for Justice nominally, but that in reality he has no more to say in the conduct of his Department than I have, who, fortunately, am not associated in any way with any department of State as at present constituted.  Is it a fact that there is behind the Minister an ex-British official, an ex-British civil servant who might be termed a key man in the Department of Justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have yet to learn whether he is the evil genius or not. We heard a lot about tyranny in that and in other countries, but these are far away.  We are dealing now with the question which affects the home position, and I want the Minister for a few moments to depart from his parrot-like reply formula, and tell us exactly what his Department really aims at in their operations against this particular organisation.  As I said, these offices are rented and occupied by a particular organisation whose aims and objects I have read out, the membership of which can be vouched for as being composed of Irish workers, men and women.  Their political beliefs do not enter into the question at all.  They meet there as Irish workers to deal with questions affecting Irish workers, and questions of political propaganda in any shape or form, I am reliably informed, are not dealt with, except <Col N="1945" /> in so far as they affect membership of this organisation as workers.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Irish Labour movement is to a great extent political. Political questions of a certain nature must of necessity arise, but there are no underhand methods, no secret meetings, no oaths being administered, no arms being carried by the members there.  They are meeting there as members of an open organisation and they have declared their aims and objects here, publicly in a written constitution.  Will the Minister say that this constitution is illegal?  If so, as I have said, we will know where we stand, but otherwise I think it is up to him to withdraw his C.I.D. forces from operating in this manner.  One of the consequences of these frequent raids has been that young men, ardent enthusiastic members of this organisation who are employed in certain firms in the city, have been arrested, taken to the Bridewell and kept there for hours, sometimes over-night without any charge being preferred against them.  They have been unable to turn into work at the hour specified by their employers on the following morning.  As a result some of them have lost their employment and are now walking the streets.  Is that the policy of the Minister's Department? Is it his desire to drive these people out of the country because they are known to be prominent in the Irish Labour movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has told us that the premises are frequented by persons who are known to be members of an organisation which has, as its object, the overthrow, by armed force, of the existing State.  On a question raised here, I think, yesterday afternoon, the Minister was pressed to explain why, if he knew of certain individuals or his Department knew of certain individuals who were known to be actively engaged in such a conspiracy he does not have those persons arrested and tried by the ordinary court methods which he is so ready to recommend to us when we raise questions here of grievances of certain people.  He tells us that they should try the ordinary court <Col N="1946" /> methods.  Why does he not try the ordinary court methods in respect of those persons who are known to be actively engaged in an effort to overthrow this State by force of arms? Why are those people allowed to frequent these premises night after night?  I submit it is mere eye wash. It has gone on so long and we have heard the same answer so often to questions dealing with this matter that no one in his senses will seriously consider for a moment that the Minister is in any way addressing himself to the real question.</P>
    <P>There is something sinister behind it all, and I want to warn the Minister that he is flirting with a serious situation if he allows this conduct to continue.  He has said here to-night that he is responsible for the activities of all those who are operating under his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald - Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald - Kenney">

I want to ask him to beware of the consequences which must inevitably follow a continuation of this policy of repression of people who are claiming nothing more or less than the rights of ordinary citizens, the rights which are laid down and guaranteed in the Constitution which the Minister claims to be the guardian and custodian of, the right of free speech and the right of assembly. Does the Minister deny that Irish workers have those rights?  Those are all we ask for them.  Out of those ten raids I submit that not one scintilla of evidence has been found in support of the contention that this organisation is composed of people who are actively engaged in any conspiracy other than the open conspiracy as laid down in their constitution. If that is a conspiracy I congratulate them, and hope that they will continue to conspire and further the aims and objects of that organisation as laid down in the constitution.  In this I am giving the Minister fifty-fifty, so he will get fifteen minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked, and I was asked last night in a similiar fashion by Deputy Hogan, why are prosecutions not brought?  I was anxious to answer Deputy Hogan then but I expected the matter would come up on the adjournment.  I am glad that same question has been put to me now.  These men are engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the State. In order that you should  those men of being engaged in that conspiracy it is necessary to get a <Col N="1948" /> conviction in law.  It is necessary that they should have done certain overt acts in the pursuance of their conspiracy.  The attitude I have taken up, and I impress upon the Deputy that it is my attitude, and which I purpose adhering to is this: to see that members of that conspiracy shall not be allowed to commit overt acts of violence.  I have stated in this House before and I state it to this House again to-night that in my opinion the primary duty of the Guards and the Government is to see that acts of violence are not committed. Our duty is not merely to convict persons who have committed offences.  We know that there are persons who have banded themselves together.  The Deputy knows it. Everybody in the country knows it. Everyone knows that there is an association calling themselves the I.R.A. which is pledged to overthrow this existing Constitution and State by force of arms.  There is nobody so ignorant in the country who does not know that.</P>
      <P>Are those persons to be allowed to commit open acts of violence before they are prosecuted?  That is really what Deputy Hogan and Deputy Cooney ask.  Let those people commit acts of violence and then prosecute them.  When someone has been murdered then track down the criminal.  My answer to that is this: that we are going to see that the rights and the property of citizens in this State are preserved.</P>

      <P>I was replying to a question which I had not an opportunity to answer, but Deputy Hogan and I will discuss that matter again.  I will leave out Deputy Hogan and confine myself to Deputy Cooney, who has put his case.  Does Deputy Cooney then think that the proper course to be adopted is this: that open acts of violence are to be committed and then only are the Guards to come in, or is it their duty to see that no body in this country <Col N="1949" /> who is not by law entitled to carry arms shall carry arms?  What do those people want to carry arms for except to commit crimes of violence? He says that no arms have been found in this particular building.

Here is a place frequented almost nightly by those persons who have sworn themselves, as the Deputy and everybody else in the House knows, into an organisation to upset this State by force.  Where is it more likely that those persons will deposit their arms than in this particular building that they have free access to?</P>

      <P>He is one; there are others who are members of this association, and it is because this association has these persons in it that the association rooms are being searched.  I do not know whether the Deputy is a member of this association or not himself.  I do not know, but if he has any influence with this association, and if this association is the quiet, peaceable body he makes it out to be let them show it.  Let them drum out the gunmen.  Let them say that anybody who is going to use physical violence against this State must cease to be a member of that association. Let them show that they are genuine in that.  The Deputy may have a case if that were done, that it was wrong and improper to search their premises, but as long as they welcome to their ranks and put on their committees persons who, we know, are engaged in endeavouring by force to upset this State, so long must they take the punishment which follows from associating with persons of that class on friendly terms, and making persons of that class their friends, associates and fellow-members.  They cannot have it both ways.  The Deputy wants us to believe that this is a perfectly peaceable organisation that will never resort to violence or force. <Col N="1951" /> Then why does he not put the persons who openly preach force out of it?</P>

      <P>I do not know what happens inside the walls of that particular room, but the room is frequented by persons who do preach the doctrine of physical force, and the real question at issue here is: is that the sort of place in which the Guards will find arms?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that an open, constitutional organisation like this should examine the bona fides of every applicant for membership to this particular organisation, which lays it down in its constitution that it is open to any member of the Irish working classes, irrespective of his or her political views?  Is it possible or reasonable that the Minister should recommend or suggest that the responsible officers of this organisation should examine the political views and aspirations of every applicant for membership?  Is that a reasonable suggestion to put up?</P>

      <P>I do not know that Mr. MacBride, Mr. Coulter or Mr. Price are what one would ordinarily call working men.  I should not have thought so at all.  I would not have thought that a journalist, the editor of a certain paper, is what one would usually call a working man.</P>

      <P>As members of that organisation they become working men!  You need not be a working man to join the organisation, but as soon as you join the organisation, by joining you become a working man!  My idea is that a working man is a man who works. I am sorry that I cannot pursue this interesting dialogue any further.  I would like to congratulate the Deputy upon his courage.  On the last night that we had a debate here on the adjournment, the Deputy, who raised a question as soon as he had made his speech, put his tail between his legs and scurried out of the House as quickly as he could.  I am glad to say that I see in Deputy Cooney a great deal more courage than I saw in the other Deputy. Evidently the North has more backbone than certain persons who come from Cork.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in view of the fact that this type of question is brought up on the adjournment many times in the course of the year, and in view of this long-drawn-out campaign would the Minister seriously consider the question of taking powers to exclude or banish, for perhaps a few years, from our State those few young gentlemen who are wasting our time and the time of the House by their operations?</P>
