      <P>Reference was made yesterday to the cost of introducing the telephone service into country districts, and special reference was made by Deputy George Wolfe to the district of Kildangan.  I know of three cases in that district in which three gentlemen are anxious to get a telephone service.  One or two of them have already consented to take it in.  The cost in two cases is over £18, and in the third case it is £24.  I think those costs are altogether excessive, considering that the district is within forty miles of the City of Dublin.  If these costs could be lowered I would say that possibly a great many additional people would be induced to avail of the telephone service.  The present charges are certainly abnormal.  They are excessive, and I think attention should be given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the question of giving better service and better terms in country districts, so as to induce numbers of people who are not now availing of the telephone service to do so.  This could be helped by lowering the costs of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary speaks about the postal service in this country paying its way, I contend that that sort of economy which is sought to be brought about in this country is harmful.  In the old days we had two postal deliveries daily in the villages in the rural parts of Ireland, <Col N="2054" /> and these services have now been taken away or considerably reduced. I know of one particular district where we had the morning post about 8 o'clock and a mid-day delivery about one.  Now there is only one delivery in that village, and that does not arrive sooner than 12.20.  If the postal service cannot be made to pay except by depriving the rural people and rural areas of a decent service, then I contend that that is false economy, and that matters of that sort should be taken into consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to emphasise the point made by Deputy Buckley.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to justify the telephone charges in the country districts.  Up to within one mile of the Telephone Exchange the charge is £5.  That £5 must cover the upkeep of the wire as well as the upkeep of the instruments and the charges at the station. Over one mile there is a charge of £1 per furlong made, so that a person living two miles from the office would have to pay £13 a year. If the £5 in the first case covers the upkeep of the wire and the other charges, then the upkeep of the wire must be very much less than £1 per station?  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to see an extension of the telephone service, why should he penalise people who happen to live outside the mile radius of the station?  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to extend the service, why does he not encourage such people to get in the telephone?  If he would encourage people to get in the telephone in country districts, it would mean that the whole overhead charges would be reduced, and that he would have a better chance of making the service pay, while at the same time giving a good service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Doyle raise the question of the disadvantages under which rural areas suffer.  However, in the cases that he mentioned I do not agree that there is much of a disability. If they have one post per day in a <Col N="2055" /> rural area they have not so much to complain of, and the Deputy said they had two.  They are very well off, indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say they have two.  They have only one delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If a rural area has one delivery the people there ought to be very well satisfied.  They are well off compared with areas that I know in which they have only three services in the week.  In one country area that I know of where this system of three services in the week obtains, when a holiday comes along it frequently happens that there is only one service in five days.  That district is not very far from a town. I do not want to criticise the Minister's desire for economy.  I fully appreciate that that is the Minister's particular rôle in this House.  I do not know that he has achieved much, but that is his rôle, anyway.  I will not criticise him very much for that.</P>
      <P>We have often in this House pressed for economies of various kinds, but there is such a thing as economy gone mad and I think that applies to this particular rural area that I have in mind.  I know there are very many other places similarly affected.  I could cite several cases, but I know this one particularly well.  It certainly is not good enough, even though it might be considered economy, to deprive people of a proper delivery of letters and give them only one delivery every five days, as sometimes happens. Perhaps if I put the particulars before the Parliamentary Secretary, he might be able to make some adjustment and give back to those people some of the rights they had some years ago. Everybody in the House will agree that in a district not very remote from a town three posts a week, and frequently only one post in five days, is not giving adequate service in view of what the taxpayer pays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. Broderick Mr. H. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw <Col N="2056" /> the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that the Post Office in Athlone is entirely inadequate to cope with the volume of business usually transacted there. The accommodation at the present time is really very limited.  All the business has to be transacted at the one counter and the inconvenience will be better realised when I mention that at that one counter people hand in telegrams, make arrangements for telephone calls, purchase stamps, postal and money orders and deal in all the other business associated with Post Office work.  I might mention that over the same counter owners of dogs take out dog licences.  It will be observed that in the circumstances there is very limited convenience for the public.  As a matter of fact people are frequently huddled together in the office.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate this matter and see if it would not be possible to find a more suitable building which would give the required accommodation to the people in that very important town. It would be well if a larger building could be procured so that the people would not be obliged to transact Post Office business so inconveniently as at present.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows very well that there is plenty of State property in and around Athlone in which a new office could be established.  I hope that he will give this matter his very serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get a promise from the Parliamentary Secretary of some definite date when he would be in a position to give an extended telephone service to that large, densely-populated area of Rathmines and Rathgar. Large numbers of persons have made applications for the telephone, but their applications could not be acceded to because the existing facilities were not sufficient to cope with any extension.  Some considerable time has elapsed since a promise was given that additional facilities would be afforded.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give <Col N="2057" /> some definite promise to the people interested as to when they may hope to get those facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the plea made on behalf of the rural districts for an increase in postal deliveries. I have been in communication with the Parliamentary Secretary about a district within a few miles from my place where they have only two deliveries each week. The Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to go into the matter with me, but as the grievance is a general one I think that the time has come when economies in the direction of a few deliveries each week could be somewhat modified, and if a little extra service was given it would be of benefit to the people.  It is very inconvenient to have only two deliveries each week.  I think that in the district I refer to&mdash;Rosenallis, Clonaslee, near Mountmellick&mdash;one additional delivery per week might well be added.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that affects country people very much and that is the porterage charge on telegrams.  At the moment there is a charge of two shillings for the delivery of a telegram a distance of three miles from the Post Office. That is very excessive, and I think something should be done to reduce that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate Deputy Lemass asked some questions with regard to facilities being provided by the Post Office in certain directions.  He suggested with regard to the use of the air mail that the public should be made aware of the facilities which are available.  In the Post Office Guide will be found all information with regard to the air mail, but in addition to that, it is intended to issue leaflets at the various Post Offices. That will be done in a short time, I hope.  Dealing with the general question of the Post Office loss, Deputy Lemass made certain suggestions in the direction of finding out how the losses might be remedied or might be reduced.  Amongst other things, he suggested that the postage <Col N="2058" /> on newspapers might be increased. Needless to say, the various aspects of the loss on the Post Office have received very careful and serious examination and all possibilities which might lead in the direction of reducing that loss have been given consideration.</P>
      <P>But with regard to the particular item he mentions, the newspaper services, it is considered that there would be certain disadvantages in increasing the charges.  It might not result in any financial benefit to the Post Office at all.  One of the reasons, as pointed out in my general statement, is that the apportionment of the costs of the various sections of the Postal Service is to a certain extent artificial.  From a book-keeping point of view it is perfectly accurate, but it must be recognised as a book-keeping apportionment. The various sections of the Postal Services hang together to an extent, and although you may find one particular section of the service is losing, the actual abolition of the service or increase in charge of that service is not necessarily going to make it pay. An abolition of a certain section of the service is not going to reduce other requirements in a proportion equal to the cost of the particular service.  When a postman goes out to deliver his letters, for instance, he may be carrying at the same time twopenny letters and cheaper postal matter.  Taking from that postman the delivery of the cheaper postal matter is not going to reduce the time spent on his route to any appreciable extent. That is one of the reasons why, as I stated in my general statement, that the acceptance of the obvious inferences from the apportionment of the cost of the various sections of the Postal Service is likely to be misleading.  The services are to be taken as a whole and judged as a whole.  It is a rather complex question. It is difficult offhand to give an explanation which may be easily understood, but it is an aspect which has been given very careful consideration in this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> There is also another aspect of that particular section, and it is this: Under the Postal Convention regulations we are obliged to deliver postal matter, coming from whatever source, without making any charge to the posting country.  If we were to increase the postal rates on our newspapers the result might easily be that we would protect, say, those newspapers coming in from an outside country.  That is to say, the postal rates from outside would be lower than the postal rates in this country. I think Deputies will agree with me that that is an undesirable thing to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is also anxious to know what are the benefits resulting from the attachment of letter-boxes to buses.  There are various benefits, and they vary in different cases in regard to different localities. One of the benefits which would result would be this, that the buses would pass through these various country towns at a later time than the ordinary collection of postal matter to be sent in an ordinary way by the mail trains.  Sometimes the buses might be several hours later; that would enable people to post letters at a time later than the ordinary posting time, and enable them to connect with mails in Dublin with which they would not ordinarily connect.  For instance, they might get a connection with Dublin which should allow a letter posted at a later hour than usual in the country districts to be delivered in Dublin that evening, or it might give them a connection with the cross-Channel mail that night or with the various mails going to other parts of the country that night.  That is one of the advantages which would accrue from post-boxes being attached to the buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary state if a letter posted in one of those boxes attached to an omnibus arrived in Dublin at 12 o'clock in the day would it be delivered in Dublin in the afternoon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the <Col N="2060" /> exact details as to the hours, but in certain cases letters posted on the buses would be delivered in Dublin that day which ordinarily would not be delivered.  That is as near to it as I can get at the moment.  It has other advantages.  The buses pass along through little hamlets and villages where there are no pillar boxes or post offices and people can take advantage of the buses to post their letters.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extra charge, it is felt that we are giving a special facility to the people in this case which would cost us something additional and that we might reasonably make an extra charge.  As I pointed out, so far it is experimental, and even the question of charge must be regarded as experimental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also dealt with the question of telephone charges, and, if I understand him properly, his contention was that by increasing the telephone charge we might make the telephone service a self-supporting service.  That is quite possible.  It is quite possible, if we increased the charge by a small amount, that the increased revenue would make the telephone service self-supporting in a quicker time than it would ordinarily become.  I do not wish to be understood as saying that I do not think the telephone service will become self-supporting.  I think it will, but the rate of progress in that direction is slow, and the reason is because our charges have been brought down to as low a point as possible.  In fact, we are almost inclined to think that they are being brought slightly too low, but at any rate we are slowly going in the direction of making the service a self-supporting one.  We wish to have it an expanding service.  It is of great value to the public, and is a service which we think it is in the interests of the general development of the country to expand.  We think it we were to increase the charge we might possibly check the extension, and for that reason we believe it would be unwise to increase the charges at the present juncture. We hope that eventually the telephone <Col N="2061" /> service will pay for itself, or come very close to paying for itself.</P>
    <P>The general principle that an increase in the number of subscribers does not bring about a reduction in the costs is applicable to the telephone service all over the world and as I stated that the advantages which the public gain by an increase in the use of telephones is not the expectation of a lower charge but the greater communication facilities which are placed at the disposal of the various people who use the telephone. Various Deputies referred to the situation existing in Rathmines and pointed out the necessity for making an effort to meet the congestion which exists in regard to telephone facilities.  Rathmines and Terenure area happens to be practically the only area in Ireland where the telephone facilities available for the people do not equal the demand. There is also a slight congestion in one or two other places, but that is the principal place.  There has been some considerable delay in regard to Rathmines.  We had in mind the intention of getting a site for a Post Office and Telephone Exchange in Rathmines.  Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting a suitable site.  When the Post Office are looking for a site in Rathmines or any other place land immediately acquires a gold mine value.  People want exorbitant prices.  The Post Office did not wish to rush in and buy at an exorbitant price.  There was some delay in getting a site.  We have now the site and the plans are ready for erecting the building but that will take some time.  We felt that in the intervening period it was not right that such a large number of people should be on the waiting list in Rathmines and we have made arrangements for a temporary relief exchange to be erected in the neighbourhood of the proposed site. That will relieve, to a considerable extent, the congestion.  I might point out that the congestion is due to a certain extent to other factors. There has been considerable and rapid growth in the population of that area, and the population happens to be the kind of people who <Col N="2062" /> are in a financial position to instal telephones.  The demand for telephones in the area is greater in proportion to the number of the population than in most other districts. We recognise, however, that there is a distinct obligation on us to meet the requirements at the earliest possible date and we are working in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also entered into the question of increased telegraph charges and the saving that resulted from them.  I do not intend to enter into a very close analysis of the situation in that connection because I dealt with it fully last year.  I would like to point out to Deputy Lemass that simply taking the saving which is effected this year as compared with last year in the telegraph services does not give us a true appreciation of the full saving which was effected by the increased charge.  Various other factors have to be taken into account, some of them not very tangible, and it is difficult to arrive at exact figures.  There is no doubt that the increased charges have diverted a certain amount of custom to the trunk and ordinary telephones.  The Department has estimated what the amount of the diversion is and it is fairly considerable.  There are other factors also in connection with the charge.  There was a continual lessening of the number of telegrams being sent even before this increased charge was imposed.  If that lessening went on at the rate at which it had been going on the loss which would eventually result would be greater than the loss which actually existed at the time the change was made.  We want to have comparative figures.  We have got to compare the loss now with the loss which would have resulted by this time if the decrease in the number of telegrams went on at the previous rate and at previous rate of charge.  So that there are three factors to be taken into account in computing the saving brought about by the increased charge.  Generally, we are quite satisfied that the increased charge has resulted in a definite saving. <Col N="2063" /> While we can only give approximate figures, we are fairly certain that the increased charge has resulted in a saving to the Post Office Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also wanted to get information as to the censorship of correspondence in the Post Office.  I want to make it quite clear that so far as the Post Office Department is concerned no censorship of any kind takes place.  Any censorship that does take place is by warrant of the Department of Justice.  If the post office have to hold up mails passing through they can only do so on a warrant from the Department of Justice, and the matter should really be discussed on the Vote for the Department of Justice and not on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I might say, so far as I can ascertain, the number of letters which have been held up for examination is comparatively trifling.  There is no such thing in existence as a black list and there is no such thing as a permanent list handed to the Post Office of persons whose correspondence has to be stopped.  There is nothing in the nature of political censorship at all.  Certainly no letters addressed to any Deputy in this House have been held up.  I can definitely state that.  No matter of any kind addressed to Deputies sitting in this House has been held up by the Post Office on the warrant of the Department of Justice.  I might point out to Deputy Lemass that, so far as interference with postal matters is concerned, the Post Office here interferes to a lesser extent than almost any postal administration in the world.  The Deputy himself has been advising that very stringent action should be taken in regard to holding up matter of an objectionable nature of another description, matter which comes under the Censorship Act.  Doubtless when that Act comes into full operation the postal department will be called upon to interfere to a greater extent with matter passing through the post than it has done up to the present. In any case, I might repeat definitely that the amount of interference <Col N="2064" /> has been comparatively slight and always on a warrant issued by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also dealt with a matter which he brought to my attention personally.  It is that part-time postmen should be allowed to engage in insurance work in addition to their ordinary postal work. Canvassing for insurance by part-time or auxiliary postmen is prohibited. The matter was brought to my notice recently, and after careful consideration it was decided that it would be inadvisable to sanction canvassing for insurance. The reason for that is fairly obvious.  We feel that there is no regulation that we could make that would obviate the possibility of part-time postmen canvassing if they were free to do insurance work whilst they were engaged on their postal work.  We think it is inadvisable that postmen should combine work of delivering letters with canvassing for insurance, and I think if the Deputy would consider it from that point of view he would realise that the prohibition is justified. We feel that there is no regulation that we would make which would prevent part-time postmen canvassing for insurance during the hours in which they are supposed to be delivering letters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware, so far as these auxiliary or part-time postmen are concerned, that some of them have only 15/-, 16/- or 17/- a week? Surely the Department does not consider that that is a sufficient wage for a married man to keep his wife and family on.  Seeing that the rate of wages is so low and that these men are not allowed to take part in insurance work, is the Department prepared to give consideration to the question of increasing these men's remuneration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware, of course, that the work is only part-time and that these men are allowed to engage in almost any other reasonable activity, but as it so happens insurance work is one of the few things <Col N="2065" /> that are prohibited for the reasons which I gave.  The question of the wages of part-time postmen is another matter, and it can be dealt with apart from this particular aspect of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish suggested an addition of 6d. in the charge on foreign parcels to discourage the import of foreign goods.  As the Deputy is aware there is at present a delivery charge of sixpence in regard to foreign parcels and, in addition, if the contents of the parcel are of a dutiable nature there is a minimum customs charge.  We feel it would not be advisable to add to the delivery charge at the present time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little dealt with the question of the up-grading of the staff in the Waterford office.  That question has been under consideration for a number of years.  The staffs in the various cities and towns are graded into three classes.  Dublin is in class 1 Blackrock and some other towns are in class II.  Waterford and Clonmel happen to be in class 3.  An application was made to have this question reconsidered.  It was decided that the request of the Waterford staff could not be conceded.  The decision is really one for the Department of Finance and not for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  As a definite decision was taken on the question during the past year, I feel that no useful purpose would be served in re-opening it again.  The various factors that enter into the question are too complicated to discuss in the course of a debate of this nature, but if the Deputies representing Waterford are sufficiently interested I can discuss the matter personally with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy George Wolfe and other Deputies dealt with the question of the cost of installing telephones in rural districts.  I think that a good many Deputies misunderstand the position in regard to the cost of this work.  The general policy of the Department in regard to applications for telephone connections in rural areas is this: that the charge made shall be such as to recompense the Department for the annual cost <Col N="2066" /> which results from the establishment of the telephone.  If a person who applies for the installation of a telephone in his home resides three or four miles from the nearest Post Office Exchange, and if poles and wires have to be erected to his residence, the charge is bound to be very high, unless Deputies are prepared to assert that people in such a situation should be subsidised to a very considerable extent.  The charge in some of these cases may amount to as much as £20 or more.  The charge is dependent upon the position of the applicant's home.  It is such as barely to recompense the Post Office for the annual cost resulting from the erection of the poles and wires and the other necessary apparatus with operation charges.  If it were possible to get a number of subscribers in a rural area, then the total charge of erecting the poles and wires and doing the other necessary work could be divided amongst them, and the cost would not come so heavy on a particular individual.</P>
    <P>The Post Office can scarcely be held responsible for the fact that people applying for telephone installations happen to reside in isolated rural areas, very far away from the nearest Post Office exchange.  We are prepared to provide cheaper facilities where we can get a number of people living in a certain area to join together and have a rural party line.  The cost of a rural party line works out a good deal cheaper than the cost of a telephone installation for individual use.  Of course, there are certain disadvantages in the case of a party line, though it is very much cheaper than the other system. People do not seem to take very much interest in this party line scheme.  There is no evidence of any development in that direction on the part of the people in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary explain why the charge in the case of telephone installations is 12s. per furlong up to a mile and £1 per furlong over a mile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy <Col N="2067" /> misunderstands the position in regard to the charges.  The Deputy is now dealing with charges made in the case of cities and larger towns where a considerable number of subscribers are available.  In such cases the ordinary telephone charges are £6 10s. per year for a business line, and £5 per year in the case of a private residence line, with a charge of so much per furlong over a mile. That is the charge that prevails in Dublin as well as in large and in moderate-sized towns.  When we come to deal with the rural exchanges, where you may have one, two or three subscribers, we have to deal with them in a different way. Generally speaking, the method adopted is to make a charge proportionate to the cost of the installation. There is no fixed rate of charge.  I take it that what the Deputy has in mind are the cities and the larger towns where we can get a considerable number of subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Department for Posts and Telegraphs have refused facilities for the affixing of telephone wires to the poles used for carrying the electricity lines?  As the Parliamentary Secretary is, no doubt, aware there are a good many persons living adjacent to towns that have the electricity supply who have had electricity carried to their homes on poles for the erection of which they have had to pay themselves.  When they wished to get the telephone installed in their homes they desired to economise by using the electricity poles for the carrying of the telephone wire.  I understand that the Department has refused to facilitate them in that.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary state the reason for the refusal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no definite information on the point raised by the Deputy, but, as far as I am aware the policy of the Department is to have telephone lines erected by the Department itself.  Possibly there would be a technical difficulty in carrying out what the Deputy suggests might be done.  If the telephone <Col N="2068" /> wires were carried on the electricity poles it might be found that the telephone messages would not be carried satisfactorily.  There would possibly be a certain amount of induction from the high tension wires of the electricity system which would make it difficult, if not impossible, to have the telephone wires carried on the same poles as the electricity wires.  However, that is a technical point upon which I have no information at the moment.  I am not quite sure what the reason is, as a specific instance of this has never come before me.  If the Deputy will give me a specific instance I will examine into it and let him know the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question that I put to the Parliamentary Secretary I want to know from him if he realises the situation himself. As far as I know, the situation is this: that for distances up to one mile people are charged £5 per year for the telephone service, and that over a mile there is a charge of an additional £1 per furlong.  That means that up to a mile people are paying at the rate of 12/- per furlong, and over a mile they are paying at the rate of £1 per furlong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to point out to the Deputy that the charges that he has quoted are only applicable to certain areas, principally the cities and the larger towns. These charges are not applicable to rural areas where you have small exchanges. The charges for the smaller places are made on a different basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the cities and the larger towns the charge is £6 10s. per year within a mile radius.  There is an increased charge per furlong outside the mile radius.  These are the existing charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not think it is.  Deputy Moore dealt with the publication of commercial accounts, and he wanted to know why they could not be published sooner than they are at present.  They are published as quickly as possible after the end of the financial year.  It usually takes about five months before the commercial accounts are completed.  Calculations have to be made with regard to international traffic, and adjustments made with various countries, and that usually occupies a period of about five months.  The financial year of the Post Office ends in April, and they are usually completed about September.  They are then handed over to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the cost of their publication has to be sanctioned by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to the Savings Bank.  He was anxious to know what efforts had been made by this Department to get back the money of Irish depositors deposited in the English Savings Bank.  After the setting up of this State, efforts were made to get the Irish depositors to withdraw their deposits from the English Savings Bank and put them into the Irish Savings Bank, and to a certain extent they were successful.  Notices as to the advisability of transferring the deposits to the Irish Savings Bank were displayed in the Post Offices. It is quite probable that a large amount of money invested by Irish depositors in the English Post Office has been returned to the Irish Savings Bank.  It may not be known to Deputies that the Post Office Savings Bank does not act as an agency for depositors in the English Bank&mdash;that is, deposits cannot be made through the Irish Post Office, <Col N="2070" /> but withdrawals can be made, the result being continuous withdrawals from the English Savings Bank and increased deposits in the Irish Savings Bank.  The actual figures with regard to the Savings Bank may be of some interest.  During the year 1929 the number of deposits was 504,782; the amount of the deposits £1,100,626; average amount of deposits, £2 3s. 7d.: number of withdrawals, 212,985; amount of withdrawals £1,116,018; average amount of withdrawals, £5 4s. 10d.  Amounts standing to the credit of all open accounts at the close of the year were £3,163,379 as compared with £3,103,771, that is an increase in the number of deposits.  The average amount standing to the credit of each open account is £16 15s. 9d.  I might mention that to a certain extent the Savings Bank is affected by the propaganda in connection with the Savings Certificates.  Money that would ordinarily go into the Savings Bank is going into the Savings Certificates, for which a larger rate of interest is allowed.  Deputy Wolfe raised the question of Savings Bank cheques, which he also raised last year.  That matter has received consideration by the Department, and it was felt that a system of cheques could not be usefully employed.  We believe it is employed in one or two of the Continental administrations, but we believe the conditions here are such that they would not lend themselves to this form of banking. Deputy Buckley dealt with the cost of telephones in the country districts. I have dealt with that question already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalBuckley" hpid="Mr. Buckley Mr. Buckley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Buckley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point raised by Deputy Aiken is involved in that&mdash;that is, the charge of 12s. a furlong under a mile and £1 a furlong over a mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Aiken, that is a matter I cannot deal with at the moment, but I am prepared to let the Deputies know later.  Deputy Doyle and other Deputies dealt with the curtailment of postal services.  Deputy Wolfe referred to a particular area.  There <Col N="2071" /> has been no curtailment of postal services recently and the services are being continued as they were. The general policy of the Department is not to increase the present postal facilities in rural districts only in exceptional cases and where special reasons can be shown, such as that there has been a considerable increase in population in a district or industrial development in an area. It might be pointed out that the postal facilities rendered here are probably more extensive than in a great many other countries.  They are certainly more extensive than in countries similarly situated.  It so happens that we reaped the advantage of association with a closely-populated industrial country in regard to postal deliveries.  If we were to give greater facilities in isolated districts we could do so only by an additional loss to the Department or, in other words, by subsidising the increased service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so to a certain extent, but the policy of the Department is to get away as quickly as possible from that and place the Post Office on a self-supporting basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it just that while the whole Department is to a certain extent subsidised the rural community should get no benefit from that and that the others get all the benefit?  Is that the principle he is working on?  Apparently it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  As a matter of fact it is the rural areas which are subsidised at the moment.  Services to the rural areas are the services which are run at a loss.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe <Col N="2072" /> raised a question with regard to Kildangan. Consideration has been given to the matter he referred to. A deputation was received by the Department in connection with it, and I personally saw one or two persons particularly interested.  We gave certain concessions, but we did not feel that the situation had changed so as to warrant giving the increased postal facilities asked for. The Deputy referred to a neighbouring district where there are daily deliveries and contrasted with it the tri-weekly deliveries in Kildangan. I might point out that in itself is not a justification for a daily delivery in this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason increased postal facilities are asked for in Kildangan is that circumstances have altered considerably there in the last year or two, and there has been an increase in the number of letters delivered there and there has also been an increase in regard to telegrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration was given to this point.  We have information as to the number of letters dealt with in Kildangan.  If certain people of considerable importance in the county have the misfortune to set up their business there that is not our fault.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of letters to be delivered would not justify an increased service.  This case was very carefully examined and was fully explained to the persons interested, and I think they were fairly well satisfied, in so far as it is possible to satisfy people who are not given the concessions for which they ask.  But we gave certain facilities and certain concessions in that area which were regarded as improvements.  I am willing to have the matter reopened and reconsidered, but I cannot hold out any hope that further concessions will be given.</P>

      <P>Are the telephone charges made to these same people the normal charges or are they exceptional because of the position of the place?  It does look curious that at a place within forty miles of Dublin people should have to pay £24 a year for a telephone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The telephone charges are different.  They have nothing to do with the fact that this place is forty miles from Dublin but are based on the distance from the nearest telephone exchange and on the amount of equipment that has to be supplied in order to provide the necessary facilities.  The charges are based on the actual cost and are such as to ensure that the Post Office does not suffer a loss, but also to make fairly certain that the Post Office will not gain anything.  They are based on the actual cost.</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am now dealing with the Post Office there; Deputies must not rush to the conclusion that I am dealing with the high power station.  There are difficulties about securing a site in Athlone, but we are looking into the matter and we will provide suitable accommodation as soon as possible.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the congestion in Rathmines.  I have already dealt with that.  Deputy Gorry, amongst <Col N="2074" /> other things, referred to the charge for delivering telegrams.  We acknowledge that that charge is very high in rural areas, but it is only just sufficient to defray the actual cost of delivery.  It is high, but when you send a postal messenger our two, three or four miles it costs something, and the amount charged is only sufficient to defray the actual cost of paying the boy-messengers who are employed.</P>

      <P>When this Estimate was being discussed last year the Parliamentary Secretary promised to do something for people who live at a distance from the Post Office and who have to pay heavy charges for the delivery of their telegrams.  He promised that, the matter having received his attention, something would be done to remedy it, as he agreed that the situation was not equitable. We find now, at the end of twelve months, that he merely states that the charges pay for the cost of delivering the telegrams, and he holds out no hope of improving the position of these people.  Surely that is not treating them in a fair way.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Savings Bank department, has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into account the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain has said that he is considering the question of raising the interest on savings bank deposits?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary taken into account the serious effect that such a step would have on the Savings Bank here, as inevitably it would mean that a considerable amount of money that would otherwise go to the Saorstát Savings Bank would go to the Savings Bank in Belfast or other towns in the North?  Has he also taken into account the increased difficulty that there would be in getting a return of the money of Saorstát depositors that is deposited in the British Post Office Savings Bank, and will he make representations to the Minister for Finance that if the rate of interest in Great Britain is increased it will be correspondingly increased here?</P>

      <P>I have already answered Deputy Maguire's points.  If we can be sure that there is any intention on the part of the British Post Office Savings Bank authorities to increase the rate of interest, consideration will be given and cognisance taken of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view that might be put forward.  It is the policy of the Department to charge what will pay for delivery. The effect of reducing the charge would be to increase the loss.  The Deputy's is not a point of view held by us at the moment.  Deputy Corish suggested that the telephone directory should be compiled according to towns or districts.  Very careful consideration was given to that suggestion when it was made last year. In fact, it was considered several times previously, and it was found that it would not be suitable or acceptable.  We believe the general concensus of opinion is in favour of the present system.  Deputy Corish's system would possibly be suitable for small towns, but would not be the proper one for a large city with surrounding townships.</P>

We do not stand upon the Estimates as an indication of the financial position of the Post Office; we stand on our commercial accounts.  The reason for the ostensible increase in the number of the staff is that the number given in the Estimate for last year was minus the suggested decrease that would have resulted from the curtailment of the rural services which did not materialise. The staff has not actually increased since last year.</P>

Of this amount, about £3,000 must be regarded as a set-off on a commercial account basis for interest on capital and provision for depreciation, leaving net <Col N="2079" /> estimated surplus of £8,427.  All these figures are subject to such minor alterations as may be necessary when the various accounts have been closed.</P>
      <P>The number of licences issued last year was 25,269, showing a decrease of 756 as compared with the previous year.  This decrease is probably mainly due to a fall in the number of crystal sets in use not being overtaken by an increase in the number of valve sets.  Most people who begin with crystal sets hope eventually to get valve sets, so that the number of valve sets tends to increase continually and of crystal sets to fall.  This is the case where the service afforded (i.e., the crystal range of the existing stations) remains unaltered.  The slight setback in the number of licences is, however, regarded as only temporary and it is expected that it will soon be recovered and be followed by a steady increase.  The extent to which evasion of payment of licence fees exists is problematical, but the question of taking further action, by legislation if necessary, with a view to enforcing payment of licence fees is under consideration.</P>
      <P>The revenue of £30,700 from the Customs tax on wireless apparatus shows an increase of about £3,000 over the previous year.  This tax provides the greater part of the broadcasting revenue.  Policy in regard to the tax is a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Finance, but so far as the Post Office is concerned, there appears to be no present possibility of raising sufficient money for the broadcasting service by any other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revenue for the current year, 1930-31, is estimated at £14,000 from licence fees and £30,000 from the import tax, making gross revenue of £44,000, or, deducting cost of collection at 10 per cent., net revenue of £39,600.  Total expenditure on the Dublin and Cork stations out of all Votes is estimated at £32,000, leaving gross surplus of £7,600, of which £3,000 must be earmarked against interest and depreciation.  This means that the Dublin and Cork stations, <Col N="2080" /> i.e., the service at present operated, should produce a surplus of about £4,500.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting being a State undertaking there is an obligation on the State to provide so far as possible equality of service for all the population. Such obligation is the more imperative when private enterprise is not permitted to provide a service. The Dublin and Cork stations were not erected with any hope of providing a service throughout the entire Saorstát.  They were intended to give a local crystal service only, with further developments in view.</P>
    <P>Of the total population of approximately 3,000,000 only about 700,000 or 23 per cent. are estimated to reside within the range of crystal reception of the Dublin and Cork stations. The use of a valve set is necessary at distances of over about 15-20 miles, and therefore reception on cheap sets is available to less than one-quarter of the population.  Moreover, owing to the location of the Dublin and Cork stations, reception even on valve sets is difficult in parts of the country owing to inadequate signal strength or the incidence of the phenomenon known as &ldquo;fading.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The best possible service having regard to the technical problems involved could be provided by a central high-power station.  A station of 60 kilowatts aerial power, such as it is proposed to erect, would, it is estimated, afford good reception on crystal sets to about 2,200,000 or 75 per cent. of the population, and good to fair reception on simple valve sets to a considerable number of the remaining 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is expected that reasonably good crystal reception from the high-power station will be practicable within a radius of 80 miles; beyond that up to 90 or 100 miles good reception on valve sets is anticipated. At distances over 90 miles from the station &ldquo;fading&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., coming and going of signals&mdash;is likely to occur. On this account good reception even on valve sets may not be possible in some parts of the extreme southwest, west and north-west seaboards. It is hoped, however, that the latest <Col N="2081" /> technical developments may help towards overcoming this trouble, but the position of the Department is that constant good reception cannot be guaranteed in advance in these areas.</P>
    <P>The wave-length of the Dublin station, 413 metres, is suitable for a high power station, and it will be utilised for the new station.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of affording crystal reception to the majority of the population, the erection of a central high-power station is likely to become necessary in order that a service of any kind worth the name could be given.  Broadcasting development in Great Britain and European countries generally is in the direction of high-power stations. Great Britain is erecting six twin wave high-power stations, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy already possess stations of 50 or 60 kilowatt power, and several other such stations are in course of erection or are projected. The signals received in the Saorstát from these stations, although not constant (i.e. subject to &ldquo;fading,&rdquo; etc.), are of considerable strength, and as the number of these stations increases reception of the Dublin and Cork stations becomes more difficult except in fairly close proximity to these stations.</P>
    <P>The all-in capital cost of the high-power station, it is estimated, will be between £70,000 and £75,000.  The actual cost within these limits must depend upon realisation of necessarily approximate estimates for buildings and equipment.  It is quite certain that the higher figure will not be exceeded.  Moreover, of the total capital expenditure £12,500 is for Customs Duty on plant, etc., so that the actual total cost of the high-power station will be between £57,500 and £62,500.</P>
    <P>Of the total estimated capital expenditure, the amount provided for in the current financial year 1930-31 is £50,700, made up of £47,700 in the Broadcasting Estimate and £3,000 in the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings, leaving a balance of approximately £20,000 to £25,000 to be voted in the financial year 1931-32.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The annual charges are estimated at about £9,000 in respect of interest on capital and depreciation, and £11,000 on running and maintenance costs.  So that additional annual revenue of £20,000 will be required to cover the recurring charges.</P>
    <P>Minimum estimates of revenue at saturation point allow for a revenue of £65,000, or, deducting cost of collection at 10 per cent., net revenue of £58,500.  Deducting from this amount of £58,500 the total expenditure at the present rate on the Dublin and Cork Stations of £34,500 shows increased revenue of £24,000 which will be sufficient to cover charges of the high-power station with some thousands over for programme development.</P>
    <P>On a commercial basis the Broadcasting Service has an accumulated surplus of £13,500, so that there is every likelihood that it will pay its way in the future and, perhaps, continue to produce a surplus.</P>
    <P>Station Orchestra&mdash;A proposal for an increase in the numbers of the Station Orchestra is at present under consideration.  Symphony Concerts&mdash;Four Symphony Concerts were given by the 2RN Symphony Orchestra during the past winter season.  The public concerts were discontinued owing to lack of public support.</P>
    <P>Other important broadcasts during the year included five concerts of the Dublin Philharmonic Society, two operas by the Dublin Operatic Society, and ten operas by the Station Opera Company.  Also concerts of the Waterford Oratorio Society, the Waterford Musical Society, and the Sligo Musical Society.</P>
    <P>A special feature of the programmes last year was the broadcasts in connection with the Catholic Emancipation celebrations in the Phoenix Park and at Cashel.  The programmes also included descriptions of the Dublin Horse Show Jumping Competitions, the Phoenix Park Motor Races, and many hurling and football matches, Gaelic, Rugby and Soccer.</P>
    <P>Talks Programmes&mdash;The question of development of the Talks Programme <Col N="2083" /> is under special consideration, and it is hoped to arrange for lectures over a more varied range of subjects next winter.</P>
    <P>The market reports broadcast include daily Stock Exchange report, weekly report from the Trade Commissioner in Great Britain, weekly bulletin supplied by the Department of Agriculture, London Provision Market, Salford Cattle Market, etc.</P>
    <P>The question of special Schools programmes has been under consideration in conjunction with the Department of Education for a considerable time.  The success of schools programmes depends upon the installation of receiving sets in primary schools throughout the country.  No definite steps can be taken to promote such installations pending the erection of the high-power station as the kind of set required and, therefore, the cost, will depend upon the service given by the high-power station.  The question will, however, be fully considered in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of the Department of Education in arranging an Adult Educational Talks programme has been sought.  News Service&mdash; The arrangements for the news service have been recently revised and a better service is now being given. Foreign Relays&mdash;A number of experimental relays of foreign programmes were carried out during the winter and the results were on the whole successful.  Inclusion of such relays as regular programme items must be deferred pending arrangements with foreign stations in regard to re-transmission rights.</P>

      <P>Before the discussion starts would the Parliamentary Secretary say who is finally responsible for the artists selected?  Has the Director at the station the right to veto the artists selected by the Musical Director?  Has he the final right to say who will perform or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Station Director has the final say, subject, of expenditure on the salaries of <Col N="2084" /> course, to the ratification, if necessary, of the political head of the Department.  Naturally the political head does not interfere with the selection of artists for the programme, but he has the right to interfere if he so desires.  In regard to musical items there is a Musical Director who is subject to the overriding authority of the Station Director.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few remarks which I desire to make in connection with this Estimate.  Looking over the figures, one is struck by the fact that the proportion of the total expenditure which is proposed to be spent on programmes appears to be very low, even when the estimated costs of the new high power station are taken out of the accounts. I took the trouble of comparing the figures for the wireless broadcasting service here with those for the service given by the British Broadcasting Company.  I find that of the total expenditure in Britain 65 per cent. is spent on programmes but only 45 per cent. of the total expenditure here is devoted to the same purpose.  On the other hand, seven per cent. of the total expenditure in Britain is paid in salaries to officials whereas 28 per cent. of the total expenditure here goes to the same purpose.  On the maintenance of plant the figures are: 19 per cent. in Britain and 10 per cent. here.  For overhead charges, such as rates, office accommodation, etc., the figures are 9 per cent. in Britain and 17 per cent. here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably inevitable that the <Col N="2085" /> officials should be proportionately higher here than in England in consequence of the smaller nature of the service, but the difference appears to be very great&mdash;so great, indeed, as to suggest that the station here is over staffed if the service in England is taken as a criterion.  That we should spend proportionately four times the amount on salaries of officials than is found necessary in England seems to suggest that some revision in that direction is possible. If such revision was effected it would enable the amount spent on programmes to be increased to a point nearer to the proportionate amount spent by the British Broadcasting Company.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there is considerable dissatisfaction with the general nature of the programmes.  Undoubtedly very good artists and very good performers have been engaged occasionally. The complaints which are current, however, are to the effect that a lack of originality is shown in selecting the programmes and a lack of variety in the nature of the items provided.  The Parliamentary Secretary has just stated that the station director is solely responsible for the nature of the programmes and for the artists selected to perform. Amongst the complaints which I have heard very frequently are statements to the effect that one particular artist of no great ability who happens to be a relative of the station director is given undue opportunities of performing, while other artists of known and recognised ability, who have made application to be allowed to give performances, have not been asked to do so. It has been alleged that one must be a friend of the station director or in a position to influence a friend of the station director to get a chance of performing.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly it is possible that these complaints are exaggerated, because the persons who are rejected by the station director always attribute that fact to causes other than their own lack of ability, but at the same time, if the Parliamentary <Col N="2086" /> Secretary will go into the matter, he will find that persons whose ability to give performances has been recognised by the number of engagements they have received at concerts and similar functions, have not been given opportunities of performing at the wireless station, whereas other performers of questionable ability appear frequently, even though in some cases letters have been written to the Press appealing to the station director to keep them off.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that the estimated number of licences to be issued in the coming year is less than the actual number issued last year.  I notice from the Estimate that the receipts anticipated from licence fees are £14,000 as against £15,000 last year.  I do not know whether the falling off in the receipts from licence fees is to be attributed to the programmes or not, but it seems peculiar that this reduction in receipts from licence fees should be expected to take place in the year in which a new high-power station will be erected and commence to operate. The case for the high-power station is that the service will continue to be a paying one even after it has been constructed, because in addition to the surplus now available, the revenue from licence fees and import duties will be increased to cover the additional outlay.</P>
    <P>There is another item on the Estimate regarding which we want some information.  That is the estimated receipts of £50 from advertising.  I do not know to what extent wireless stations have been used for advertising, and if it is intended to develop the practice of using them for that purpose to any extent.  Undoubtedly the revenue of the station could probably be considerably increased if facilities for advertising were given, but I doubt if the popularity of the station would be increased as well. In fact, in the United States practically the only source of revenue of the various privately-owned stations operating there is advertising.  Either advertising through the wireless station should be definitely banned or, if not banned, should be developed upon some pre-conceived plan. <Col N="2087" /> I do not know what the present arrangement is, but I would like to be informed.  Are facilities only given to a limited number of advertisers or is it generally known that commercial firms can, if they so desire, advertise their goods through the wireless station?  Personally, I would prefer to see advertising definitely kept out of it altogether, because those who are compelled to listen-in to the Dublin station, because of their inability to get other stations while it is in operation, want to hear whatever programmes are offered and not the merits of somebody's pills or somebody else's boots.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish a high-power station is a wise one, and, as was pointed out by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, an inevitable one.  In view of the state of the revenue of the service which, as the Parliamentary Secretary told us exceeds by £4,500 the total expenditure, the only alternative to the establishment of a high - power station would have been a reduction in fees or duties, but the decision to establish a high-power station is right, because there are quite a number of people not wealthy enough to afford valve sets who would be glad to instal crystal sets if the facilities were offered to them.  In that connection I want to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to complaints which have been the subject of correspondence and articles in the Press concerning the method of charging on portable receiving sets.  Originally the arrangement was that a 10/- licence would cover all wireless apparatus in the home, whether there were one, two or three sets&mdash;crystal, valve or both. Some time ago there was a new order issued by the Department to the effect that the fee for a licence for the possession of a portable wireless set should be 10/-, but that such licence should only be issued to a person who had already secured a licence for an apparatus of the fixed variety.  The arrangement works out in such a manner that a person owning a portable receiving set must take out a licence for a set <Col N="2088" /> he has not got, before he can get a licence for the portable set.  There seems to be no justification for that arrangement whatever.  I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary has increased the revenue of the service in consequence of that arrangement.  The portable receiving set is very hard to detect in actual practice, and the owner need not pay any licence fee if he does not want to.  He is not encouraged to pay by this ridiculous arrangement which compels him in the end to pay double fee.  I think that that order, issued by the Department of Finance, should be revised and the fee upon portable sets made the same as on all other forms of receiving sets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been unduly optimistic as regards the future of this Department. This is one of the very few Departments which the Dáil has had control of practically since its inception and the Dáil has the making or marring of the Department in its own hands.  This Department is distinct from all other Departments inasmuch as it is entirely dependent upon the goodwill of the listeners and if there are no listeners this Department sinks.  If there are plenty of listeners, the State will benefit.  Yet it is the one Department where those by whom the State benefits are least considered. For a considerable period of time associations of listeners and individual listeners have been writing to this Department and expressing their views and trying in every possible manner to have their grievances met in some way, but they have been absolutely turned down by whoever controls the Department. The Advisory Committee of course is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary bases his calculations as regards the high-power station on the past.  He forgets that when wireless was introduced it was something novel, that people took it up out of curiosity or as a hobby and very few took it up as an essential of the household.  Last year the number <Col N="2089" /> of listeners dropped considerably. The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that there are 700 less licence holders at present than there were this time last year.  He tries to argue that the explanation of that is that crystal users have now become valve users and refers to the increased customs revenue as an indication that his statement is correct. I want to challenge that and tell him that he is absolutely wrong. The increase in the customs revenue is due practically entirely to the importation of eliminators, most of which have been imported by the Electricity Supply Board to replace eliminators already in use in view of the change of the current in the Rathmines and Pembroke districts. If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks I am wrong in that he can get a special return from the Customs and Excise Department and he will find that there was a great number of eliminators included in last year's returns and that they account for the increase in customs revenue, and that it is not, as he says, due to the change over from crystal to valve sets.  Last year I suggested to him that he should keep a record of crystal users as distinct from valve users and he stated that it was a good suggestion which he would adopt.  He has taken great care to-day not to state what the proportions are; how many licence holders were crystal users last year and how many this year; and how many were valve users. These are the kind of particulars that we want on this Estimate rather than the hypothetical arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Parliamentary Secretary is at last considering the question of an educational programme, particularly for the use of schools.  I am particularly glad because it indicates that at last we are going to have afternoon programmes which will help considerably the people engaged in the wireless business who will by that means be able to test wireless apparatus for prospective customers <Col N="2090" /> which they have not been able to do up to the present.</P>
    <P>Before entering upon a general criticism of the Estimate, I should like to ask for some information on certain points.  In the Dublin station we have a station director. That would indicate to the public generally that he is a director who knows his business from all its angles.  But if we look at the explanatory note given we find that this is a temporary position filled by a divisional inspector seconded from the Insurance Commission on a certain scale of salary.  How is the public to have confidence in a station director selected in that way? Surely the director should be a permanent official selected because of his particular knowledge and experience which would justify his being appointed.  Possibly next year some other Civil Servant will get a chance of being the station director for a period of twelve months, and we shall continue to have the experience of having directors who are not fit for the post.  I say that the present director cannot be suitable for this post because of the proof before us in the shape of the criticism of, and general disatisfaction with, the programmes given and the whole system on which the Department is run.  The station director and the assistant director get an allowance, and I should like to know what that is for.  The musical director is a part-time appointment.  I should like to know why it is not possible to have a competent director who could cover both these positions.  Why should there be a director in the general sense and a part-time director for the musical programme at a salary of £400 per annum when as we know the musical end forms a very small part of the programme.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the possibility of getting a good station director who could not only direct the general running of the station but who would also be competent from the point of view of being able to direct the musical programme.  In addition to these officials, we have an announcer.  The <Col N="2091" /> whole staff seems to be temporary and on probation, and I suppose will continue to be so, and the public possibly will continue being dissatisfied and never will get any satisfaction in regard to the programmes produced.  The experience of last year's directors will not be that of next year's directors, and the result is that we shall never have a director or staff who will be able to give the public the benefit of continued experience.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also provides for a news correspondent.  I do not know whether he has been appointed yet, but his salary is provided for.  In conjunction with the news correspondent, we have provision made for a news assistant, or is it that this news assistant is going to be promoted to be news correspondent?  I cannot understand that part of the Estimate because the amount of news given certainly does not entail work for two individuals.</P>

      <P>Now I come to the high-power station.  The Parliamentary Secretary, only a couple of days ago, intimated that they had not yet decided on the site, that they were making experiments but that they had not yet satisfied themselves as to the site for the new station.  These Estimates, I suppose, are based upon some knowledge as to where the station is to be located, otherwise <Col N="2092" /> they would not be able to say what the cost would be.  We also have the personnel for the high-power station.  Either the Parliamentary Secretary has already plans, and the site has already been located, and he is keeping the information back, or this is a haphazard guess at the whole thing, and should not be there at all, and should be introduced on a Supplementary Estimate rather than on the basis of this Estimate. They must know where their station is going to be.  Possibly it may not be Athlone after all, but it might not be wise to announce that until after the election.  I should not be surprised if I found that the high-power station is not going to be in Athlone, but I do not believe that the Minister or his Department would put down an estimate if they had no knowledge where they were going to locate the site, what class of buildings they were going to put on that site, and what the site was going to cost.  As to the items for transmission&mdash;the electrical end of it &mdash;the same apparatus would do wherever the site was and that part of it could be very accurately estimated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass asked some questions with regard to the method of the selection of the artistes, and he suggested that in one particular case the performer must have had no other qualification for appointment than that she was a relation of somebody who was able to secure the engagement for her.  I am inclined to think that there is too much patronage in that particular department, and I should like to throw out a rough suggestion for the Parliamentary Secretary to consider.  The plays chosen for broadcasting have practically all been of an unsuitable type, and the productions from the point of view of the listeners, have not been at all attractive or satisfactory. The advisory committee may advise all right, but I feel that they do not do their duty and sit down and listen-in as they should, because if they had themselves listened to some of the plays before they were produced they would never have been broadcasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> The same applies to the station director.  I would make a suggestion in this regard to the Minister for Finance, and that is, that he should provide the Parliamentary Secretary with a crystal set and a pair of headphones, and sentence him to listen-in for a few nights.  I do not suggest a valve set, because that is not the way to judge properly transmission or broadcasting, but if he listened through a pair of headphones, or if the director listened, I think there would very soon be a rapid change. All kinds of noises come through them that ought never be allowed to come through at all.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the language lessons, I spoke about these last year also.  I wonder if the Department of Education really think that a person listening through headphones or valve sets to the Irish language being read is going, in that way, to obtain an elementary knowledge of Irish.  If I went to the station and read out English or German from a book, how many people would benefit from my reading in that way.  If the Department of Education want to promote the Irish language by means of wireless they should, at least, find some other way of teaching it than by reading as is the case at the present time.  I would suggest, first of all, that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider this matter from a business point of view.  The upkeep of this particular Department depends upon the listeners.  The State is making a certain small profit now, but licence-holders are falling off, and unless drastic changes are made, and unless they listen to the demands of those who pay&mdash;and, as has often been said, those who pay the piper have the right to demand the tune&mdash; they will find themselves compelled to admit a loss on this Department as on the Post Office Department.  We want to avoid that, and it can only be avoided if the matter is taken up in time.  I suggest, firstly, the appointment of an independent committee of inquiry, consisting mainly of representatives of listeners and potential listeners who have been lost or gone over to foreign stations, and disregarded 2RN and the Cork <Col N="2094" /> station by some new concoction that cuts them out altogether.  Secondly, I suggest a programme committee to advise and, if necessary, to supervise the arrangement of the programmes independently.  After all, the main business that should occupy the permanent officials is to see that everything is technically right, that the station is run properly, and that the State does not lose.  They should understand this is not an essential service which can be regarded as if it were a matter of weights or measures, or of dollars or cents.</P>
    <P>If a certain lady has been singing over the wireless broadcasting since its inception and if we are tired of her, then for God's sake give her a rest and get somebody else; and if there are three or four ladies whom we are tired of hearing and whom we feel are not worth listening to, let us give them a holiday and get someone else to do it.  The third suggestion that I make is that the Abbey Players or the Gaelic Players (Dublin and Galway) be broadcast instead of the strolling or scrap companies or cliques who broadcast at present without any guiding principle in the matter of selection and production of plays.  I make this further suggestion also that Sunday night's programme be discontinued from the Cork studio, as very few listen to it since it was first arranged and let us have the Dublin programme on instead.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself admitted that certain outlying districts should be better catered for in the matter of reception.  He admitted that they do not get good reception on valve sets from 2RN.  Listeners in Kerry, for instance, cannot get 2RN on the valve sets, while London, Paris and Daventry come in quite audibly.  If the Department's officials would experiment a little in this end of the business, on the technical end, and see what is wrong and show us how the reception could be got instead of experimenting with the artistes.  I think the result would be good.  Before I conclude I would like to read something the Parliamentary Secretary had before him already, that is, an extract from the &ldquo;Sunday Independent,&rdquo;<Col N="2095" /> May 4th.  It is headed &ldquo;Realistic Programme,&rdquo; and reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irish listeners to the Daventry transmissions will be glad to hear that &lsquo;Intimate Snapshots,&rsquo; by Lance Sieveking, is to be heard again in the B.B.C. National programme of May 12.  In this &lsquo;argument between two people,&rsquo; as it is called, special arrangements have been made as regards the underground scenes and the newspaper office scenes, and the listener will find it almost impossible to believe that the actors are not in an underground station, with electric trains passing all the time, while the thudding of the printing presses will take him into the heart of Fleet Street.  Why could we not have an equally imaginative programme from the Dublin station?  Although the general quality of the Saorstát programmes may be said to have improved, I have not yet noticed anything out of the ordinary in the way of imaginative programme presentation.  It is not merely a question of money&mdash;or the lack of it; encouragement should be given to artistes to submit original ideas for programmes.  In fact, I think that the authorities should be prepared to pay for good suggestions, which could afterwards be developed by artistes chosen by the director.  Constructive work is necessary.  If we wait for something to turn up it is ten chances to one that we will wait in vain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed by &ldquo;Electron.&rdquo;  I will make a final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I made an appeal last year and the year before and certain other Deputies joined me in that appeal.  My suggestion is: let the listeners have representation so that they will be able to decide and argue how to get improved programmes, and they will be able to get something novel in the shape of programmes.  Last, but not least, it is absolutely imperative to get decent artistes who would be worth listening to and who will not be <Col N="2096" /> tiring on the listeners and thrown aside with the exclamation: &ldquo;Thank God that is over.&rdquo;  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he adopts those suggestions, will not be disappointed with his hopes in regard to the additional revenue to the State when this new power station has been erected, and that people who have ceased to be listeners will take out licences again. I believe that benefits will accrue from having such a committee as I have suggested, and there will be advantages all round.  I make that final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I believe if he really looked into the matter from the point of view of the difficulties of the present or past Advisory Committee he will find that it would be far better to leave the technical end of the business to the Department's officials, but that the programme should be left entirely to the Advisory Committee, on which representation could be given to associations and listeners generally.</P>

This new high-power station which has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary will give an opportunity to the people in the country to get cheap crystal sets and in that way, within a distance of eighty or ninety miles of the station they can get a good reception.  Consequently, that would mean that if a good site is selected, a site pretty centrally situated in the country, the people in the middle and western part of the country would be able to have the advantages of the wireless through the use of crystal sets.  In that connection, I would like to impress <Col N="2097" /> upon the Parliamentary Secretary that Birr is the most centrally situated part of the country.  Then again, from the point of elevation it has an advantage as compared with other centres such as Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the cruel suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe that the Parliamentary Secretary should have something to say to the fixing of the programme.  If the Parliamentary Secretary had been down in my part of the country he would have a terrible experience.  Deputy Fahy tells us that in Galway it was impossible to hear the programme.  We can hear the programme sometimes in Waterford but we hear it very badly. It is not because the programmes are bad that we complain, but that the method of transmission is bad. It is not so much the programmes that we complain of in Waterford as the transmission.  I was very glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that more attention has been given to educational programmes.  I would suggest when the new station is erected the headmasters of the secondary schools should be approached and a suitable series of lectures and talks of an educational nature arranged.  What I am trying to get at is this&mdash;those of us who listen occasionally to other stations hear lectures from eminent people whom we would never have a chance of hearing except for these opportunities. Really one gets very valuable information and one gets inside knowledge into matters that one would never have a chance of hearing otherwise, were it not for wireless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If suitable lectures were arranged for schools it would be of great benefit to education.  As far as the primary schools are concerned I really think it might be too early to start.  As it is, the primary school programmes are too crowded, and there is no use in inflicting further <Col N="2099" /> information on the pupils.  With regard to the musical side of the programmes, as Deputy Briscoe said, those who pay the piper should be entitled to call the tune, but I think it would not be advisable to give way to them too much.  In some of the British stations they carried out a plebiscite of listeners.  That was right.  Speaking of the present programme, I think there is too much light music being broadcast, and I think an effort should be made to create a better musical taste amongst the people.  If we adopt the plan of catering always for the lighter side of things we will fail entirely from an educational point of view.  Every effort should be made to improve the taste of the people by a system of suitable lectures on music and the provision of the lighter class of good music.  I know that inflicting heavy classical music on people all at once has a rather disastrous effect, but it could be led up to gradually by lighter classical music and by a course of instruction from people competent to give it.</P>
    <P>The question of language lessons was dealt with by Deputy Briscoe.  I must say that when I did get Dublin I found the Irish language lessons particularly well done.  A lady whose name I cannot remember gave very good language lessons.  If they are to be continued when the new high-power station is in being I am sure that they will be appreciated all over the country.  Deputy Briscoe reminds me that perhaps I appreciate them because I happen to be a speaker of the language, but I do really think that the teacher was very good.  If I happened to be a mere beginner I think I would have thoroughly appreciated her work.</P>
    <P>Sets are being dismantled here and there throughout the country, and the people who own them are being threatened with prosecution even though they prove they have dismantled their sets.  It is not fair that people should be worried in that way. Surely it should be possible for the local postal officials to ascertain if the sets have been dismantled and if <Col N="2100" /> the aerial is down.  Threatening people with prosecution is carrying the thing too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe's criticisms were so obviously extreme that I will not make more than one or two remarks about them.  I do not agree with him that the station staff are slow to take suggestions. My experience has been that they are quite ready to consider suggestions; I found them so on many occasions.  I do not agree with Deputy Briscoe that broadcasting is on the down grade as regards popularity. If it is so in the Free State I think you will have to ask yourself the question why.  It is not on the down grade in popularity in other countries.  One has only to see the way the licence revenue is growing elsewhere in order to satisfy one's self about the matter.  Deputy Goulding and Deputy Briscoe were very much on the spot when they said that trying to do two contradictory things in the past in our broadcasting programme was not advisable.  We are trying to slice in educational features with what must be, as an evening programme, something more of an amusement kind if it is to satisfy the popular demand.  If you try to spoil the entertainment side of the programme in the evening with educational features you will undoubtedly cut off a large number of listeners.  If you try to slice in that educational feature at a time when people are much more disposed to look for entertainment, very often a lighter kind of entertainment in the evening after they cease work &mdash;I refer to the great majority of the people and not to members of the Dáil&mdash;it is bound to diminish the popularity of broadcasting.  If you try to mix the entertainment character of the programme with educational features to more than a very slight extent you will find that the programmes will diminish in popularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done yet in testing the educational value of broadcasting.  Personally I believe it is of great value if done properly, but I think it will have to be <Col N="2101" /> done at special times if you are to get value out of the educational parts of the programme.  You will only succeed in spoiling both parts if you try to mix them up.  If you were to get the view of probably 90 per cent. of those who listen-in to broadcasting I believe they would tell you that you are making a mistake in forcing Irish on them in the midst of their entertainment.  No doubt there are a few enthusiasts like Deputy Goulding who can profit by it.  My belief is that they are very few, and if you want to give your instruction in languages I think it should be done at special times when those who want to learn the languages can pay attention to them and get real instruction without interfering with the entertainment that you are trying to give to the far greater proportion of those who pay licence fees.  I am not speaking against the cultural value of the entertainment. That cultural value may be quite high if the programme is properly chosen.  Instead of turning it into something the great majority of the people do not want and will not listen to, the broadcasting programme should be made more popular.  Undoubtedly up to the present the greatest proportion of listeners have not been crystal users.  I am strongly in favour of the high power station, and the sooner we get it the better, because I think the result of it will be the introduction of a great number of crystal sets throughout the country districts, and there, I think, the value of a properly chosen entertainment will be very high indeed.</P>
    <P>There I think the cultural value of a properly chosen entertainment will be very high but I rise simply to try and emphasise a point which I believe is of importance.  We cannot do two contradictory things at the same time.  In the evenings give an entertainment programme, and give your instruction at separate times to those who want that instruction and who will tune-in in order to listen.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the future of wireless is going to be assured in this country by the erection <Col N="2102" /> of a high power station.  It comes as very good news to-day when the Parliamentary Secretary cannot hold out very much hope to us in the rural areas that a reduction in the rate for the transmission of wires can be hoped for.  I am certainly in agreement with Deputy Thrift and others that there will be a great demand for crystal sets in the country districts when a high power station is established.  In that respect I wish on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Boland, with whom I was discussing this matter yesterday, to say that sympathetic consideration should be given to Birr as a likely centre.  He give me figures. Unfortunately he is not able to be here himself to-day, but with regard to Birr and Athlone he has given me figures, which he secured in the Library.  The altitude of Birr is 281, and that of Athlone is 179.  In the British regime Birr was the centre of the Royal Observatory. When the British selected Birr as a centre for the Royal Observatory they must have had some good reason.  I put forward those points for consideration when the site is being selected and if it is selected already I hope Birr is the place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking on this Vote, gave some comparative figures as to the apportioned cost of the programmes, the overhead cost, etc., in the B.B.C. as compared with 2RN.  Having given those figures Deputy Lemass himself practically acknowledged that they were justified.  The reasons are quite obvious.  The overhead and operation expenses must naturally be higher in a service where the total revenue is low compared with the service where the total revenue is high.  That is the situation existing in the Free State services as compared with the B.B.C. Similarly the programme expenditure is almost necessarily bound to be much higher proportionately in a State where the revenue is high as compared with a State where the revenue is low for the reason that the surplus after operation and overhead expenses have been paid is bound to be <Col N="2103" /> greater in the country where the number of listeners is very large as compared with the country where the number of listeners is small. The obvious remedy for us is to provide a high power station, thereby extending the number of listeners and extending our revenue.  Our estimates are that the proportion of this expense mentioned by Deputy Lemass will in future alter to our advantage and be more in conformity with the situation existing in the B.B.C. stations.</P>
      <P>On the question of the programme perhaps it would be well to group the various statements made by Deputies and to endeavour to deal with them all together.  There were certain criticisms from Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe with regard to the attitude of the present station director towards the engaging of artists and it was suggested, if not actually stated, that he shows favouritism in the selection of artists who are to broadcast from 2RN. A charge of that kind is very easy to make and very difficult to disprove.  A person who has charge of an artistic institution of this kind and who has in his hands the employing of or the refusal to employ a considerable number of artists and who is obliged to make selections is bound to incur a considerable amount of unpopularity on the part of those who are not selected or who do not get as many engagements as they would like to have.  I am not prepared to accept for a moment that our station director has been partial.  It seems to me that a charge of that kind should be proved.  If it is proved there is only one remedy for it, that is, to dispense with the services of a station director who would be guilty of such conduct. But I have no evidence and have seen no indication to prove that such is the case.  It is bound to happen, that certain people will feel they do not get a fair show, and in a matter of this kind of selection on artists' merits it must depend to a large extent on the personal predilections of the station director, that is, on his judgment of what is good and what is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> I personally would hesitate to over-ride his views in that direction and for that reason I have not interfered with the arrangements as to the employment of artists to any appreciable extent or perhaps to any extent at all.  I may have intervened, and, in fact, I have intervened and discussed the question of the general construction of a programme, but with regard to the particular employment of artists, so long as we have a station director in whom we place reliance, we must leave that work to him.  I would say if Deputies feel they have glaring cases with regard to the non-employment of suitable artists they will get my personal attention and I will look into them, but I do not believe that such a charge can be proved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe entered into some semi-personal details of the qualifications of a particular station director whom he discovers on examination of the Estimate is seconded to us from the Insurance Commission and therefore is not suitably qualified for the position he has undertaken. Possibly the Deputy has not gone to any particular trouble to ascertain the qualifications of the director in question because, if he had gone to some trouble he would find that he was selected because of certain particular and specialised qualifications.  He has in addition a general knowledge of subjects which are essential for programme construction.  It is a peculiarly difficult and onerous position and is very hard to fill.  He has to deal with a great variety of subjects and he has to have a general knowledge of all those subjects and to have a specialised knowledge in certain directions.  I do not agree with Deputy Briscoe that if we are to select civil servants haphazardly that we are likely at all to get a suitable station director.</P>

      <P>The whole institution is on a semi-permanent basis so far.  He is not permanently established so far.  I think the Deputy will find that all the employees are on a temporary basis.  Deputy Lemass dealt with the question of licence fees.  He pointed out that the estimate for licences for the coming year is less than the estimate of licence fees for last year.  That is so, but the estimate for licences for last year was not reached; the number of licences was less than we anticipated.  But the estimate for licences this year shows an increase on the number of licences that were taken out last year.</P>
      <P>The question of advertising was raised by Deputy Lemass.  He called attention to the fact that the small amount of £50 was secured from advertising. He wanted to know if there is a definite policy in regard to advertising and if any consideration has been given to the extension of advertising with a view to increased revenue.  The question of advertising from 2RN was very carefully examined and we have an advertisement policy.  We charge certain fees for advertising. It was found in practice that we were unable to get any advertising work of any considerable volume. The number of people who are prepared to pay the necessary fees for advertising is very small.  The number of people appealed to is so comparatively small as not to pay people for paying high fees for advertising. We simply keep in existence the right to let certain time for advertising purposes.  On certain occasions we may be called on for advertising announcements, but the number is very small as shown by the total revenue accruing from advertising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Trade advertisements <Col N="2106" /> have practically cut themselves out.  I think it would be unwise definitely to lay down a regulation cutting them out.  There may be some development in the future.  The general policy in this country is that the broadcasting station must pay its way from the licence fees or revenue duties and we are not expecting to get revenue to any appreciable extent from advertising. I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Lemass speak in a vexatious way of people being compelled to listen to Dublin, evidently suggesting that the programme was not of a desirable or an attractive nature.  I express surprise at that in view of the general policy of Deputy Lemass.  I would expect if Deputy Lemass and his Party had control of the broadcasting station that they would compel people to listen-in to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be their policy.  There was a question as to the fees charged on portable sets. Additional licence fees are charged on portable sets for some technical reason which existed at the beginning of the broadcasting.  It was thought desirable to charge an additional fee for portable sets.  The position has been reconsidered in view of the increased number of portable sets in use, with the result that the Department recommended to the Department of Finance that a demand for two licence fees from one person in regard to a portable set should not be made in future.  We have secured the consent of the Department of Finance in that respect, and I hope shortly that only one fee will be charged in regard to portable sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made a number of suggestions, particularly with regard to alterations in the programme arrangement.  I want to say that I appreciate the amount of interest that Deputy Briscoe has taken in the matter.  To a certain extent it has been a helpful interest.  While I do not agree with a great many of his criticisms, I still think that criticisms <Col N="2107" /> of that kind are helpful, and I only wish that other Deputies would take a similar interest in our activities.  I do not agree, however, that an advisory association of listeners is a thing that is feasible or desirable.  It is generally conceded that you cannot get consensus of opinion in regard to the programme that the public really want.  Listeners will disagree among themselves.  The best you can hope for is that those who are in charge of the station will endeavour to find out through the various channels at their disposal&mdash;the letters which they receive, personal communications and conversations with people who take an interest in the matter&mdash;the programme that they consider the most acceptable generally.  Having ascertained the type of programme which they consider is the most acceptable to the general public, they must not always be prepared to give them exactly what they want.  I think it should be the policy of those in charge of the power station to keep a step or two ahead of the desire of the general public in regard to the type of entertainment they are looking for.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that we have an Advisory Committee, and that an attempt was made to make it representative of as many sections of the public as possible, including listeners.  The Advisory Committee is therefore representative of listeners, and I do not see any reason why a special committee of listeners should be set up to give us advice. At the same time, I see no objection to a committee or association of any class of listeners discussing programmes and making recommendations. I assure the Deputy that very serious consideration will be given to any recommendations coming from them.  I would also suggest that it would be well for listeners to set up local debating and listening societies.  If they are prepared to do that we would be willing to co-operate with them and try to put on items on programmes that would suit debates and discussion in these local societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> Deputy Briscoe was anxious to know whether, from the number of licences issued, we had any information as to the number of valve sets and crystal sets in use now as compared with the previous years. All the information we have is to the effect that 25,269 licences were issued last year.  Of that total 17,183 were in respect of value sets and 8,086 were for crystal sets, the respective percentages being 68 for valve sets and 32 for crystal sets. Last year was the first year in which these figures were taken, and for that reason it is impossible to present a comparative statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether it would be possible to get such figures.  Deputy Briscoe referred to the decrease in the number of crystal set users and the increase in the number of valve set users, and asked if any explanation could be given for that.  It is very difficult to give a reason for that, but the fact is that there was a slight decrease in the number of crystal set users.  The general tendency amongst listeners-in appears to be to start with a crystal set, and when they have been using that for some time to drop it and get a valve set.  That practice, I think, brings about the situation that in proportion to the total number of licences issued the number for crystal sets will be less than the number for valve sets.  Our estimates in the future will not be based altogether upon the present number of licences.  We must take into consideration, of course, the conditions that exist in other countries.  In porportion to population, the number of licences taken out here are <Col N="2109" /> less than the number taken out in other countries.  For Northern Ireland the figure is 24 per 1,000 of the population; in Denmark 88 per 1,000 of the population, and in Great Britain 67 per 1,000 of the population.  We think that we are fairly safe in the estimate we have made as to the number of licences that will be taken-out here when the high-power station is established.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe's suggestion that there should be a general director for all classes of broadcasting, the one man being responsible for the musical as well as for the other portions of the programme, is not one which, I think, could not be accepted, because specialised knowledge is required in our musical director.  Our musical director is not only responsible for all the musical items in the programme, but also for the training of the members of the orchestra as well as of the artistes who take part in important items such as symphony concerts and operas.  A great deal of his time is taken up with work of that kind.  Such a man must necessarily have a specialised musical training.  It does not follow that a man with specialised musical knowledge would also be the most capable man in other directions.  In passing, I think it is only right that I should express appreciation of the very valuable work that has been done by our present musical director who, while only a part-time official, is giving a great deal of his time to the musical side of the station programme.  I think there is a general feeling that that side of our programme has been very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also asked a question with regard to the news assistant. The position in that matter is that we had a temporary news assistant employed up to some months ago when we entered into an arrangement which we believe is likely to result in a more satisfactory news supply.  That system is being tried at present.  The amount which the new system is likely to cost is shown in the vote.  It is approximately the same as what the old arrangement cost.  We believe <Col N="2110" /> that our news item has improved as a result of the change made.  I do not say that in any sense that could be construed as derogatory of the work done by the former news assistant. What I do say is that the present system is more satisfactory than the one we had in the past.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the decision to establish a high power station has met with the general approval of the Dáil.  Deputy Briscoe seemed to be of the opinion that we had actually selected a site for the station and that the cost of it was included in the Estimate.  If the Deputy looks at sub-head E he will find that it does not mention the cost of a site at all.  As a matter of fact the site has not yet been selected.  Various places have been inspected, but personally I have not yet seen the reports of the inspectors who made those inspections.  One consideration, but not the main consideration with us, is that we should get a suitable site costing the least possible sum.  With that consideration in mind, we naturally look out for a site on some Government property. The inspections that have taken place so far have been in towns where Government property, which would be available, exists.  That does not mean that we are tied down definitely to accepting a site on Government property.  It is quite possible, but not probable, that because of other reasons we may find it necessary to get a site that is not on Government property.  The present position is that the whole matter with regard to the site is still open for decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to unfavourable comment on the plays we are broadcasting at present.  He suggested that plays produced in the Abbey might be broadcast.  Personally I am inclined to express the opinion that perhaps the weakest spot in our programme are those radio plays.  Some of them, I believe, are good but quite a number are not first class.  It must be remembered that the circumstances with regard to the broadcasting of drama are peculiar.  We are constantly putting on new plays.  That <Col N="2111" /> is because, in the case of a broadcasting station, you cannot repeat plays time and again.  You must put on new plays almost every time. It should be remembered, too, that for broadcasting purposes the play must generally be written specially. The remuneration for the production of broadcasting plays is not very large, particularly in this country, and consequently our choice is rather restricted.  We are paying special attention to that matter.  We hope that, by insisting on thorough rehearsals and so on, to be able to produce a better type of play in the future.  I believe that negotiations are being entered into with regard to the broadcasting of Abbey plays. Deputy Fahy suggested that some of the Feis Ceoil prize-winners might be got to broadcast.  Speaking from memory, I believe it was the custom for those taking part in the Feis Ceoil prize-winners' concert to broadcast.  I think that was done last year, but I am not sure whether arrangements have been made to have that done this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I suggested was that those who get first or second prizes at the Feis Ceoil might be invited to broadcast and be heard more frequently than at present if their fees are not too high.  I know, of course, that in the financial sense some of them have exaggerated ideas of their own importance.</P>

      <P>We do not select our artistes solely because of the fact that they happen to have been Feis Ceoil prize-winners, but on examination I think it would be found that many of our artistes first won distinction as Feis Ceoil prize-winners. I undertake to give consideration to the suggestion made by Deputy Fahy in the matter of getting Irish singers from Galway to broadcast.  Deputy Goulding also mentioned that the reception was not always good.  There are certain technical difficulties with regard to reception in Galway and other places, including Co. Waterford. The establishment of the high power station will remove these difficulties. <Col N="2112" /> Some Deputies have complained that they cannot get any station but Dublin. Waterford will be in a very satisfactory position when the high power station is established because it is in a suitable part of the country in relation to the high power station.</P>
      <P>As to the quality of the programme and the amount of time given to the various items, an interesting point was mentioned by Deputy Thrift in regard to the educational side of the programme. Deputy Thrift suggested it was unwise to mix the educational features with the entertainment side, and he considered that the educational parts of the programme should not be put on when the people were anxious to listen to the entertainment items.  Deputy Thrift is to a large extent correct in that, but on examination it will be found that the educational items are put on before the entertainment side begins. For instance, the language lessons are on at 6.30 or 7 o'clock.  Generally speaking, we put educational subjects on at an hour when people are not listening-in for entertainment. The educational programme is a wide one.  Many things may be educational without being definitely so described.  I believe that talks on certain subjects are education to an extent.  I hold that in so far as the educational value of broadcasting is concerned people receive education and instruction without being conscious of the fact, and so far as the definitely educational items are concerned they take up but a small part of the time allotted to the programme. I am not now dealing with programmes for school hours.  That is a matter which is being considered by the Department I represent and the Department of Education.  As to Deputy Goulding's suggestion with regard to confining such a programme to secondary schools, it has not been started in any schools so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made unfavourable comment on the language lessons, and favourable comments were made by Deputy Goulding.  We do not think that the language lessons <Col N="2113" /> in themselves are sufficient to enable any person to learn a language, and we consider that such lessons are only supplementary to other efforts to acquire a knowledge of a language. It is quite obvious that that is so when regard is had to the amount of time devoted to the subject, the method of instruction, and considering that there can be no conversation between the instructor and the listener, but we believe that such lessons are very helpful as a supplementary part of language studies.  We do not know to what extent they are followed.  We are prepared to cut out some of the present language lessons if there is a general consensus of opinion they are not acceptable.  Deputy Gorry and Deputy Aird are anxious to have a broadcasting station in Offaly, but, as they can gather from my general remarks, the whole question of a high-power station is still a matter for decision.</P>

      <P>Am I to take it from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that listeners, whether individuals, groups, or societies, will be able to make representations to him, that they will be considered, and that where definite disapproval of certain items and certain programmes is expressed that will be considered?  I appreciate the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary accepted the criticism I made in the matter, but I hope he will not think badly of me when I say that I am in hopes that his idea of broadcasting entertainment does not coincide with his idea of education.  He says that persons receive education without being aware of the fact.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has ascertained what the effect of the establishment of the high power station will be as regards the reception <Col N="2114" /> of foreign stations.  Will that high power station definitely shut out all stations but the one?  There are many people who like to hear foreign stations.  Some of them have extremely fine programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Briscoe, I may mention that we are under a disadvantage in regard to educational and entertainment items, as we have only one station. It is generally accepted that where financial considerations allow there ought to be two stations, so that the listeners can change from one programme to another&mdash;that is, if there are educational items on one programme those who do not want them can turn to the other and vice versa. Owing to our financial resources being restricted, we are limited to one station and, therefore, we have to compromise on this matter.  In reply to Deputy Wolfe's question, with regard to the effect of the high power station, that is a matter to which we have given consideration. Within a radius of ten or fifteen miles of the high power station it will be very difficult for listeners with any kind of a set to get an outside station, but taking into consideration the fact that the radius that will be affected in that way covers a sparsely populated portion of the country the proportion of the population that will be affected will be comparatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Outside the fifteen miles' radius there will be another belt where the reception of foreign-stations can only be got with a selective set, and again outside that particular radius there will be a general radius belt where the reception of foreign stations will be as easy, and sometimes easier, than at present.  It will be easier to get foreign stations in Dublin and there will be less interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>No licence fee is charged to a blind person.  A point was raised by Deputy Goulding which I forgot to deal with.  I may say in reply to him that it is practically impossible to differentiate between a set in working order and a dismantled set.  A set may be dismantled to-day and working tomorrow. The taking down of an aerial does not mean that the set cannot be at work next week.  The person who has a set in his possession has to pay a licence fee.  People who have sets that they do not intend to use should destroy them or hand them over to some blind person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the actual Estimate is concerned there are not many changes calling for comment, and possibly the more practicable way would be, if Deputies require an explanation of any particular item, to raise the matter during the course of the discussion. Since my last review of the situation a few things have occurred to which I might call attention.  As was indicated already, we held the primary certificate examinations for <Col N="2116" /> pupils in the national schools.  About 10,000 pupils presented themselves and, I think, something like 53 per cent. or 55 per cent. passed.  Another matter is one which received a certain amount of attention.  Information had been asked as to how far the Act of 1926 has been a success in bringing about better attendance of the pupils at the schools. In that connection I may give figures, because now it seems one can judge by the figures&mdash;I do not mean to be taken as indicating that our efforts, or the efforts of those who are the enforcing authority should be relayed; on the contrary, if possible, they might be increased&mdash;that have come almost to a state of equilibrium in the matter.  It is, perhaps, too early to judge whether that is so or not, but I shall give some figures, and Deputies can form their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Take 1924 as being the year, as far as the schools are concerned, in which conditions were move or less normal.  On December 31, 1924, the average on the rolls were 498,000 and the percentage of attendance 73.5.  On June 30, 1926, when the School Attendance Act was having its effect, the average on the rolls was 518,000, and the average attendance 77 per cent.  In the following year there was pretty much the same number of pupils on the rolls, and the average attendance was 79.7 per cent.  In the next year there was a fall in the actual number of an average on the rolls to 512,000, but the percentage of actual attendance of those on the rolls increased to 82.7.  The corresponding numbers on June 30, 1929, were 507,000 average on the rolls, and the percentage of attendance was 82.6.  In the period of 9 years the percentage of attendance of those on the rolls increased from 73.5 per cent. to 82.6 per cent., or roughly an increase of 9 per cent.  It is true there has been a falling off in the total number of students in the schools, but there are a variety of explanations for that.  I think Deputy O'Connell, in a speech he delivered the day before yesterday, stated he had heard that was the fact, and said it was an unexpected <Col N="2117" /> result of the introduction of the compulsory School Attendance Act.</P>
    <P>There was a falling off last year and the year before, but I think I pointed out when the School Attendance Act was going through that that might be one of the results that could follow, that students might take up the line, when they were compelled to attend up to the age of 14, that they ought not to go to school after 14.  But there are other explanations.  The number who reach 6th Standard at the time they leave school has increased.  The fact remains that the number of pupils who go to school before six and who stay there after fourteen has decreased, but there is much more regularity in the attendance between six and fourteen, the years to which the School Attendance Act applies.  If you take the actual numbers in the schools between these ages you will find them practically steady now.</P>
    <P>Of course there are places in which the average attendance is much higher than 82.6 per cent., which I have given as being the average attendance for the country as a whole.  For instance, in County Kilkenny the average was 88.5; Waterford City, 88.1; Cork City, 87.8, and Dublin City 87.1, and in no county, except Leitrim, was it under 80.  It was 79.1 in Leitrim.  Again and again I hear figures quoted of countries where they get an average attendance of 95, 97 and 98 per cent. I wonder whether anybody who has children could understand how such a thing is possible.  I do not know.  I am not questioning the statistics.  I often wonder what the interpretation of statistics of that kind ought to be.  In education and other matters I have often heard statistics quoted from foreign lands, and I have come to the conclusion that you would have to inquire very carefully into what precisely the statistics purport to represent.  For instance, I cannot understand how you could have an average attendance over each district of 95 per cent. or 96 per cent., considering the various illnesses to which children are subject. It is quite possible, of course, where <Col N="2118" /> valid excuses are sent in that the children concerned may not be counted at all in calculating the average.  That may be a possible explanation.</P>
    <P>However, Deputies will notice that Act has been effective in bringing about a considerable improvement in the regularity of attendance of those who come under its scope.  It has had another effect which has been noticed by the inspectors throughout the country; it has affected promotion in the different schools.  There were considerable complaints that children were kept a long time in the lower standards.  The explanation given&mdash;and it looks as if it were to a large extent the proper explanation, as can be gathered now&mdash;was generally that the irregularity of attendance of those who were on the rolls led to children being kept in lower standards longer than they would have been kept if they had attended regularly.  It was pointed out on more than one occasion that the average age at which children left school in certain districts was between 11 and 12.  There has been in that respect a noticeable improvement in the last two or three years. The percentage of children in the lower standards has decreased and there has been a substantial increase in the number of children in the upper standards.  That, again, varies with the district.  There will, of course, always be a difficulty, in a country with such distances as in ours and with the methods of getting to schools that the children have to put up with in many parts, in securing absolute regularity of attendance, even when there is no illness; but there has been, as I said, a noticeable advance in the promotions; there has been an increase in the percentage of children to be found in the 5th and 6th Standards. In that respect the year 1928 showed an increase of 7 per cent. over the previous year with regard to the 5th and 6th Standards, and the year 1929 showed an increase of 10 per cent. over the year 1926.  You must remember this&mdash;and it is clearly recognised by those who are responsible for the supervision of the <Col N="2119" /> schools&mdash;the inspectors&mdash;that the effect of the School Attendance Act on the matter that I am now discussing cannot be felt for six or seven years; that it will only be when the Act is in operation for that number of years that you can say that these schools have had a reasonably regular attendance and that we have reached the normal in that respect. Therefore we can look forward with some confidence to a further increase and a further improvement in the direction to which I have referred. But as an improvement in that respect had been showing itself we thought it advisable during the year to send out a query to the inspectors for information which would enable us to deal with that rather important matter.  I have often referred to the question of the primary programme and to the changed outlook that occurs when a young person reaches the age of fourteen or so. That we have dealt with in another manner.  Our view is that on the whole a change of school might be necessary.  A similar problem probably arose in the last two years in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>It has also been realised that that problem existed in other countries. Therefore, we asked our inspectors to report on, roughly speaking, two questions, namely, how far the programme supplied sufficient food, so to speak, for the pupil between the ages of twelve and fourteen.  Is there sufficient meat in it?  Has it sufficient variety?  Is it sufficiently distinct from the programme up to twelve?  The other question was as to how far under the existing arrangements, even if the programme itself were reported on as suitable, the staffs throughout the country were capable of making the most out of the programme.  We have received the replies and we are giving them careful consideration.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think it has been acknowledged that the programme did supply sufficient matter for the pupil between the ages of twelve and fourteen.  Of course, the difficulties in the actual carrying out of that <Col N="2120" /> programme were pointed out, and I am not quite clear at the moment how these difficulties can be overcome with our present organisation. In the one-teacher school it is much more difficult, but in the average type of school that we have&mdash; namely, the two-teacher school&mdash;the question is as to how far the two teachers can give sufficient attention to pupils between twelve and fourteen. In connection with national schools I would like Deputies always to remember that the national schools here, and the practically corresponding schools in all other countries, are staffed on a very different system from that in the case of the secondary schools.  For the number of students that attend you have&mdash;and the question of cost makes it necessary that you should continue to have&mdash;much smaller staffs, and, therefore, the classes cannot be dealt with in the same way; classes have to be grouped together in a way that does not always apply in the secondary schools. These difficulties that we always have were pointed out to us.  Other countries, in which the population is concentrated more in the towns, have made efforts to deal with that problem in a different way.  The extent to which we can deal with it is a matter that will have to engage our attention in the course of the next few years.  These are some of the matters to which I wanted to refer so far as the primary system is concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of secondary schools that we recognise in the year 1929-30, and an increase in the number of pupils attending these schools.  The number of schools has increased by four &mdash;from 290 to 294&mdash;and the total number of pupils on which we pay grants has increased from 26,700 to 27,600.  Similar progress is to be marked in the case of technical education. One of the drawbacks from which that system suffered was that we had not in our training school for domestic teachers quite sufficient accommodation and we did not turn out a sufficient number of domestic <Col N="2121" /> teachers to supply the demand.  An important development for the teaching of domestic science has now taken place, that is, the conversion of the residential school of St. Catherine's at Blackrock into a training school for teachers.  Two wings were added to the existing building, and modern equipment is being installed, so that now we will have two schools catering for that particular need.  There is a shortage of teachers in what I consider is one of the most important subjects in post-primary education from the general point of view of the comfort and the economic prosperity of the country, but in that way we will be able to cope with the shortage of teachers that we actually train ourselves.</P>
    <P>The matter of the attendance at the technical schools has received attention in various quarters.  Here it will be necessary to go into a little more detail, not merely to state the total number of students attending technical schools, but also to indicate the groupings of the students in these schools.  The variety of subjects taught and the relative importance of the different subjects are so considerable that a mere publication of the actual increase in the numbers attending would not indicate whether or not progress in the full sense of the word was being made.</P>
    <P>Of course I am not suggesting that an increase in numbers itself is a criterion of advancement.  It may not be the sole criterion, but at all events it is useful where we lack other definite criteria.  Judged on this basis, the increase of numbers alone, there has been since 1924, and even since last year, a considerable increase to be noticed in the number of students attending technical schools in the country.  By last year I mean the last year for which I have complete information, 1928-29. If you take 1928-29 there is an increase of 4,000 students over the previous year, an increase of 17 per cent., or an increase, roughly speaking, from 24,500 to 28,500.  There has been an increase of 7,000 from the year 1924, an increase actually of 33 per cent., taking the year 1924 <Col N="2122" /> as the first normal year so far as the schools are concerned.  I am giving the figures of attendance at the regular technical schools.  There is, of course, other technical instruction in other centres besides the technical schools in the country, but the figures I am now giving are for technical schools in the strictest sense of the term.</P>
    <P>In that connection it may be necessary to call Deputies' attention to an answer which I gave to Deputy Good on a previous occasion, and to elaborate it a little more now, comparing the numbers of students in the year 1928-29 with those in 1924-25.  There was an increase in all the different courses.  In the introductory course there was an increase of 42 per cent., in the commerce course 24 per cent., in science, pure and applied, of 63 per cent., in handicraft of 70 per cent., in domestic science of 49 per cent., in art 25 per cent., and in other subjects 30 per cent.  We see, therefore, that not merely has there been an increase in the total number of students, but that that increase is most marked in the subjects connected with purely technical education, an advance which is of great importance.  It is specially noticeable in the case of what I might call technology.  There, if you take science pure and applied and handicraft together, you have an increase of 65 per cent. since 1924.  I could also give the actual figure.  There has been an increase similarly in most subjects in the various courses of lectures given at other centres besides technical schools.  I shall not worry you with the figures. There has been a corresponding increase on more or less similar lines there as well.</P>
    <P>Criticism has often been made&mdash;I have often made it myself&mdash;as to the amount of attention that is given to what is called commerce in the technical sense.  If you look at the figures given in the census of employment, you will see that under the heading of commerce you get one of the largest groups.  Shopkeepers and managers are given as 39,000, shop assistants and salesmen as <Col N="2123" /> 37,000, clerks 24,000 and typists about 4,500.  That is about one of the biggest groups.  I might suggest that what is wrong is not so much that too much commerce is done but that in proportion to other subjects, and the limited resources that are at present available, too much attention has been given to that particular subject.  We are gradually getting into a healthier condition as will be seen from the figures I have given.  If you compare that 24 per cent. increase you will find that it was the lowest on the whole list, much lower than in the strictly technological subjects.  What I suggest is wrong is not that there are too many facilities for this particular type of education but that there is not enough of the other type and that money which would possibly be much better spent in other directions has been devoted too exclusively to this easier side of the matter.  When you come to commerce itself and consider that clerks <Col N="2124" /> are only 24,000 and typists only 4,000 and consider the amount of attention given to these subjects, I think it will be agreed that there is undoubtedly room for improvement in comparison with the other subjects.</P>
    <P>These are the few introductory remarks I intended to make.  As a rule it is complained that the statements of Ministers in introducing estimates are much too long but generally no matter how long they are one finds that Deputies complain that they do not mention subjects which particular Deputies wish to have dealt with.  That complaint would be made in any case and I think I shall wait until these matters have been mentioned by Deputies themselves before dealing with them.</P>
