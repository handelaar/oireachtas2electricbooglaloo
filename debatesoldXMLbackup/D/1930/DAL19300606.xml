      <P>When I was comparing the treatment yesterday or the attitude of minds adopted towards different kinds of persons I suggested that they were all regarded as outlaws. Deputy O'Connell apparently misunderstood me and thought I referred to him as saying something about George Gilmore.  I wish to start off by removing any misapprehension that may be in his mind.  I am sorry he is not here, but I told him I would put it on record that I did not associate the attitude of mind towards George Gilmore with him.  The attitude somehow or another is that the law is to be applied towards some people in one way and towards others in another way.  It is to be strained against the persons who have to pay income tax, and in that matter Deputy O'Connell seems to be sympathetic and to aid and abet the severe interpretation of the law, especially against persons, who are the richer persons, who pay income tax.  And he seemed to take special pleasure, considering the troubles of those who have been forced to pay large sums of income tax.  He said that where the smaller people with <Col N="715" /> salaries have been forced to pay income tax he has not much pity upon the richer people who had also to pay income tax.  I suggest that the law must be the same for all.  If Deputy O'Connell wishes to advocate a capital levy that is a very different thing.  It should be done, however, as a direct thing and not in the dishonest way of capturing as much as they can by the inquisitorial methods of the income tax collectors.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputy O'Connell will be in before I finish because there were one or two other criticisms which I would prefer to make if he were here.  The laws of income tax are very complicated; the forms are very complicated.  Persons getting these forms and being called to pay income tax are in great trouble because of their ignorance of the law, and necessarily so.  Some of the collectors trade upon their ignorance. They ask people for more than they are entitled to ask for.  They take every advantage of lapse of time for enforcing the clauses with reference to the time limit very strictly and they ask questions which they are not entitled to ask.  There is no legal remedy for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that if the income tax collectors exceeded their legal powers there is a remedy against them.  There is no remedy against an income tax inspector who asks a man where he got his grama-phone and a number of other similar questions, which the man will probably answer because he does not know that the official is not entitled to ask such questions.  I heard of a curious instance very recently where a solicitor applied for a certificate showing that all taxes had been paid on certain property.  By law the Revenue Commissioners are bound to supply that certificate when it is applied for on the sale or purchase of a piece of property.  The application was made, there was a delay, and there was a conversation in which an official had the audacity to say that he did not believe that the property was being sold at all, and he wanted to have it proved.  One <Col N="716" /> can imagine the feelings of a solicitor, whose mind is full of the details of a particular transaction, when a red herring like that is dragged across the trail at the moment he is carrying through a sale.  Business would become impossible if at a particular stage an official could raise difficulties like that.  If the law states that such a certificate shall be given it should be given automatically when a solicitor applies for it.  A solicitor will not, for the sake of his health, ask for a certificate in respect of property about which there is no business transaction.  It is that inquisitorial attitude that is most resented, and it has a bad effect, because the drift of public opinion is unsympathetic with the collection of income tax.  It regards abuses as things that one can connive at, and that is largely due to the fact that it is felt that the collection is not being carried out in as fair-minded a manner as it should be.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about it that the absence of such an institution as special commissioners makes a very great difference, and I hope that, as an outcome of this criticism, in order to place the Revenue Commissioners in a more favourable light, in order to put them right with the community generally, the Minister will consider the introduction of legislation which will provide some impartial person between the Revenue Commissioners and the general public, or some body that would be a substitute for the Special Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are entitled to collect income tax for a period of six years; income tax due before that period is not recoverable according to the statutes.  Originally it was three years, but it has been made six years in this country.  The answer given by the Revenue Commissioners in these cases is: &ldquo;Oh, but the rest of it is in the nature of penalties.&rdquo;  It may be in the nature of penalties, but such penalties should be imposed by a judicial act and not merely as an administrative act.  They exercise a judicial power in these cases that is an excess of their powers under the Constitution. <Col N="717" /> That also will have to be cleared up by legislation, and the sooner it is done the better, because otherwise it may lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, which is not desirable.</P>
    <P>It was noticeable that when Deputy O'Connell was commenting upon the collection of income tax and was praising the Inland Revenue Commissioners he ignored altogether the case of an unemployed worker who was put into prison for not paying income tax which he could not pay.  It is an extraordinary thing that nothing should have been said by the leader of the Labour Party in reference to the position of workers of that kind.  That was not altogether an incidental or an isolated case; there have been other cases, some of which are even on record in the Law Reports, of workers who were punished in a like manner.  Perhaps Deputy O'Connell expects that by being a good boy towards the Revenue Commissioners in this matter for his own particular craft&mdash; the teachers&mdash;he will get special terms, that some kindlier interpretation of the law will be meted out in their case in future.  At the same time, I do not think it is fair for a person in the position of leader of the Labour Party to sacrifice the workers or the country generally in the interests of his own craft.  Possibly his attitude of almost uncritical support of the Revenue Commissioners will lead to their being even more severe with the teachers than they have been.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the majority of those in the Department of the Revenue Commissioners want to do the best they can by the country, and that part of their defects in the carrying out of the law is due to the law itself, but there is also a spirit of bureaucracy there which in the end militates against the collection of the tax rather than assisting in its collection by creating a public opinion insisting that everybody ought to pay the tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell stated yesterday that he noticed I was smiling during Deputy Wolfe's <Col N="718" /> speech.  I assure the House that I did smile, but it was not for the reason that Deputy O'Connell thought.  The reason I was smiling was because of the exceedingly emphatic way in which Deputy McDonogh agreed as to the accuracy of Deputy Wolfe's statements. There have been allusions to the cleaning of the Augean stables of the Income Tax Department. I have had considerable experience of civil servants in the Estate Duty Office and in the Income Tax Department.  They are on the whole, exceedingly courteous officials, hardworking and by no means well paid, but it is regrettable that an exceedingly small percentage of them were not drowned when they were born.  However, that percentage is very small.</P>
      <P>There is one case that I wish the Minister to take note of, the case of a small income taxpayer who derives his income from a shop and from land.  I will not mention any names but I suggest, sir, that you are the owner of a small shop in the country, not in a village but on a country road, and that you are also the proud possessor of a wife and four children.  You were directed by the income tax people to make a return of your income.  You know that the profits from the shop consist entirely of the difference between the prices at which you buy from one or two wholesale houses and the prices which you can get from your customers. You know that your total annual expenditure with these wholesale houses is under £650 a year.  You estimate&mdash;and in my opinion overestimate&mdash;your income from that shop at £150 a year, and you send in your return.  About the month of October you get back a notice stating that they have assessed the profits of your shop at £250, that they have deducted £25 earned income allowance and £225 for your wife, and that there is no income tax to be paid, but that if you desire to appeal you must do so within fourteen days.  Why should you appeal when you have no income tax to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> About the following January you get a notice informing you that there is £2 4s. 10d. income tax on your land to be paid.  That amount is correctly arrived at by taking your Poor Law valuation and deducting the balance of your allowances for the children.  You point out that that is all right but that they have already charged you with £250 profits on an outlay of £650, instead of the excess estimate of £150 that you put in.  The answer you get to that is that you did not appeal, that the time has passed, and that you must pay the £2 4s. 10d. You consult somebody, I will not say who.  He interviews the Income Tax Department and they tell him that the £2 4s. 10d. must be paid because you did not appeal.  After some more argument the inspector says: &ldquo;I am prepared to reconsider this if you send in certified accounts.&rdquo; But if you have paid the £2 4s. 10d. you will not get it back. You must now employ a chartered accountant to make up your accounts at a cost of three guineas to get off paying the £2 4s. 10d., provided you have not already paid it. You can produce your bank book, showing that on 1st January you had £74 16s. 3d. to your credit and that on 31st December you had £35 11s. 3d., and you can prove that your stock is practically the same on 31st December as it was on the previous 31st December&mdash;not that that evidence will be accepted by the inspector, apparently, because he requires certified accounts.  That system is not fair to the small man who is trying to rear a family&mdash;he has now five&mdash;and who is quite prepared to pay anything that he is legally liable for.  The whole difficulty is that when the officials are sending out assessments for Schedule D they do not send assessments for Schedules A and B, and consequently the unfortunate small man has no reason to appeal against an assessment on which he has nothing to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Leonard as to <Col N="720" /> the position of many small taxpayers. There are many women running small businesses in the country towns and they keep no accounts. They simply keep a bank book and they do not take stock or balance their accounts.  They live on from year to year, making whatever they can out of their small business.  These women, when summoned before the Commissioners, do not understand their position very often and they make absurd statements, giving themselves credit for receipts that they never had.  Some effort should be made to facilitate these people and prevent them from being victimised, as I am afraid some of them are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that pressure is being brought to bear on the Revenue Commissioners to restrict the importation of second-hand motor cars from England.  We are sending a tremendous amount of money out of this country for motor cars.  It is possible to purchase in England second-hand cars in good condition that are quite safe to use and that can be obtained fairly cheaply.  I am told that in many cases the Revenue authorities refuse to accept the invoice price of these cars, that they insist on putting a valuation of their own on the cars in excess of the prices paid for them and that every effort is made to hamper their importation. It is not fair that men who cannot afford to pay for new cars and who have to make their living out of the cars they buy by hiring them out should be compelled to pay a tax in excess of the price they actually paid for the cars.  Instead of being hampered, they should be facilitated, because we should endeavour to reduce our expenditure on motor cars.  The materials for the cars are made outside the country, so the country derives no benefit from the purchase.  In the first place, we pay out the capital cost of the car. Then we have to send out money for everything the car uses&mdash;petrol, oil and so forth.  Every effort should be made to reduce that expenditure Instead of trying to thwart the <Col N="721" /> people who endeavour to economise in the use of motor cars, we should do everything to facilitate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Goulding, in speaking of the pressure which has been brought to bear on the Revenue Commissioners, refers to representations which have been made to them with regard to the importation of second-hand cars, he is wrong in his information.  These representations were not made with the view of prohibiting or even impeding the importation of second-hand cars. They were made only with a view to ensuring that the assessment of these cars for import duty would be carried out on a proper basis.  Anybody who knows how the business is carried on is aware that there is plenty of room for fraud with regard to the invoice prices for such cars. A great deal of personal negotiation goes on in London and other cities where these cars are bought.  Very often it is the easiest thing in the world to arrange that bogus invoices be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor cars, after all, are not like razor blades, or things of that kind, which can be made up in packets and sold at fixed prices.  There is such an excess of these cars in London and other places that a particular dealer is very often quite eager to make a bargain with an Irishman and to facilitate him in getting the car imported even at a much lower price than he has paid for it.  The representations that were made to the Revenue Commissioners were made with a view to ensuring that a proper check would be kept on values, because there are other interests&mdash;interests which represent a very big capital investment&mdash;which would be seriously affected by the too liberal importation of second-hand cars.  I do not express any opinion on the general question as to whether or not it is more desirable to import second-hand cars than to import new cars.  But I think, in justice to the revenue and in justice to the very big business interests concerned, these representations were justified.  I believe they have had a very good effect.  I do not think the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="722" /> can attain to such a position that they will be satisfied that frauds such as I have referred to are not being carried on.  But I know that since the representations that Deputy Goulding referred to were made there has been a great deal more efficiency with regard to the assessment of cars for import duty purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two cases to which I desire to refer&mdash;one illustrating the tendency of the Revenue Commissioners to chance their arm, and the other, a case of what I would consider harsh treatment.  In the first instance, a gentleman got a demand for income tax on £100 retainer fee which he was alleged to have from a certain association.  He never had such a fee.  He wrote across the form, &ldquo;Who the devil told you that yarn?&rdquo; He got a reply that the form had been incorrectly filled.  He has heard nothing further about the matter.</P>
      <P>In the second case, a decree was given by the County Court Judge for £22,000 against a County Council which had determined not to honour any decree for damage done by the Crown forces.  The owner of the decree died during the Truce, leaving no assets.  I might say that he died a homeless wanderer.  His house had been burned, his business had been destroyed, his connection had gone and his sons were out with a flying column.  I am sure that that is not a case which Deputy O'Connell would reckon as amongst those of the affluent shirkers and artful dodgers of income tax.  The amount awarded by the Shaw Commission in 1924 was £16,000.  The Revenue Commissioners now claim that the value of the assets for their purpose is £16,000.  If there is any case in which leniency should be shown, I submit this is one.  This is the case of a man whose business was destroyed. Who died as a result of the hardship he underwent and whose sons were out with the fighting columns of the I.R.A.  Now they want to regard his business as worth £16,000, when the decree against the County Council was not worth twopence in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="723" /> refer to a case that was brought under my notice some time ago.  It is a case of small contractors who are using certain machines.  A doubt arose as to whether they were liable to licence duty or not.  The Inland Revenue authorities had also a doubt about the matter, because these machines were being operated for one and a-half years or two years before any licence duty was claimed. In order to test the matter, and have the question settled, they asked the Revenue Commissioners to bring a test case before the courts.  The Inland Revenue authorities refused to bring one test case, but slapped 480 summonses against these people. The legal advisers of these people told them that they had a very good case, and would be justified in defending the test case, but that they could not advise them to take the risk of defending 480 summonses. The obvious intention of the Inland Revenue authorities was to stampede these people into paying the licence duty, about which there was a good deal of doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, there was not really any doubt as to the legal liability in the case to which Deputy Mathews refers.  But there were certain difficulties regarding detection, and steps were taken a year ago to remove those difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little mentioned a particular case.  I should like Deputy Little to send me particulars of that case, so that I could have it looked into.  It is impossible to deal with individual cases in the Dáil, because there is no justification for speaking here about the private affairs of individuals.  Even if the Deputy has the particulars, I have not got them and I have no means of getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Dáil admired Deputy Jasper Wolfe's performance.  I regard it as a great effort, such as he would make in court.  He resorted to the well-known device of the advocate whose case is weak&mdash;pouring a fair amount of abuse on the other side.  In the earlier part of his speech he gave the impression that the whole of the working population <Col N="724" /> of the State was being put in jail in instalments by the Revenue Commissioners, and was being left to languish there for lengthy periods. Since 1st July last, the total number of people who have been put in jail in connection with non-payment of income tax is ten.  Of these ten, three were released on the day of arrest; four were released on the day after arrest; one was kept four days; one was kept six days, and one was kept fifteen days.  The man who was kept fifteen days was possibly the only one of the lot who was unable to pay.  As a matter of fact, he was arrested as the result of local action, without the direction of the Commissioners. I cannot identify the working men to whom Deputy Wolfe referred, though I believe he has made the two appear four by repeating the cases this year, having dealt with them last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. J.T. Wolfe Mr. J.T. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated there were only two.  The Minister has already had particulars of the cases and he knows them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy dealt with that before.  In one case that, I think, was referred to by the Deputy, a man who owed £18 was arrested.  It is a fact that that man was out of employment at the time of his arrest, but he had £500 of his own in British War Loan; he owned a house the valuation of which was £42, and his wife was carrying on a business.  It is all very well to come here and talk about unemployed men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt again, that is not so.  There is no use in shying statements of that sort about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be one of the cases to which the Deputy referred. It is a County Cork case, and it seems to be the one and only one that will fit the description the Deputy gave.  In any case, this man was out of employment.  It is the sort of case about which we hear a great deal of talk and in consequence of which we hear the Revenue Commissioners held up to odium.  That man owed £18 tax.  He was perfectly <Col N="725" /> well able to pay it in spite of the fact that he happened to be at the moment out of employment.  I do not think the Revenue Commissioners would have been entitled to do anything else than to take the steps necessary to recover the money. Another of the ten cases mentioned in which imprisonment was resorted to was that of a commission agent for an English firm.  He owed the Revenue £300.  He was perfectly well able to pay, but had no goods on which distraint could be made. He was, in fact, openly laughing at the attempts to make him pay.  When he was arrested he paid promptly.  It was one of the clear cases in which an arrest could be made.  During the period from 1st July last there were ten individuals out of 70,000 taxpayers subjected to arrest and imprisonment. Of these ten, three were released on the day of arrest, four the next day, one had four days, one had six days and one had fifteen days in jail.  There is nothing there to justify all the purple patches to which the Deputy treated us.</P>
      <P>With regard to the excise cases about which we also had so many tears, in the last twelve months there have been nine cases of imprisonment in connection with excise penalties&mdash;entertainments duty and betting duty.  Of these nine cases one was in jail for six days, another was in jail for fifteen days, another for six weeks&mdash;the penalty was £500, mitigated to £125&mdash;another was in jail for six days, another for seven weeks&mdash;the penalty was £3,000, mitigated to £750&mdash;another was in jail for five weeks&mdash;the penalty was £500 mitigated to £125&mdash;another was in jail for two days, another for fourteen days and another for eleven days.  Yet we have all this talk about people being thrown into jail and kept there in perpetuity. All this talk about people being kept for life in jail because of non-payment of penalties is the most utter rubbish.  Whatever defects there may be in connection with the collection of revenue, they are not helped by these entirely exaggerated notions that are spread abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case was referred to by Deputy <Col N="726" /> Wolfe yesterday where a District Justice complained merely because a recommendation of his to mitigate a penalty had not been acceded to. The particular Justice seems to have made a personal matter of that and seems to be carrying on a certain sort of propaganda in connection with the legal powers the Revenue Commissioners have in this matter. As a matter of fact there was nothing at all in that case.  The man who was fined for evasion of entertainment duty had committed offences in 1923, at a time when prosecutions could not take place.  Applications&mdash;repeated applications&mdash; had been made to him to pay the duty and it was not possible to get the duty.  He was then convicted for an offence in 1925 and it was when he was convicted for that offence in 1925, and when he pleaded ignorance of the law and various other things, that the Justice recommended the penalty should be mitigated to £12 10s. by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Commissioners, having information about the man which was not before the District Justice, refused to mitigate the penalty, and in my opinion they rightly refused.  The District Justice, when an application was made to him later on for the issue of the body warrant, stated that if, at the hearing of the case, the previous record of the defendant as regards the evasion of the tax had been brought to his notice, he probably would not have made the recommendation that he did make. The District Justice, in appearing before the Committee the other day, seems to have forgotten that. He recommended on the body warrant that the man should not be kept more than four months in jail. As a matter of fact the man was released in three months.  There is really nothing at all in the case with which Deputy Wolfe tried to harrow us.</P>
    <P>In another part of his statement Deputy Wolfe talked about the way priests were being dragged before the Revenue Commissioners.  The practice of the income tax authorities <Col N="727" /> for several years past has been that if the return made by any clergyman appears to be anything like right on the face of it, no question is asked; no question is raised and there is no attempt to prove that the amount ought to be £25 or £50 more than it actually was.  If the return is such that anybody could accept it as having been made with a clear understanding of what the return was, there is no question in regard to it.  There are people in the country who still seem to have the opinion that income is the amount you have over after paying your living expenses during the year, and when a return is made showing an income of £50 or something like that, it is not accepted. There have been cases, and there are cases still coming in, where people make returns on that basis. When that is done it is questioned. Where a return is made obviously by a man who understands the nature of the return he is making there is no question asked at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little raised a case about a bishop.  I have not the particulars of the case, but I understand that what happened was that an application for this allowance was not made in due time.  The time for appeal had passed and the Revenue Commissioners were powerless in the matter.  There was at least a case of that sort where simply nothing could be done at all.  You must have some cases of that sort when you are dealing with 70,000 taxpayers and when you are dealing with all the complexities involved in income tax administration.  You must have fixed periods in which people can appeal.  If you extend the dates, administration would be impossible; every detail of procedure would be dragged out, large numbers of taxpayers would be lodging appeals at the end of six months and the whole thing would be so delayed that the collection of tax would be impossible.  Deputy Little made a great deal of the unconstitutional action of the Revenue Commissioners and of the Special <Col N="728" /> Commissioners.  He reminded me of a story that I read somewhere about a man in one of the State legislatures in America who was always talking of the unconstitutional procedure taking place.  Somebody told a story which really threw a certain light on his attitude of mind.  The story was that of a farmer who was sitting in his kitchen somewhere in America.  Looking up into a tree outside the door he saw a squirrel. He brought down his gun, carefully took aim and fired.  The squirrel remained there.  He fired the second barrel and yet the squirrel remained there.  He was greatly astonished and he called his son and asked him to look up at the squirrel.  The son looked up into the tree and he said that he could see no squirrel.  The father made him look into the tree again but yet the son could not see any squirrel.  He looked up at his father and said: &ldquo;There is no squirrel in the tree, daddy, but there is a flea on your eyebrow.&rdquo;  The unconstitutionalism that we have heard so much about is really in Deputy Little's mind and it cannot be applied to the Revenue Commissioners at all.</P>

      <P>The Special Commissioners are not appointed by the Revenue Commissioners.  They are not subject to the Revenue Commissioners. They very frequently decide against the Revenue Commissioners. I am told that in nearly half the cases the decisions of the Special Commissioners are either entirely against the Revenue Commissioners or partly against them. Neither the Special Commissioners nor the Revenue Commissioners, as Deputy O'Connell points out, have <Col N="729" /> any interest in persecuting the taxpayer. They have nothing to gain by it.  The only thing that could result from persecution of the taxpayer or straining the law against him would be that they would incur enmity.  Bodies engaged in straining the law would inevitably overstep the law and would render themselves liable to pains and penalties of various kinds.  The duty of revenue staffs is a duty conscientiously carried out; it is the duty of simply administering the law fairly and doing justice between one taxpayer and another.  If they took up any other line they would be entirely wrong.  I dare say that sometimes there may be something like unconscious harshness.  It will arise in this way: If a taxpayer has made a series of false statements, has supported them by all sorts of returns and documents which are not accurate, and when the case is examined makes false verbal statements of all kinds, as generally happens, it may be that when that man does ultimately tell the truth the officials will believe that he is not telling the truth.  I admit that might happen occasionally.  If a man does all the things one finds done in these cases, and does them over a period of years and tries to deceive and fool the officer dealing with the case in every way in which he can deceive and fool him, then it is inevitable that when the man does tell the truth the official will think that he is still trying to put up some sort of a false story.  There may be unconscious harshness in that way, but that is the only way in which it would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talked about a torture chamber, blood sucking and all that sort of thing.  He referred to the businesses that were ruined. Of course Deputy MacEntee delivered a prepared statement and when he prepares his speech he always becomes lyrical so that he was bound to exaggerate very considerably.  It is the fixed policy of the Commissioners, no matter what tax is owing, not to extract so much as would put a man out of business and not to <Col N="730" /> take from him his working capital, but to leave him in a position where he can carry on his business.  In many cases, owing to losses which have occurred in recent years, that involves the sacrifice of large amounts in taxes.  It is also the custom in these instances, where a case is made, to allow payment by instalments, and there are a very large number of cases where people have been helped over difficulties in which the trade slump had put them by this method of easy payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe referred to an estate duty case.  It is not the custom to charge stock plus retail profit.  I believe there was a case in which the Deputy was engaged in which an official proposed to put a higher value on stock than was reasonable, but that was adjusted.  It is not the practice of the Commissioners to value stock at retail price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the written ruling of the Commissioners so that the Minister could not say it was only my recollection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>What is laid down is what the goods would fetch if prudently disposed of in the open market or something like that.  That seems to be an absolutely fair basis on which to value stock.  There are many cases in which the cost price would represent the fair value of the stock, but there are also many cases in which it would not represent the fair value.  Take, for instance, whiskey which had been kept in bond for a considerable period.  In that case the cost price would not really represent the value of the stock at the time of decease.  So that, while there are cases in which the cost price would represent the value, there are other cases in which it would not.  I agree with the Deputy to this extent, that the retail price would be above the value of the stock, because there are factors in the retail price, such as labour costs, delay, perhaps deterioration, and various other things, which should not be taken into account, but the basis which the Deputy read out is, <Col N="731" /> I think, the basis that has always been adopted, and it is a fair basis.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point as to English probate referred to by the Deputy, I think he said that in the case of a person domiciled in England the costs of probate here were allowed.  If that is so, I am of opinion that the costs of English probate should be allowed here.  I am quite clear on that, that the treatment given to people domiciled here should not be harder.  I have not, however, had an opportunity of looking into that case.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies spoke of difficulties arising through the complexity of the income tax system.  Undoubtedly, hardships arise occasionally through the complexity of the system.  The ordinary person has a certain difficulty in understanding and filling forms.  That can only be rectified by a simplification of the law.  A committee is sitting at present which has gone a considerable distance in the examination of a variety of proposals for the simplification of the code.  Last year we took a small step towards that simplification.  The changes made by last year's Finance Act provided for a good deal of simplification in many cases.  We are anxious to proceed with simplification, so far as it can be done without loss of revenue, or with only a small loss.  There are certain measures of simplification which could easily be adopted if we could afford to lose half a million or so of revenue.  We could alter the code very substantially if we could afford to lose a good amount of revenue.  Without that big loss of revenue, however, we believe that a good deal of simplification can be introduced which will remove certain hardships and difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the Commissioners taking a sympathetic view of cases where hardship occurs in that way, or where it occurs through some inadvertence on the part of the taxpayer.  I know that many cases have been sympathetically dealt with.  Perhaps there have been cases where a particular official took a <Col N="732" /> more rigid view of the law than another would.  As I pointed out in another connection, that can hardly be avoided.  Certainly no instructions can be issued to officials definitely to strain the law.  They may lean as far as they can towards the taxpayers in hard cases, but we cannot tell them to give an untenable interpretation to the law in any case. If that were to be done, great evils would creep into the public service.</P>
    <P>It is a great thing to have an absolutely upright and trustworthy public service so that you can know that the law is being administered conscientiously, that no favour is being given, that no bribes are being taken, or anything of that kind.  If, by regulation or instruction, we were to try to induce officials to be otherwise than impartial and to administer the law fairly, if we were to instruct them to strain the law and to overlook particular facts in income tax cases, we would possibly be opening a door to the growth of evils which might be very hard to eradicate.  While revenue officials have in recent years been asked to give every possible consideration to the situation of those liable for large sums of tax, and to mitigate, as far as they can within the law, the hardship which may fall upon such people, they still must be bound by the law.  Deputies have spoken of the Revenue Commissioners asking questions that they are not entitled to ask.  They are entitled to ask nearly any question in the investigation of cases, but the taxpayer is not bound to answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say they would not say there is no such thing as an indiscreet question.  What happens when people meet face to face to discuss a case is that in the course of the discussion and argument many questions will be asked which would not be asked on a form, and would not even be asked in a letter.  If people meet to thresh out the facts of the case, it is quite proper that any question that will help to throw light on the facts should be asked. If the taxpayer is not bound to answer, he need not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take up the position that no mistakes have ever been made by the Revenue administration.  There are bound to be mistakes.  In the early years, the Revenue administration here laboured under great difficulties because there was this great <Col N="734" /> mass of arrears to be dealt with and there was a very definite shortage of trained staff, owing to the fact that we were unable to induce a sufficient number of income tax inspectors in the British service to transfer here.  The whole administration laboured under great difficulties because of the shortage of a trained staff and the inexperience of the new staff and also because of the destruction of records and the arrears.  It is quite possible that there might have been some matter now and again that did not receive absolutely adequate consideration in these years, but the staffs are now adequate for the work and I think that we have an administration of the income tax and other codes that is as fair as it is possible to make it and that is efficient, for the purpose of doing absolute justice as between the revenue authorities and the taxpayer and as between one taxpayer and another.  Reasonable discussion of revenue administration may be very helpful and may bring grievances and difficulties to light which can be remedied, but I think that the type of discussion in which Deputies Wolfe and MacEntee participated is entirely useless.  It was largely a flood of abuse and would not help in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy mentioned a case of death duties.  I cannot say anything about that case without having the particulars.  If the Deputy likes to write me and give me the particulars I shall see what the other side of the case is, if the Revenue Commissioners took action that seemed to be a hardship what were the legal provisions or other factors which obliged them to do it.</P>

      <P>Not at all, no more than I would be if I, as I could do in all these cases, recommended the Governor-General to remit the penalties. I have never used that power. I have never, in a single case, advised the Governor-General to remit a revenue penalty.  If I felt there was something more necessary I simply would ask the Revenue Commissioners to reconsider it.  It is not an exercise of a judicial function at all.  If you like, it is an exercise of the prerogative of mercy.</P>

I will ask the Minister to place before the House at some time in the near future the opinion of his legal advisers upon the whole question of the line of demarcation in the case of the Revenue Commissioners, whether they have power or not under the Constitution to exercise such functions as the imposing of penalties and the decision of a question of fraud.</P>

      <P>We are opposed to this Estimate, and we are opposed to it particularly on account of the provision made under sub-head N for the repayment to the British Government in respect of the ordinary and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary, for which in the Estimate the sum of £1,170,000 is to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, first of all, to direct the attention of the House to the fact that this payment is to be made, not only in respect of the disbandment pensions of the R.I.C. &mdash;that is the pensions paid to those officers and men who were actually serving with the force at the time of the Treaty&mdash; but the obligation is to be assumed, and payment is to be made in respect of the ordinary pensions as well; that is to say, in respect of those pensions which officers and men of the R.I.C. force who had retired prior to the Treaty and prior to December, 1921, became entitled to.  Whatever argument based on the Treaty may be used to justify the payment of the disbandment pensions. I would like the Minister for Finance to tell the House how the obligation to pay ordinary pensions arises.  There is not a word about these pensions in the Treaty.  There is not a word about them in the Agreement of 3rd December, 1925, which amended the Treaty.  There is nothing in any document or any <Col N="738" /> contract entered into between the Government of the Free State, on the one hand, and the Government of Great Britain, on the other, concerning these ordinary pensions, until the Ultimate Financial Settlement of March, 1926.  That settlement and that agreement, as we know, was signed in secret, and for over six months was kept secret.  Either from a sense of shame or a consciousness of utter inability to do so, it has never been fully and satisfactorily justified in this House.  Under Head 11 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement the Minister for Finance, of his own volition and in his own discretion, agreed to saddle the country with an obligation in respect of those ordinary and disbandment pensions in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State Government agree to repay to the British Government 75 per cent. of the pensions and compensation allowances payable to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary under the Constabulary Acts, subject to the exception mentioned in Article X of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first thing to be noted about this agreement is that its terms differ substantially from Article X of the Treaty.  The exact words of that Article are: &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of the police forces and other public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Article X of the Treaty which I have just recited referred to and can be applied only to such members of the police forces as might be actually serving at the moment when those forces were taken over by the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>The 11th Head of the Ultimate Financial Settlement dealt entirely, so far as I can see, with the cases of those men who had retired prior to the signing of the Articles of Agreement and applied to them irrespective of the date of their retiral or <Col N="739" /> discharge.  In my judgment, interpreting the Article as I have read it, it would seem to me to confine itself entirely to those who retired, as I have said, prior to the signing of the Articles of Agreement.  It is quite possible that the Minister may, by virtue of that 11th Head of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, also attempt to justify his payment of the disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  But they are two distinct classes of pensions, in my opinion, and at the moment I am dealing not with the disbandment pensions but with the ordinary pensions.  What justification can the Minister advance to this House for accepting liability in the name of the people of the Twenty-Six Counties for the ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary? Whatever burdens Article X of the Treaty which I have just read might be thought to impose upon us quite clearly it did not impose any responsibility, obligation or liability in respect of ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who retired prior to the date of the Treaty. Is there any member on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who has any doubt about that, is there any member who is aware of the terms of Article X of the Treaty, has any doubt in his mind whatever that that Article did not impose any obligation upon this State for payment of the pensions to members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who retired prior to the date of the Treaty, some of whom may have retired so far back as 1914, 1915 or 1916?</P>

At any rate, there is one thing quite clear, and that is that so far as the Treaty is concerned we had no responsibility whatsoever for the ordinary pensions of the ex-R.I.C. men.  What justification has the Minister to advance in this House <Col N="740" /> for accepting responsibility for these pensions?  The Minister relies, I think, on Article 12 of the Transfer of Functions Order, No. 315 of 1922.  In the debate on this Vote last year the Minister first of all admitted that Article X of the Treaty really provided for the protection of transferred officers.  I think that is an answer to the point which Deputy Esmonde has put to me as to what about the civil servants.  If civil servants were transferred officers then they were entitled to the benefit of Article X.  If the police were transferred officers then they were entitled to the benefit of Article X.  But if the police retired from the service of Great Britain and did not retire from the service of the Irish Free State then they were not entitled to the benefit of Article X because they were not transferred officers.  I do not think there can be any doubt about it, and the Minister's own words are there to bear me out.  But because these men were not governed and would not have had the advantage of Article X of the Treaty the Minister puts forward as a justification for paying these pensions Article 12 of the Transfer of Functions Order. What is the Article?</P>
      <P>Any property, assets, rights and liabilities connected with the functions transferred under this Order shall, if connected solely with those functions, be transferred to the Provisional Government, and if connected partly with those functions and partly with other functions shall be apportioned in such manner as may be agreed between the Governments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What validity has this Transfer of Functions Order?  The Treaty was accepted by Dáil Eireann.  It was not accepted by the Provisional Government, and what Dáil Eireann and what the people of this State are bound by under the Treaty is what was written into the Treaty and not by some subsequent irregular and illegal agreement concluded between a body calling itself the Provisional Government in subversion of the <Col N="741" /> lawful Government of the country at the time and in concealment from the people of what was being done in their name.  The document which the people&mdash;I hardly like to say accepted because the circumstances were not such as to make the acceptance a free one and it would be a misapplication of the word to say &ldquo;accepted.&rdquo;  But the Treaty so far as the people of this country submitted to it is the only document and the only agreement upon which any obligation which has since been assumed in the name of the Government of the Irish Free State can be justified to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>It is a contract with which they are familiar, in contrast to this Transfer of Functions Order which, as I say, was made behind backs, like the Ultimate Financial Settlement which was concluded afterwards. Therefore, so far as we are concerned we do not regard the Transfer of Functions Order as being effective to saddle or impose any burden on the people of this country.</P>
    <P>We will take the Minister's case, however.  The Minister justifies his attitude by the Transfer of Functions Order and cites Article 12.  But what does Article 10 of that Order say?  It says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Order shall transfer to the Provisional Government the Royal Irish Constabulary or the administration or control of that force.&rdquo; The functions of the Royal Irish Constabulary were not transferred to the Provisional Government.  The administration and control of that force, and the secondary functions of the Royal Irish Constabulary were not transferred to this country.  Therefore, because of the fact that they were not transferred we hold that Article 12, so far as the Royal Irish Constabulary is concerned, does not apply.  If the force had been transferred, if it had been taken over by the Government of the Irish Free State, then the Minister might be able to base a case on Article 12, but, since it was not transferred, since <Col N="742" /> Great Britain for its own reasons kept that force under its control, surely since we had no right, no property or no assets in the force we should have no liability for the ordinary pensions with which the Minister has saddled this country?  The Minister has been kind to the Royal Irish Constabulary, but surely it is not because he wants to relieve Great Britain of any undue burden that he is paying these pensions. Surely it is because he feels for the Royal Irish Constabulary, that he is kind to the Royal Irish Constabulary. But in all the long years since its establishment what service did the Royal Irish Constabulary force render to this country, that its members should receive such signal recognition from the Minister?  Faithful always to their salt, the great body of its officers and men allowed no call of country, no tie of kindred, no bond of pity or of mercy to deter them from carrying out the orders of their paymasters.  To them homes were not inviolate, altars not sacred, the Confessional and Communionrail not sanctified in their regard, when a rape upon the one or the desecration of the others would advance them one step in the Judas-like service which they had undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is for the pensions of men like these that the Minister for Finance has taken responsibility in the very years when he was pinching and paring and scraping away the miserable pittance which the State allows to the poorest and neediest of its aged citizens.  I say this action of the Minister in those circumstances cannot be justified, and, there, upon that ground, upon the fundamental ground of common humanity, that to the neediest should be given first, the House should refuse the amount asked for under this sub-head, and should refuse the whole amount, because there is no allocation of the moneys as between ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.</P>
    <P>So far I have confined myself to the question as to whether or not we should make repayment in respect <Col N="743" /> of ordinary pensions which this sub-head covers.  I would like the House now to consider its responsibility for the disbandment pensions in respect of which also a repayment is to be made.  How do we become responsible for these disbandment pensions?  Any responsibility we may have, that is, if we have any at all, or if the Minister can show we have any at all, arises from Article X of the Treaty.  To the words of that Article I would again direct the careful attention of the House.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to judges, officials, members of the police forces and other public servants who are discharged by it, or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Omitting all the qualifying words the Article, so far as it applies particularly to the police forces, may be read thus: &ldquo;The Government agrees to pay fair compensation to members of police forces who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Government.&rdquo; Mark the words: &ldquo;Who are discharged by it or who retire.&rdquo; These are very important words.  It is plain that they relate to the one set of persons, and in that case they also contemplate or envisage those persons under the one and the same conditions of service, and that is in the service, and in the service only of the Government of the Irish Free State.  It is obvious that the Treaty contemplated that what was then called the Government of the United Kingdom, as one of the parties to the instrument, should hand over as a going concern to the other party, that is, to the Government of the Irish Free State, the whole machinery of government in the country, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>That is the first and fundamental condition in the Agreement, and it is a condition precedent to the operations <Col N="744" /> of every other provision in the contract, for such others are secondary and consequential provisions upon that, that everything should be handed over, lock, stock and barrel.  If that primary and fundamental condition be not fulfilled in respect of any department or service of Government administration in this country, then such department or service cannot come within the scope of the secondary and consequential provisions, and accordingly the provisions of Article X cannot in any circumstances apply. This is quite clear from the words &ldquo;by it&rdquo; which are used in the phrase to which I call the particular attention of the House: &ldquo;discharged by it or who retire.&rdquo;  I hope it will be clear even to the intelligence of the Minister for Finance not to speak of the Minister for Agriculture that, quite obviously the Government of the Irish Free State could not discharge any public servant unless the service in which he was engaged had come under its control, by transfer or otherwise.  You cannot, unless you have taken a man into your service, discharge him.  Is there any doubt in the mind of any Deputy about that fact?  Unless he has come into your service he cannot retire. For instance, Deputy MacEoin could never have retired from the army of the Irish Free State unless he had first taken service under the Irish Free State.  Deputy Conlon could never have retired from the service of the Dublin Corporation unless he had first taken service under the Dublin Corporation.  I think the case I am making will be clear and plain to any Deputy that the Royal Irish Constabulary could never have retired from the service of the Government of the Irish Free State, and could never have been discharged by it unless it had been first transferred to its service and placed under its control.  That is quite clear and definite even in the Treaty.  If it had ever been contemplated that the provision of Article 10 would apply, irrespective of whether the service had been transferred to the Government of the Irish Free State or not, the phrase used in that Article would <Col N="745" /> have been &ldquo;who are discharged or who retire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that the words &ldquo;who are discharged by it or who retire&rdquo; really mean and imply &ldquo;who are discharged by it from its service&rdquo; or &ldquo;who voluntarily retire from its service.&rdquo; They certainly involve the prior entry of that person who is to have advantage of Article X, for, just as the Free State should not accept responsibility for a public servant discharged from the service of another State, neither can it accept responsibility for a public servant who retires from the service of another State.  More patent and incontestable still, it cannot accept responsibility for a public servant who is forced by that other State to retire from its service.  Bearing these facts in mind, let us investigate the position of the R.I.C. in 1922, and see whether it fulfilled the conditions which would bring its members within the scope of Article X of the Treaty.  In this connection we have to cite, first of all, the Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions) Order, which is dated the 1st day of April, 1922.  Clause 10 of this Order reads: &ldquo;Nothing in this Order shall transfer to the Provisional Government the Royal Irish Constabulary or the administration of that Force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Order, the Transfer of Functions Order, appropriately enough, considering the case which the Minister has based on it, was dated 1st April, 1922.  There is no subsequent order nullifying that reservation and transferring the Royal Irish Constabulary to the control of the Provisional, or any subsequent, Irish Government.  Until it was disbanded in 1922 the force remained completely and unreservedly under the control of the Government of Great Britain.  There may have been very good reasons for not transferring the R.I.C. to the Provisional Government, reasons of weight and substance overriding all other considerations, even the financial consequences of such non-transfer, but, if there were they were reasons which affected Great Britain only.  In view of the somewhat uncertain position <Col N="746" /> of this country at the time, and in view of the statements made here in this country by those who were in favour of the Treaty that the Treaty was but a mere stepping stone to something greater, something that would more nearly fulfil the aspirations and desires of the Irish people, those who had the force under their control might have thought that since it was a disciplined, drilled, and well-equipped force it would not be desirable to part with the administration and control of it lest the documents and records connected with it might pass into unfriendly Irish hands, or lest its members, to curry favour with their new masters, might divulge the secret history and operations of the force during the few years which preceded the signing of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the members of the R.I.C. had proven themselves in the past to be faithful to their salt.  They had been good, faithful mercenaries who served an alien Government. Possibly their British paymasters reasoned that, if the control of the salt box was to pass, this fidelity and allegiance, of which they proclaimed themselves so often proud, might pass also, and in the hands of unscrupulous men who signed the Treaty in order that shortly afterwards an Irish Republic might be established, the force might become a menace to the maintenance of English control and English administration in this country.  Therefore for these reasons, and I can think of no others, the Government of Great Britain decided not to transfer the force, and decided that so long as it existed its members should remain under the old control to receive their pay and, after disbandment, their pensions from their British paymasters. That is one of the most remarkable things about the Vote, namely, that though we provide the money it is the British who disburse the pensions.  I read a report of a speech made by Deputy Seán MacEóin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will not make personal references, but it was <Col N="747" /> stated by some members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that one of the reasons why we paid these pensions, or why a sum of £1,170,000 has to be voted, is that if Great Britain were to pay these pensions she would have in this country, under her influence and subject to her control, a certain section of the population, and that, therefore, we have to take responsibility for these pensions and have to pay them. What are the facts?  We provide the money, but it is Great Britain which disburses it.  The pensions do not come from the Irish Minister for Finance but are paid by the Chancellor of the British Exchequer.  It is a British pension warrant which the R.I.C. pensioner receives, and not a warrant from the Minister for Finance.  It is to those who send the warrant that the R.I.C. pensioner looks for his pension, and will continue to look for it, and it is from them that he would receive it, even if this Vote never appeared on the Estimate.  We in the kindness of our hearts, allow Great Britain to get it both ways.  We provide the pensions and they disburse the money.</P>
      <P>It is time that those who try to defend the payment of these pensions on Cumann na nGaedheal platforms ought, at least, make themselves aware of the basic and fundamental fact that although we pay the piper it is Great Britain who calls the tune.  Furthermore, another extraordinary fact emerges from the Vote. Although we have been paying £1,100,000 a year&mdash;it was one and a quarter millions in some years&mdash;the Minister for Finance never even had the records or the accounts of these pensions audited to see that we are not paying to Great Britain more than she disburses in pensions, to see that she is not making a profit out of the ex-R.I.C.  As I say, Great Britain, for her own reasons, kept that force under her control, and so we find that the Statutory Order which transferred most other services reserved this service to Great Britain, and it was never afterwards transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What became of the R.I.C.?  It <Col N="748" /> was disbanded in 1922 by an Act of the British Parliament.  Section 1 of that Act provides: &ldquo;The Royal Irish Constabulary shall be disbanded on such day, not being later than 31st August, 1922, as may be fixed by the Lord Lieutenant, and on or before that date every officer and constable shall retire from the force, as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant, and shall on his retirement be entitled to receive such compensation as may be awarded by the Treasury&rdquo;&mdash;the British Treasury will award the compensation, but we have to pay it&mdash;&ldquo;in accordance with the rules contained in Part I, of the Schedule to this Act.&rdquo; It is to be noted, and the point is most important, that that Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament. not even by the Parliament of Southern Ireland, and it is an Act of the British Government, and not of the Provisional Government. Secondly, it is an Act of the British Government which compulsorily retires every officer and constable from the force.  They are left no discretion in the matter, no option or election. The section definitely decrees: &ldquo;Every officer and every constable shall retire from the force as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant.&rdquo; That is all there is to it.</P>
    <P>They had to go when they were told to go, and when they were told to go in such circumstances and under such conditions, they were discharged, and discharged not by the Government of the Irish Free State, but by the British Government.</P>
    <P>To return once more to Article X of the Treaty, it is quite clear that when the words &ldquo;who were discharged by it or who retire&rdquo; were inserted in that Article that only two positions were contemplated.  The first position was that of the public servant who was discharged from its service by the new Government, and the second provision that of a public servant who of his own act and volition retired from that service. In the first case the individual had no option in the matter: he had to go; and the essence of the position lay in the coercion and compulsion which was used to make him go. <Col N="749" /> In the second case, however, the complete right resided in the individual to continue in the service of the new Government or to leave it, as he chose to elect, and the essence of his whole position was that the choice lay unreservedly with him.  But no such choice lay with the officers and constables of the R.I.C. when that force was disbanded.  They had no will, no option, no election in the matter, and therefore, whether you admit it or not, they were, in fact, discharged by the Government of Great Britain, but you must admit that they did not retire within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I think after what I have said that there is no member in this House who will get up and endeavour to make the position that they retired from the service of the Government of the Irish Free State within the meaning of Article X of the Treaty. They were compelled to retire as required by the Lord Lieutenant.  The words of the Act are quite clear and can admit of only one construction, that these officers and men were retired from the force as and when required by the Lord Lieutenant. They were discharged by the Lord Lieutenant; they were never discharged by the Provisional Government. They never entered the service of the Provisional Government, and therefore they could not retire from its service, and if they did not retire from the service of the Provisional Government how can the House be responsible for the payment to them of the compensation provided for under Article 10 of the Treaty?  How can we tax our people to provide a sum of £1,170,000 to recoup the Government of Great Britain for the pensions which she pays and has awarded to the ex-members of the R.I.C.?</P>
    <P>We heard in this House, when the Bill was introduced from these benches&mdash;a Bill which would have made easier the lot of the old age pensioners&mdash;the Minister for Finance reject that Bill and refuse to accept it on the grounds that it would involve finding an additional sum amounting to between £250,000 <Col N="750" /> and £300,000.  The House having heard arguments on both sides rejected the views put forward by the Minister, and, notwithstanding the fact that the Government Party was led by the President of the Executive Council into the division lobby against the Bill, there were sufficient fair-minded men in the House to ally themselves with this Party who had introduced the Bill, and with the Labour Party who had supported it, to carry this Bill against the Whips and the will of the present Government.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the issues on that Bill had been fairly tried out and argued in this House and a verdict in favour of that Bill had been given by this House, the President and the Executive Council preferred to resign rather than to find that sum of £300,000 to meet the Bill.  But I have shown now how this Government, who would not find a sum of £300,000 for the aged men and women who are, in fact, destitute, have found and are still prepared to find a sum of £1,170,000 to provide pensions for people who never gave an hour's service to this country or to the people of this country.  I have there submitted a case that is unanswerable.  I have shown that there is nothing in the Treaty which imposes any obligation upon us to defray any part of the pensions of the R.I.C.  I have likewise shown that the course of action which the British Government follows in regard to the R.I.C. definitely excluded its members from the benefit of Article X of the Treaty. There is no obligation in honour or equity, no obligation of contract which binds us to pay to Great Britain this sum of £1,170,000, and I ask the House, which has connived and condoned the refusal of the Government to find £300,000 for the aged poor of Ireland, to refuse any longer to condone this crime of paying away the money of the Irish people, amounting to £1,170,000, to a Government to whom it is not rightfully due.</P>

I would like if he would possibly explain to me what is the meaning of sub-head M in the Vote, and if he is also opposed to that sub-head?  Likewise, if we are not to pay the pensions of those who have retired previous to the Treaty, is the Deputy opposed to the payment of those civil servants who appear in the Post Office Vote on page 258 under sub-head N (4)? Likewise, I presume, he would be opposed to the payment of pensions to those teachers who were in the employment of the Government previous to the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considerably surprised at the attitude taken up by Deputy Esmonde, because I was personally under the impression that the members of the two big parties in this House were agreed that there was no binding obligation upon the Government of the Free State to pay those R.I.C. pensions.  The statements which have been made from time to time by prominent members of the Government Party seem to indicate that the reason why the money is being paid was, not that we were bound to pay it, but that they thought it advisable to pay it.  It should be quite obvious to those of us who have studied the question, to persons like Deputy MacEoin and the Minister for Finance, that Deputy Esmonde does not know, as Deputy MacEntee said, what he is talking about.  We took over the Post Office, the Irish teachers, the Irish Teachers' Pension Fund, and a number of civil servants.  But we did not take over the R.I.C.  I want to <Col N="752" /> get this position clarified, because the remarks of the Minister for Finance and the few remarks of Deputy Esmonde seemed to have clouded what was, to me at any rate, a perfectly clear issue.  The Deputy may remember that the Treaty was signed in December, 1921.  Those who signed the Treaty agreed to pay compensation to officials of the former Government who were transferred to the Government established by the Treaty, and who were either discharged by that Government or elected to retire from its service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position at the time the Treaty was signed.  There can be no doubt about it, if the R.I.C. had been transferred to the Provisional Government then established that the Provisional Government would have been responsible for paying the pensions or for paying some other form of compensation to any member of the R.I.C. who was discharged or retired from the police force sooner than serve the new Government.  As Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, the R.I.C. was not transferred.  It is definitely provided for that nothing in the Treaty or in any of the minor agreements that were effected subsequent to the Treaty transferred to the Provisional Government the control of the R.I.C.  The Provisional Government was established in 1922.  It proceeded to function.  The control of the R.I.C. continued to be exercised by the British Government until August, 1922, when the matter of the disbandment of the R.I.C. came under the consideration of the British Government.  At that time they introduced an Act into the British Parliament disbanding the R.I.C. and putting the responsibility for the payment of their pensions upon the British Treasury.  Let me continue the story in the words of Deputy MacEoin.  Deputy MacEoin, as reported in the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo; said, in the course of an address at Ballymahon on 19th May, that at the time of the disbandment of the R.I.C. in August, 1922, the question of the liability for pensions was an important one.  We are all agreed <Col N="753" /> about that.  Deputy MacEoin stated in Ballymahon that this question of the liability for pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement I made referred to the provisions of the Treaty, and I said that the same provisions were laid down in Document No. 2.  What happened in Ballymahon was that I read paragraph 14 of Document No. 2, which was: &ldquo;That the Government of Ireland agrees to pay compensation on terms not less favourable than those proposed by the British Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to the judges, officials, members of the police force, and other public servants.&rdquo;  What I said in Ballymahon was that Article X of the Treaty had given them these pensions and that that Article was the same as the provision made to meet the matter by Deputy de Valera in Document No. 2, but Deputy Lemass put in the Provisional Government instead of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear. I was not one of those who favoured the acceptance of the Treaty, but what I am trying to point out to the Deputy and those associated with him in his Party, is that when the Treaty was signed a liability for those pensions was not imposed upon the people of the Free State, in consequence of the fact that the Royal Irish Constabulary were never transferred to the Free State Government. This is not a Treaty question at all.  There is no question of the merits of Document No. 2 as against the Treaty involved in it.  We need not enter into that here.  If the Deputy is quite clear on that now I shall continue to quote his intelligent remarks.  &ldquo;At the time of the disbandment of the R.I.C. the question of R.I.C. pensions was an important one.&rdquo;  I am sure the Deputy will agree now also that the <Col N="754" /> question of the R.I.C. pensions is an important one and that he will not tell us he did not say that.  That is all I commit him to so far.  It is a question which involves an annual payment of £1,170,000 or about five times the sum necessary to finance the Old Age Pensions Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil.  The Deputy might not contradict me until I have committed him to something to which he does not agree.  He goes on to say &ldquo;England offered freely to pay all the R.I.C. pensions but the Provisional Government decided to refuse the offer.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that he could have used these words. If the Deputy had committed himself to that statement he would be stating a fact.  England offered to pay the pensions and the British Government passed an Act putting the liability for paying the pensions on the British Treasury.  It was not merely an offer; it was a statutory obligation placed on the British Treasury to pay the pensions, and what the Provisional Government <Col N="755" /> did was to arrive at a decision some time later to recoup the British Government to the extent of 75 per cent. of the amount that is expended in respect of R.I.C. pensions.  I do not know what authority is claimed for this payment.  The only place that it is mentioned in any document, that is, any document signed by representatives of both countries, is in the Ultimate Financial Settlement, which the Minister for Finance has assured us has no legal significance whatsoever.  Not merely has the Minister for Finance assured us of that, but the Minister for Justice, who, of course, is a lawyer, which the Minister for Finance is not, has stated that the Ultimate Financial Settlement has no legal significance and no legal demand can be made in consequence of it.  Yet the only document in which reference is made to this amount is that so-called Ultimate Financial Settlement, which time proves to be nothing of the kind, as the Minister has since had to admit.  Other financial arrangements were made between the Free State Government and the British Government since, so that the so-called Ultimate Financial Settlement is not a financial settlement nor was it an ultimate financial settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, however, that nobody has yet produced any justification for the payment of this money.  Deputy MacEoin was reported at Ballymahon as having given a reason for paying it.  I am not going to discuss the reason, but what I do maintain, and what I ask the Dáil to realise, is that we need not pay.  We are not bound to pay.  Those who accepted the Treaty did not contract to pay.  The money is being paid over for some reason other than the reason that we are obliged to pay by the Treaty.  I know that when Deputy MacEoin, and some other Deputies opposite, decided to support the Treaty they did so in the determination that they were going to get every concession for the Irish people that they could get.  They told us they were going to see that that document was given an Irish interpretation. <Col N="756" /> Here is one section in which they can put their determination into operation.  Here is a section which quite clearly does not put upon the people any liability to recoup the British Government to the extent of 70 per cent. of the amount which is expended on the Royal Irish Constabulary.  There is no reference to it in the Treaty, or in Treaty No. 2, which was signed in 1925, and of which Deputy MacEoin does not speak.  There is a reference to it only in the Ultimate Financial Settlement, and that has no legal significance.</P>
    <P>If we decide to reject this payment we are not breaking any contract or repudiating any debt.  We are not embezzling any money.  We are not going to break any of the Ten Commandments about which the Minister for Agriculture talks so much at election times.  We are keeping our money at home.  It will be urged, as Deputy MacEoin has urged, that there is a reason for paying it.  He said that if England continued to pay the members of the R.I.C. England would have in the Free State a large force of intelligent, trained men which it could call on at any moment in the event of anything happening unexpectedly. If Deputy MacEoin's facts were right there would be an argument there, but as Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, his facts are all wrong. We are not paying the R.I.C., but we are recouping the British Government to the extent of 70 per cent. of the amount which the British Government pay to the R.I.C.  If England wanted to continue to pay these men in order that she would have this large force of intelligent, trained men here which she could call on at any time then there might be something to be said, but that argument disappears from the fact that she is paying them.  She is, in fact, paying the R.I.C. these pensions.  We are not.  We recoup her to the extent of £1,170,000 a year in order, as President Cosgrave said on one historic occasion, that we might cement the bonds of sympathy that bind us to the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> I suggest it is not good sense that the people of a poor country like this should be squandering their money in this fashion.  We could do quite a number of things with this £1,170,000.  We could give 15/- a week to every old age pensioner. That is much more than Fianna Fáil proposed to do under the Bill passed by the Dáil.  Yet we could do that without putting an additional halfpenny on the shoulders of the taxpayer merely by insisting on giving the Treaty an Irish interpretation and getting for our people the concessions which England was prepared to make at the time the document was signed.</P>
    <P>If we did not think it advisable to give what Deputy O'Higgins calls pocket money to the old age pensioners to the extent of 15s. a week, we could spend it in some other way. We could provide two-thirds of the amount required to de-rate agricultural land.  There is a case to be made for de-rating agricultural land. The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget statement in 1929, enumerated all the heavy additional taxes which would have to be imposed in order to get enough money to de-rate agricultural land. Here is two-thirds of the money already in our possession, which we can to-day ear-mark for that purpose if we so decide.  Instead of doing that, Deputies are actually going to vote it out to the richest treasury in the world, so that it may be enabled to pay generously the compensation which the British Government awarded to its former servants in Ireland.  Remember in this connection, that we did not even decide the amount of compensation that was going to be given to the R.I.C.  We were not consulted about that.  The British Government, acting on its own initiative and in the exercise of its own powers, decided the amount of compensation that was to be paid to each member of the R.I.C.  It passed an Act which entitled the R.I.C. to get these pensions out of the British Treasury.  That Act is on the Statute Book of the British Parliament.  If we pay the R.I.C., then they are being paid <Col N="758" /> twice.  But as Deputy MacEoin will understand, we are not paying the R.I.C.  We are re-paying the British Government £1,170,000, and by doing that we are throwing away the possibility of conferring on our people such big advantages as would accrue to them either from the giving of 15s. a week to old age pensions, or in the direction of de-rating agricultural land.  Even if we do not want to do either of these two things, we could with that money give permanent employment for fifty-two weeks in the year to over 12,000 men.</P>
    <P>I am merely giving these instances in order that Deputies may realise the seriousness of what they are being asked to do to-day.  It is a serious thing to spend almost 12½ per cent. of our total revenue in this way.  That sum of money is being expended in a manner that confers no benefit whatever on the Irish people.  A very large number of persons in receipt of these pensions do not even live in this country.  As far as we are concerned, the money is being wasted.  It need not be wasted.  We are not bound to pay. There is no contract and there is no debt, and we could hold that money here without dishonouring ourselves or dishonouring the country in any way whatever.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies of something that happened in this House yesterday.  A Bill was introduced to amend the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  The intention of the Government was that the Electricity Supply Board should be liable for income tax and for local rates.  The Government intended that the Board should be liable for these charges.  There is no doubt that on moral grounds the Board should be asked to pay these charges.  But the Electricity Supply Board was advised that the wording of the Act was faulty and that, in fact, they were not legally bound to pay unless the Act was amended, and so they did not pay.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce stood up yesterday and said that the Board was right not to pay until their liability had been clearly proved under the <Col N="759" /> existing Act, or until an amending Act was introduced.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was most cloquent in his defence of the attitude of the Electricity Supply Board, but he will not take a leaf out of their book and do the same thing in relation to the amounts which are now being expended under the Ultimate Financial Settlement.</P>
    <P>We do not ask Deputies to take our word for the various statements which have been advanced in relation to this matter.  We do ask them, however, to admit that there is a doubt.  If there is nothing else wrong, there is at least faulty drafting somewhere, and what we submit is that until that doubt has been removed the benefit of it should be given to the Irish people.  The benefit of this £1,170,000 would not be inconsiderable. If there is a doubt, then why should we pre-judge the question in favour of the British?  I want an answer to that question if there is an answer to it.  This is our money, and we need not pay it.  Any layman, much less a lawyer, reading the Treaty or the documents that followed the Treaty, can see for himself that it is not clear that we must pay.  In fact, a common sense interpretation of the Treaty is that we need not pay.  Competent lawyers have advised that we need not pay. There is a doubt.  Give the Irish people the benefit of that doubt.  Do so by refusing to pass this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I know that certain people resent questions of this kind being made Party questions.  We do not want them to be made Party questions. But national interests are involved, and it should be the concern of every elected representative of the Irish people to see that everything that they can honourably secure for the Irish people will be secured.  We maintain that this money can be honourably retained here.  We urge that it should be retained here, and we ask all Parties in the House to drop considerations of Party interest, to determine to come together on this issue and see that the benefit <Col N="760" /> of the doubt is given to the Irish people: that, if any claim for that money is capable of being sustained, that it will at least be advanced. That has not been done heretofore, and we ask the Dáil to take the first step in that direction to-day by voting against this Estimate.</P>

      <P>However, I would like to know what that big sum was to cover.  If it were not to cover police pensions, I would like to know what other items it was to cover. Again, we hear a great deal of talk to the effect that the police forces were never transferred to the Irish Government.  It seemed to be part and parcel of the negotiations all through that the police forces, the R.I.C., would not be transferred to the Irish Government: that the option to retire was to remain.  They were to go, but the compensation for their going was quite another <Col N="761" /> thing.  So far as I remember and so far as I could learn at the time from the negotiations it was to be an Irish liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any statement of the kind attributed to me with regard to this matter of the £20,000,000 at the time of the Treaty.  At the time of the Boundary Settlement, when I saw how the promises made to those who had accepted the Treaty had turned out, I warned the people of Ireland that they should look out for the financial settlement, which was still pending. That was a long time after the Treaty.  I said I had special reasons for warning the people, because there were documents which had passed between the British Government and ourselves, at the time of the Treaty, which indicated that the British Government were going to put up a bill against us for a very considerable sum of money.  When speaking, as I did at the moment from recollection, I said my recollection was that it ran up to something like 18 millions or 19 millions for the whole of Ireland.  I was justified in making that statement on the documents in existence.  That estimate of the British Government was based upon their estimate in connection with the 1920 Act.  I did not say that Ireland was liable.  I did not hold that Ireland was liable for any sum, but I did say that the Irish people had good reason to be on the look-out for any financial settlements that were then pending.  The British Government had, in these negotiations and papers, put up a claim to a sum of that particular kind.</P>
      <P>As regards how that sum was made up, I have not the documents here at the moment.  But it was made on the basis of certain imperial contributions made during the time just preceding the war.  I did not intend to intervene in this debate further than to say that I never at any time said that Ireland was liable, or that the Irish people were liable for that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of this matter I think it would be very difficult to put the case of the retention of that money more clearly than it has been put by Deputy Lemass. There is no obligation, even under the Treaty, to pay this sum of money which is paid over in pensions.  None whatever.  Why is it paid then? There is only the very same reason for doing it as for paying over the land annuities: that the present Executive think it good policy, I suppose, on their part in dealing with England, or thought at some time that it was good policy to give this money away.  They have never shown to anybody else why it is that they thought it good policy, or why they stand by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total burden of the sums paid out of this country at present to England represents 24 per cent. of the revenue raised here by the State for State purposes.  Side by side with the revenue raised by the State for State purposes the Irish people, one way or another, have to find twenty-four hundredths, or 24 per cent.  The sum that is paid by the German people for war reparations only represents 21 per cent. of the State revenue.  That is, side by side with the sum that is being raised for State purposes in Germany, the German people have to find something that corresponds to only 21 per cent. That burden in the case of Germany was the final sum they thought Germany could bear.  But here we are paying a sum which is heavier, relatively. than the sum Germany is expected to bear.  Why are we doing that, particularly when as regards items like the land annuities and the particular sum in this Estimate, not merely does common sense but the best legal opinion show we are not bound to pay.  I am very <Col N="763" /> glad, for one, to have an opportunity of voting against this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillianRKent" hpid="Mr. Kent Mr. Kent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to give a silent vote on this Estimate.  When we examine the past history of the R.I.C. pensioners what do we find? We find them bludgeoners of our people in every fair and market town in Ireland.  We find them going round with the crowbar brigade evicting our people from their homesteads and burning down their homes.  I fail to see how any Deputy in this House with any spirit of Irish nationality could vote for this Estimate, and that is the reason why I protest against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is quite simple.  As I pointed out before, the Article of the Treaty which has been referred to, Article X, really deals only with the protection of transferred officers.  If there is anything else in it it is an indication that the responsibility of the British Government in respect of pensions was limited to the liability which it undertook in respect of those who had been in the Auxiliary Police, and those who had been recruited into the R.I.C., in Great Britain, during the two years prior to the date of the Treaty.  The functions of the police were transferred; the personnel of the R.I.C. was not transferred because the Provisional Government and the British Government agreed on January 24th, 1922, that they should not be transferred.  The British, perhaps, had very good reason for not wanting them transferred, and we did not want them transferred either.  It may have been thought at the time that the Treaty was being drafted it would be possible to take over the R.I.C., except those recruited shortly before the Treaty, and to use them as a police force. At the time the Treaty had been passed and arrangements were being made for implementing the Treaty, it had become clear that the R.I.C. could not be used as the police force here, and that if they were to be transferred there would be nothing <Col N="764" /> possible for the Provisional Government except to disband them.  We arranged, on the 24th January, 1922, that instead of formally transferring the personnel there should be a disbandment of the R.I.C. There was no suggestion that because, instead of taking them over ourselves, and disbanding them, and getting the British Government to disband them, our liability, as set out in the Treaty, would be altered.  As a matter of fact, Deputy MacEntee referred to the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  The only thing that arises in connection with the Ultimate Financial Settlement was whether or not the 75 per cent. which had been paid up to the time should be confirmed or whether a slightly different percentage&mdash;one or two per cent. more or less&mdash;should be adopted and, consequently, whether instead of paying the pensions we should pay a compounded annual sum.  These things were set aside, and in the Ultimate Financial Settlement we confirmed the prior agreement, which had been acted on, that 95 per cent. of the pensions should be paid.  There was a vote of the Dáil in December, 1922, and that was the first time the matter about the R.I.C. pensions was before the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the non-transferred men, non-serving men&mdash;the men not serving at the date of the Treaty&mdash;their position was simply the position of the ordinary civil servant, of the postman to whom Deputy Esmonde referred, or an ex-official of the department of the R.I.C.  The cost of the ordinary R.I.C. for pensions was part of the ordinary cost of the pensions for police.  It was carrying out the principle set out, in the first instance, in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the heads of working arrangements which were settled in January, 1922, when it was arranged that all departmental funds, offices and property should be <Col N="765" /> transferred, and where it was agreed that, subject to any claims that might be made on a general financial adjustment, the liabilities at the time should be assumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These articles of agreement have not the force of law. Will the Minister admit that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when he was speaking, and if he would allow me to speak now I think it would be better.</P>
      <P>The position of these R.I.C. pensioners who were retired before the Treaty was signed is precisely the same position as that of civil servants, postmen and others.  Their cost is part of the cost of the functions of government.  In every country in the world the cost of police consists of three factors&mdash;the maintenance of stations and barracks and such things, the pay of serving members, and the pensions of retired members. The Treaty is not a detailed document. It only states three or four general principles, and one or two matters of detail.  The transfer of the powers of government, and everything connected with government, had to be arranged after the Treaty had been accepted, and what was the only possible arrangement was made, that where the functions of government were transferred, along with the functions went the departmental assets and the departmental liabilities relating to these functions.  If we were not to-day paying a penny in respect of R.I.C. pensions, the position would be that in fact we were getting from the British Government every year a contribution towards the cost of police because it would mean that, instead of having all the normal costs of police which every country has with regard to barrack maintenance, the pay of the serving personnel, and the pensions of the retired personnel, we would only have barrack maintenance and the pay of the serving personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not win such a victory over the British Government that we were in a position to force them <Col N="766" /> over a considerable period to give an annual contribution towards our cost of police or towards our Post Office, because there is not a bit more reason why a retired postman should be paid a pension by us than the retired R.I.C. constable.  I am talking about R.I.C. constables who had gone out of the service before the Treaty was signed.  The position is the same.  No one who would look at the facts of the case or who had any realisation of what the making of such international agreements meant&mdash;it was the separation of what was one territory into two territories&mdash;would for a moment suggest that the British should give an annual contribution to our Post Office by paying the pensions of the retired postal officials.  That would be absolutely ludicrous.  If we did not pay the pensions of the retired officials it would mean that the British were giving an annual contribution towards the cost of our Post Office. There is nothing in the Treaty to say that the British should give an annual contribution towards the running of the Post Office, towards the running of the Department of Agriculture or any of these things.  It was a necessary corollary towards the separation of the two States that these departmental liabilities or functional liabilities should be taken over by the Irish Free State along with the other functions.  The whole things is definitely clear and all the pedagogy and pedantry and all these things we hear from Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass do not alter it.  There is just one other point.  When the agreement of 1925, which relieved us of liability for the British public debt, was before this House the President stated to the House that the basis of that liability was that we should continue payments which we had been making in respect of these pensions and in respect of the land annuities.  I cannot quote the exact words from memory but his statement was something like this: &ldquo;I said to the British we have a heavy liability in respect of land annuities and pensions.  It is as much as we can bear.  I was fairly met and the liability for public debt <Col N="767" /> was wiped out.&rdquo;  That was at the absolute basis of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The point of view Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee put up is essentially absurd and essentially irresponsible.  You cannot get out of these ordinary liabilities, which are not only common sense liabilities but are the liabilities that would fall to be paid in any such case.  By some sort of slick trick you cannot say that when the British agreed themselves that they would disband the R.I.C. rather than hand them over to us to disband that they did not get some sort of formal I.O.U. or document of that sort.  We cannot carry on a sort of trickery in connection with the pensions.  That sort of smartness or bad faith not only had all the ordinary objection to it, but it has the material and base objection that there is no possibility of getting away with such things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When laying before the Dáil the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture for the year 1929-30, I explained in considerable detail the subjects covered by various groups of sub-heads.  The gross Vote for the Department of Agriculture is £624,691, and the net figure as shown in the Estimate&mdash; £475,456&mdash;is obtained by deducting from the gross figure the amount of Appropriations-in-Aid, £149,235.  Of this sum, £54,650 are not Appropriations-in-Aid in the real sense of the word, and this amount should be added to the figure which I have given, making the total net expenditure on the services covered by the Vote of the Department, £530,106. Sub-heads A, B, C and D form one group representing the salaries and expenses of the headquarters staff, which is not only administrative, but preventive.  The increased provision under sub-head A is mainly required for (1) annual increments for the existing staff; (2) employment of additional staff by reason of the extension of the Livestock Breeding Act to boars; (3) the employment of a superintending veterinary inspector and clerical staff for the working of the Fresh Meat Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads E 1, E 2, E 3, E 4, F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, F 5, F 6, F 7, K 2, L, M 1, M 2 and M 3 form one division under the heading of Educational <Col N="772" /> Services, the total cost of which will be £131,000 as against £125,000 last year.  Sub-heads H 1 and H 2, amounting to £83,600, consist of grants given to county committees of agriculture to augment the funds available from rates for the purposes of the educational, live-stock and other schemes administered locally by these bodies.  The sum contributed from rates will be about £48,600, which, together with the total of £83,600, will represent the gross amount available for the operation of these local schemes. That is to say, about £130,000 will be spent by the local authorities. Sub-heads G 1, G 2, G 3, I, K 1 and M 4, amounting in all to a little over £113,000 gross, or £72,000 net, as compared with £120,000 gross and £78,000 nett last year, represent central expenditure on work which, in many respects, is analogous to that done through the county committees of agriculture except that the administration of the services is carried out directly by the Department. I may here mention that we are no longer continuing loans to co-operative creamery societies, but it will be observed from the table of Appropriations-in-Aid that the Department expect to receive £10,500 in the current year in part repayment of advances issued in previous years.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head M 5, the sum provided&mdash;£90,000&mdash;is slightly less than that which was available last year, but it is difficult to make a precise estimate under this sub-head, as so much depends upon opportunities arising during the year for the acquisition of creameries still under proprietory control.  The total number of creameries purchased to date is 170, of which 75 have been closed as redundant, 41 have been transferred as operative premises to cooperative societies, and 54, which have had of necessity to be temporarily retained, are being worked in seven groups.  This exhausts the groups of sub-heads which I have classed as educational.</P>
    <P>The following variations in the provisions made for the current year as compared with last year call for some remark.  Sub-head E 2&mdash;<Col N="773" /> Veterinary Research.  The increase of £1,350 is due to arrangements for strengthening the technical staff at the Research Institute, a step which has been rendered necessary by the great increase of work in connection with animal diseases investigations. Sub-head E 3&mdash;World's Poultry Congress, London.  It is necessary in the interests of the country's poultry industry that the Irish Free State should be adequately represented at this important international Poultry Congress, especially in view of our extending export trade in eggs and poultry with Great Britain.  £1,900 represents the estimated gross cost of staging at the Congress Exhibition (1) a national exhibit illustrating the development of the Irish Free State poultry industry; (2) a trade exhibit of Irish Free State eggs and dead poultry; (3) an exhibit of Irish Free State live poultry, and cost of sending an official delegation.  Over £600 has been contributed by Irish Free State egg exporters towards the cost of the trade exhibit, and this sum, together with receipts in respect of the sale of exhibits, is estimated to reduce the net cost to £1,200.  Over fifty countries are taking part in the Congress.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads F 5 and F 6 I will take together.  With regard to university education, we are no longer concerned with capital expenditure in connection with the faculty of agriculture at University College, Dublin, as we completed our payments in that regard last year.  The full amount provided, £7,250, was spent. The work of extension of the Albert Agricultural College to contain the advanced laboratories cost £3,200. £1,500 was spent on the plant breeding and animal nutrition departments, £730 on the plant pathology and zoology laboratories; £800 on heating and so on.  The annual expenditure on the faculty came to £20,000 in 1929-30, but as certain appointments to the staff have yet to be made it is expected that an extra £2,500 will be required this year and provision has accordingly been made in the Estimates for £22,500.  The maximum annual <Col N="774" /> grant provided for by the University Education Act, 1926, is £24,984. As mentioned last year, it was necessary to increase the amount of the capital grant for the dairy science faculty at University College, Cork, from £67,000 to £85,000 in order to meet the increased cost of the dairy institute and creamery being erected in the College grounds.  The creamery building has been completed, the necessary machinery installed and the manufacture of butter is now proceeding.  It will, however, be some time before the dairy institute is finished.  By the end of last financial year, we had paid University College, Cork, close on £55,000 from the capital grant.  The acquisition of land and purchase of livestock and farm equipment accounted for nearly £10,000, the balance being spent on building operations.  The capital provision in this year's Estimate is £29,500.  The annual expenditure for 1929-30 came to £7,810.  Our estimate for that year was £10,000, but the fact that the creamery was not completed as early as we expected and that in consequence certain appointments to the staff were not made accounted for the saving.  This year, we have put down £11,000 as the amount of the annual grant and we expect the full amount will be required.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F 7 is new.  It is intended to provide a contribution towards the expenses of selected itinerant instructors in agriculture, for whom it is proposed in the coming summer to arrange a tour abroad which will provide them with an opportunity of studying at firsthand the farming methods followed in other countries.  Taking subheads H 1 and H 2 together, there is an increase of about £4,000.  The greater part of this is due to the necessity of providing the county committees of agriculture with funds to enable them to offer additional bull and boar premiums, the need for which is due to the operations of the Livestock Breeding Act. Sub-heads N 1, N 2, N 3, N 4, O 1, O 2, O 3, O 4, O 5, and O 6 may be grouped together under the general heading of &ldquo;Control.&rdquo;  The nature <Col N="775" /> of the work is, I think, sufficiently dealt with by the descriptive titles in Part 3 of the Estimates.  The cost of these control services is £53,761 gross, or about £33,000 net.  The Livestock Breeding Act, the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, and the Dairy Produce Act&mdash;that is, legislation which has been passed since the Free State came into existence for the better control of three important parts of our agricultural production&mdash;cost together £29,273 gross, or £9,693 net.  The variations in this group between last year's and this year's estimates represent, where increases occur, normal developments of the Department's activities.</P>
    <P>The following items may be referred to:&mdash;N 2, Bovine Tuberculosis Order.  The increase of £700 is due to more animals being slaughtered and to the higher proportion of &ldquo;not advanced cases&rdquo; now being reported.  In &ldquo;not advanced cases&rdquo; the compensation is three-fourths of the valuation as against one-fourth in advanced cases.  N 4&mdash;Livestock Breeding Act.  The increase of £110 is due to more appeals to referees and to provision for equipment, etc., for applying the Act to boars.  O 4 &mdash;Weeds. and Seeds.  There is an increase of £275.  Six additional inspectors will be employed as two additional local authorities, Offaly and Cork County Borough, have adopted the Act, and it has become necessary also to make a more intensive general inspection.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the Department's net Vote may, therefore, be summarised as follows:&mdash;Headquarters staff, £131,000; direct educational services, £131,000; co. committee schemes and supplementary schemes.  £155,500; purchase of creameries, £90,000; control services, £33,000; total, £540,500.  If Deputies take these items one by one, and consider them, I am sure it will be agreed that the money is well spent.</P>
    <P>There is £131,000 spent on the headquarters staff.  That, as I have said, includes the cost of practically all the important technical officers through the country with the exception <Col N="776" /> of the county committee of agriculture officers, and they are doing good work.  With regard to educational services&mdash;and everybody is in favour of education&mdash; they are costing £131,000.  The county committee schemes are administered by the local authorities, and therefore they must be highly efficient.  They are costing £155,500. With regard to the purchase of creameries, nobody has ventured to criticise the principle yet.  There may be difficulties of detail, but I think that all parties are enthusiastically in favour of buying and selling creameries.  But we cannot buy without paying for them, so we want £90,000 more.  Control services will cost £33,000.  We are getting better service from this than from any other item.  There are such things to be considered as the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Butter Act, the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, and the Dairy Produce Act. They are costing £9,000 net.  I do not think that the State is getting better value for any £9,000.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture is staffed as follows:&mdash;There are, roughly, 236 administrative officers, 272 technical officers, including agricultural overseers, assistant overseers, flax instructors, cow testing instructors and potato demonstrators; about 260 wage earners employed in connection with the various institutes at the ports, etc., making a total of 768.  In my opinion, you cannot get the farmers to go to school to learn; you have to go to them, and that is the reason we have so many technical officers.  In addition, there are 148 officers employed by committees of agriculture and also certain temporary men employed for short periods each year in connection with the operation of Acts, such as the Live Stock Breeding Act, the Weeds and Seeds Act, etc.  Of the 148 county committee officers, the salaries of 29 are provided wholly by the Department and the remainder are paid out of a joint fund composed of about £83,500 provided out of taxation, and about £48,500 out of rates.</P>
    <P>Special mention was made last <Col N="777" /> year with regard to the livestock schemes administered either through the county committees of agriculture or directly by the Department. I do not propose to repeat the analysis I then gave.  It may be sufficient to mention that we propose to expend out of the Vote nearly £38,500 in the current year as against a little over £35,000 last year, and that we hope to have nearly 1,600 ordinary premium bulls placed to the county committees of agriculture as against 1,545 in 1929.  In addition we will have 225 special premium bulls placed directly by the Department in congested districts, as well as about 200 animals of a similar standard located under special arrangements by which the animal is sold at a reduced price payable in three or four annual instalments. We have on the one side more than doubled the high class breeding animals of the country and we have cut out more than 50 per cent of the scrub animals.  That is bound inevitably to bring about a very considerable improvement in the quality of our livestock and, in fact, it has done so.</P>
    <P>As regards boars, including together animals for which premiums are provided directly out of the Department's funds, out of the county committees' funds and out of the fund to which the bacon curers contribute, we hope to have about 1,300 premium animals this year as compared with 1,100 last year.  Owing to our being unable to secure the full supply of rams for congested districts last year we are asking for an increased provision.  £1,950 instead of the usual £1,350.  We were short of rams last year.  We had the money, but we could not get them as they were not available.  We want to make up for it this year.  It is a particularly valuable scheme. We are continuing the provision made under sub-head G 2 (D) and under sub-head G 3 (D) for the purchase of high class animals for use as stock bulls.  Under the former sub-head £2,500 is intended to be spent on the purchase of dairy bulls and these animals are sold at reduced prices or are leased to members of the cow-testing associations. <Col N="778" /> Under the latter sub-head £2,000 is provided for the purchase of animals of the beef type.  Under G 3 (A) you will observe that we are continuing our policy of purchasing high-class stallions for re-sale at reduced prices. It is also to be borne in mind that under sub-head M 4 a considerable part of the sum provided is used to. make advances to persons who desire to purchase registered stallions or premium bulls and who would without assistance of this sort be unable to procure animals of a sufficiently high standard.  There are no other points in the various subheads which require comment at the moment&mdash;at least none that occur to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;That this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;  The Minister told us the net cost of the Department was £475,000 plus £54,000 which was given in appropriations; but it really came from taxation and therefore could not be described as earnings by the Department, so that the true net cost would be £530,000. There is in that amount, it is true, a certain amount of capital expenditure. There are a few large sums such as loans for agricultural purposes and the purchase of creameries.  Against that there are sums coming in, repayments of agricultural loans and loans to cooperative creameries, amounting to £42,000.  If we deduct what is going for capital expenditure, the ordinary routine work of the Department is costing about £450,000.  I believe a considerable amount of this money is spent with the object in view of having our live stock considerably improved.  I would like the Minister to keep in mind that where such a large amount is being spent it is a pity there should be other things, attention to which was drawn here during the year, allowed to remain unattended to, such as certain diseases that are affecting live stock.  No effective remedy has so far been applied or even suggested. Probably more than half of what is being spent on the Department goes towards the improvement of cattle.</P>

    <Col N="779" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of the whole amount a very big proportion would go towards the improvement of cattle.  We must take into account that a lot of this money is being lost. First of all, there is a decline in the total number of cows in the Free State within the last few years.  I admit it is a small decline, but still it is a decline.  There is a more serious position.  The State has contributed money for premiums for bulls, and a large amount in other ways for the improvement of live stock.  We find that a considerable number of the best heifers reared in the country are exported to England and other places.  It is perhaps due to the economic condition of the farmers that they must find ready money, and the best selling stock they have at present are the heifers, which can always meet with a ready sale.  At all times of the year they bring in the best prices of any cattle that the farmer may have.  The farmer is therefore tempted to sell the good heifers, and the majority of them are exported.  We lose thereby a very valuable number of cattle that would make good breeding stock if the farmers could afford to keep them.  If they cannot afford to keep them the Government should endeavour to do something to induce the farmers to keep the cattle for breeding stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain diseases that have been rather prevalent.  Tuberculosis has not been so prevalent within the last few years as previously. I have not any statistics to prove it, but some people hold that the pure-bred Shorthorn stock are more liable to tuberculosis than what we might call the common cattle.  That also applies to pure bred Poll Angus.  At any rate, tuberculosis has made big inroads on our live-stock during the last six or seven years since these Acts were passed by the Dáil to improve our live-stock.  I do not know that the Government have taken any effective measures to cope with this position, except that the Minister has mentioned that there is at least an inducement to people to report cases of tuberculosis, owing to the fact <Col N="780" /> that a certain compensation can be got.</P>
    <P>I read recently in a magazine of the measures adopted in Canada to get rid of tuberculosis.  I believe these methods, if adopted here, would be rather expensive, but I think they are going to be very effective in Canada.  They began in Canada by offering any owner of a herd who wished to get his cattle tested for tuberculosis a free test. The Government offered to send a veterinary surgeon, who would supply free tuberculin to test the cattle, and the stockowner in return has to undertake to get rid of any cattle that reacted to the test, and were considered incurable.  A number of stockowners adopted that system, and availed of the facilities offered by the Government.  The next stage was that if a big proportion of stock-owners in a certain area adopted that system it was then made compulsory on the minority, so that there could be a tubercular-free zone established which was altogether free from tuberculosis.  These zones can be increased gradually, and in that way they hope in time to eliminate tuberculosis completely from Canada.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Government, help was given by other authorities.  Certain municipalities, for instance, made bye-laws or regulations under which milk could not be supplied in these municipalities except from those who had adopted the Government's scheme for the testing of their herds.  In that way the owners of cows near big cities which adopted this system found it necessary to have tubercular-free cows in order to be allowed to supply milk to the cities.  That, again, made it necessary for the owners of these herds to buy their supply of cows and heifers from herds in other parts of the country which were free from tuberculosis.  The result was that there was an inducement to stock owners to adopt this system and get rid of tuberculosis from their herds. As I say, veterinary services and tuberculin were given free, and the only cost incurred was where an owner had a considerable number of cattle affected and had to bear a certain <Col N="781" /> loss in getting rid of them.</P>
    <P>That system would probably be very expensive if adopted here and I do not know that we can afford to adopt it, but it might be possible at least to take the first step the Canadian Government took and give free veterinary advice and free tuberculin to owners of herds who undertake to get rid of tubercular cattle and to keep their herds free from tuberculosis.  In that way we might possibly get some way on the road towards getting rid of tuberculosis. Then if the cities and towns felt that they could make bye-laws or regulations that all milk supplied in these cities and towns should be from tubercular-free cattle they would probably adopt such a scheme. I think, however, that the medical officers or the veterinary officers who would be advising the councils in these towns and cities would hardly advise them to take this step at present, because they would probably find that there would be a shortage of milk.  But if they felt that the Government were going to help them to stamp out tuberculosis they might be able to take the step after a few years, and it might have the very good effect which it has had in Canada of compelling milk suppliers to see that their cattle were free from tuberculosis, and the milk suppliers, in turn, would only buy cattle from other people down the country who have herds free from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There is another big difficulty here as compared with Canada, however, and that is, that the owners of herds in Canada keep a much larger number of cattle than on the average is kept by owners in this country, so that one stock owner in Canada who keeps his stock free from tuberculosis is a very important factor, whereas here it would probably have to be worked on a different system by taking areas.  However, I only put it forward as a suggestion to the Minister, if he has not given this question very full consideration&mdash;and I am sure he has&mdash;that he should at least look into it and see if something on similar lines could not be done here.</P>
    <P>Severe losses have also been caused <Col N="782" /> to farmers and stock owners in this country for three or four years past owing to the prevalence of abortion. From what I can learn from questions to the Minister and from other sources the Department has done very little to stamp out this disease. I do not know that they have really found out all that is necessary to be found out about how this disease is spread and so on, and how it can be cured.  Some people claim that it can be cured by vaccination, but there are owners whose stock have been afflicted with this disease who are equally as emphatic that vaccination is not any use.  I do not know if the Department is in a position to come to a definite decision as to whether this disease can be prevented by vaccination or not.  The ordinary farmer, who has not got very much scientific knowledge on the subject, holds that the disease has been spread owing to the fact that the number of bulls available has been largely reduced.  Some years ago when farmers were permitted to keep a scrub bull this disease was very little known because very seldom did the farmer who had more than nine or ten cows have to send his cows to a neighbour's farm. Every farmer who had nine or ten cows or more kept a bull of his own and, for that reason, there was no intercourse between the cows of one neighbour and another and the disease if it did occur in isolated places was not spread.</P>
    <P>According to the latest scientific knowledge, the disease is spread from cow to cow, and it was through having the cows of two neighbours mixing that the disease was spread. This disease may be the cause of some of the things that I have already mentioned.  It may be the cause, in the first place, of the number of milch cows in the country going down in the last few years, because there has been certainly a small percentage of the cows of the country which the farmers had to fatten off as they found it impossible to get those cows to come in calf again.  It may be responsible for the diminution in the number of milch cows.  Young heifers are also addicted to this disease.  It is also responsible, <Col N="783" /> perhaps, for the high price of young calves, because if young calves had been dear this year only and not dear last year and the year before, at this particular time of the year, it might be due to the low price of milk, but for the last three or four years the price of young calves at certain times has gone up as high as £4 or £5.  That is probably due to some scarcity, and the scarcity may be due to this contagious abortion.</P>
    <P>Another disease which our cattle are suffering from, and which has caused a considerable amount of loss and annoyance to owners of dairy cattle, is the disease of mamitis. That is a disease about which the Department has done little to enlighten the farmers of the country. Practically every drug in the pharmacy is used to cure this disease, nearly all of them with equally bad results.  It seems to be very much on the increase.  Some of the farmers in my county suffered through it in the last two years much more than previously.  They have been trying all sorts of patent remedies, and they do not yet seem to have got what would be regarded as a certain cure.  It is a disease that is followed sometimes by the loss of part of the udder, and sometimes by the loss of one or two of the teats, so that the cow is not as valuable as before it got the disease, and of course is not as good a milker as before.</P>

      <P>I suppose there are. One of the disadvantages of this disease is that when a farmer has gone to a considerable amount of trouble and expense to grade up his herd to the point where they will become registered cows they will not be registered because of this disease. I have known of a few cases recently where farmers had reached the point where their cows would be registered. They got this disease and the inspector refused to register them because they were not perfect in form and so on, although they would have perhaps yielded the requisite number of gallons of milk to have them registered. <Col N="784" /> I had a short argument with the Minister one day at Question time on this matter and he said the reason why they could not register them was that the trouble might be due to tuberculosis.  If it was certain that it was due to mamitis the same objection would not be raised, but they could not be certain that it was due to mamitis.  The Minister said that the veterinary surgeon could not possibly say that it was not due to tuberculosis and, therefore, he could not register the cow.  That is a great hardship on farmers who have gone to the trouble to grade up their cows, which is a process that takes years.  They find when they have just reached the point where their cows might be registered their whole labour is gone for nothing on account of this disease of mamitis.</P>
      <P>There is another thing also which is not perhaps any more prevalent in the last few years than it has been at other times.  That is the damage that is done to cattle by the warble fly.  It does not perhaps do very much harm to the live animal but it does great damage to the hides.  I have been informed by a person in the hide trade that buyers in England have complained to him that 75 per cent. of the hides sent across to them are damaged by the warble fly. He says that when the warble fly comes out through the hide it leaves a certain wound which like every other wound forms a cicatrix or scar and the hide is thereby damaged permanently and there is a certain cut in the price of the hide when it is being sold to the buyer on the other side.  I believe that in other countries remedies have been adopted to get rid of the warble fly completely and that the remedies are not by any means complex.  I believe it is analogous to the sheep dipping regulations and that because of these regulations in other countries the warble fly is practically eliminated.</P>
