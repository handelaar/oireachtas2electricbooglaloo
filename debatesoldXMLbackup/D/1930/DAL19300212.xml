      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what amount of Irish-grown tobacco leaf he has in bond; what steps does he propose to take to dispose of it, and will the growers be entitled to any portion of the price realised.</P>

      <P>The stock of Irish-grown tobacco-leaf in bond on 31st December, 1929, was 93,622 lbs.</P>
      <P>The tobacco in question is the property of private individuals, not of the Government, and I am, therefore, not in a position to take any steps to dispose of it.  The question of payment to the growers of any portion of the price realised is entirely a matter for the present owners of the tobacco, who may themselves be the growers.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question of making rear lights or reflectors compulsory on bicycles at night is receiving the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the Road Traffic Bill.  As regards the second part of the question, <Col N="3" /> there are no Gárda Síochána motor-cycle traffic patrols attached to any of the divisions adjoining the metropolitan area.  There are, however, three such patrols attached to the latter area, and they pay attention not only to roads within their own area but to the main trunk roads leading into the metropolis. During the year ended 31st December last these motor-cycle patrols in addition to the men on ordinary beat duty and patrol in the county and the city of Dublin were responsible for the following prosecutions in respect of breaches of the regulations dealing with the lighting of vehicles, viz:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, on the afternoon of January 23rd, detective officers raided and searched the homes of D. MacMahon, Birr Road, Nenagh, Secretary of the Nenagh Fianna Fáil Cumann, and Denis O'Neill, 35 Mitchell Street, Nenagh, Secretary of the Nenagh Fianna Fáil Comhairle Ceanntair, and if he is aware that the detective officers concerned demanded, read and copied correspondence and other documents relating to the Fianna Fáil organisation, and if he considers that the employment of the Gárda Síochána for such purposes is in the public interest.</P>

      <P>The residences of D. MacMahon and Denis O'Neill in the town of Nenagh were entered and searched by members of the Gárda Síochána on the 23rd ultimo in pursuance of a search order for firearms issued under the Firearms Act, information having reached the police which led them to believe that these men were in possession of revolvers.  During the course of the search the police came across a certain amount of seditious propaganda issued by a so-called. Republican Prisoners' Committee, 27 Dawson Street, Dublin, together with a certain amount of pamphlets of an extremist variety purporting to have been issued by an organisation calling itself Ghosts.  I am of opinion that the search order in these cases was in the public interest.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state to what extent the Commissioners' rules and regulations with regard to national schools are still in force; how long those rules have been out of print; whether the changes, emendations and additions to the rules made during the past seven years have been printed; and, if so, whether they are available in collected form for teachers and managers, and when will the rules which now obtain be codified and printed, and whether the Minister will, in the meantime, make due allowance for teachers accused of violating the rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last complete issue of the rules and regulations for national schools was printed and published in 1919.  That edition has been out of print for the last few years.  The changes, emendations and additions to the rules made during <Col N="6" /> the past seven years have been printed in pamphlet form from time to time, and copies were sent as a matter of course to all managers and teachers of national schools.  The work of re-arranging and re-codifying the rules has been proceeding in my Department for some time, and the new edition, which is in course of preparation, will be published at an early date.  In regard to the concluding portion of the question I have no reason for believing that any teacher employed in a national school need be unaware of the existing regulations, seeing that a copy of the rules in force in 1919 was issued to each school and that all changes made since have also been notified to the teachers.</P>

      <P>It is now the practice to publish in pamphlet form the marks obtained at such examinations, including the examination referred to in the question.  The pamphlet can be obtained through Messrs.  Eason and Son, Ltd., O'Connell Street, Dublin. In the circumstances it is not considered that the Department would be justified in issuing the marks individually to the teachers who sat at the examination.  I am, however, considering whether it would not be more convenient to discontinue the publication of the pamphlet and to notify each teacher of the marks he has obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is in constant touch with the position in the Flour Milling Industry.  I am informed that results in the year 1929 compared favourably on the whole with those of preceding years. This information is confirmed generally by the fact that in 1929 flour imports were less by some 62,000 cwts. than in 1928 while imports of wheat were greater by some 965,000 cwts.  Since Christmas there has occurred a sharp and abnormal fall in the price of wheat which caused buyers of flour generally to hold off orders.  The result has been that most of the Irish mills were put on short time but I am informed that the mills in Great Britain and flour importers were affected in exactly the same way.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence of the dumping of flour to the extent alleged in the question and no confirmation of the suggestion that any substantial quantity of flour has been imported during recent months at prices with which the efficient mills in the Saorstát were not prepared to compete. At the present quoted prices for Cross-Channel and Irish flour a price for bread of 10d. per 4lb. loaf delivered is justified according to the Report of the Tribunal on Prices.</P>

      <P>According to Article 6 of the Covenant of the League of Nations the secretaries and staff of the Secretariat of the League are appointed by the Secretary-General with the approval of the Council. No restriction (except approval by the Council) is placed on the Secretary-General's power in the matter of appointments and no definite rule in the matter of the proportion of nationalities to be employed has been laid down by the Assembly. In accordance, however, with the desire of the Assembly, the Secretary-General has stated that he would endeavour to ensure an equitable distribution of nationalities within the Secretariat, having regard always to the competence of officials for particular posts.</P>
      <P>According to the latest returns there are at present thirteen Irish officials on the staff of the Secretariat.</P>
      <P>With regard to the International Labour Office, the Director of that Organisation is, under Article 395 of the Treaty of Versailles, responsible for all appointments to the staff and is bound to select persons of different nationalities, so far as this is possible with due regard to the efficiency of the work of the Office. At the present time, there are five Irish Officials on the staff, including one Chief of Division.  Two members of the female staff who were recruited as Irishwomen have acquired other nationalities by marriage.</P>

      <P>A report has been received from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations regarding the meeting of Agricultural Experts which was summoned by the Economic Committee of the League to meet last month in Geneva.  The personnel of this meeting was determined by the Economic Committee in consultation with the International Institute of Agriculture.  It was composed, not of representatives of Governments, but of experts appointed on personal grounds as being familiar with the general problems of agricultural economy, and already in close contact with the work of the League and with the International Institute. It was not practicable, in the circumstances, for the Irish Government to take any part in the proceedings of the meeting.</P>
      <P>No Irish expert was invited to attend the meeting, nor is there at present any Irish member on the Economic Committee, which selected the experts, and which is itself a Committee of Experts and not of representatives of Governments.</P>
      <P>I may add, however, that the question whether it would be possible to secure on the committees concerned the appointment of experts familiar with the economic problems of this country, if such a course were desirable, is at present under consideration.</P>

    <P>These lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, would become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  The owners objected to the acquisition of the lands of Galleastown and Ballynamona on the grounds that they were farmed in conjunction with the lands of Crossdrum, which has been in occupation of the Rotherham family for upwards of a century and that the latter lands could not be profitably worked without them.  This objection was heard in the Court of the Irish Land Commission and disallowed. The owner appealed to the Judicial Commissioner, who reversed the decision of the Land Commission by excluding the lands of Galleastown and Ballynamona from the proceedings.  An offer was communicated to the owner for the lands of Knocklough and Newtown, but has been refused by him.  It is now under consideration as to whether the price should be fixed and published in accordance with the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands and Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science) Bill, 1929, be read a second time.  This is a short Bill, and it is practically all contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 2, which reads:</P>
      <P>(2) So much of sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Principal Act as limits the amount to be paid thereunder to University College, Cork, to a sum not exceeding £67,000 (sixty-seven thousand pounds) shall cease to have effect and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the amount to be paid under the said sub-section to the said college shall not exceed the sum of £82,000 (eighty-two thousand pounds).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an amendment of the University Education (Agricultural and Dairy Science) Act, 1926.  Under <Col N="26" /> that Act it was agreed that a sum of £67,000 be given to the University College, Cork, for the purpose of establishing buildings and plant and their equipment, and the formation of a creamery necessary for an agricultural faculty.  It was the intention of the College to build a creamery outside the College.  They had made arrangements to do that, but the residents in the neighbourhood where the creamery was to be built objected to the creamery, and the College authorities were advised that if legal proceedings were taken it would be possible to prevent the building of the creamery there.  It was then decided to build the creamery within the College.  The College authorities decided, and the Minister for Finance agreed, that the new building should conform in type with the College buildings. Further, it was agreed that the cost of the new lecture hall should be given to the College.  That accounts for the difference between the £67,000 and the £82,000, which the Bill authorises the Minister to pay. I am sure that will be agreed to by the House unanimously.  There is also a further provision which allows the Minister to make payment up to 1932.  The original intention of the Cork University was that the buildings should be completed by October, 1929.  Now, they find they cannot carry out that intention, and it is provided that they be allowed up to 1932 to complete the building.  As this is an urgent matter and the College is in need of money, I would ask the House to agree to the Final Stages being taken to-morrow.</P>

    <P>There has been a considerable difficulty in getting agreement on this archæological definition.  There was a long discussion in the Seanad on it.  Eventually we arrived at an agreement by this particular amendment of the definition.  It somewhat limits the definition as originally introduced.

      <P>New Section.  Before section 25 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;25.&mdash;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to injure, deface or destroy any archaeological object, nor shall it be lawful for any person to alter any archæological object otherwise than under and in accordance with a licence in that behalf granted under this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister for Education may if he thinks fit issue to any person a licence to alter a specified archæological object in such manner, to such extent and subject to such conditions as are specified in such licence.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every person who injures, defaces, destroys or alters an archæological object in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment means adding a new section and it brings the archæological objects into line with the national monuments, as regards putting restrictions on any interference with them and preventing their destruction.  I think it is quite a usual thing to have very valuable objects of antiquarian interest discovered and afterwards to find these destroyed or melted down.  At present, there is no penalty imposed for their destruction.  This amendment will impose a penalty.  At the same time, it gives power to the Minister for Education, if he thinks fit, to issue a licence to alter a specified archaeological object.</P>

      <P>Section 11.  The word &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; deleted wherever it occurs and the word &ldquo;hares&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to Section 11, which enables game birds to be caught for the purpose of restocking <Col N="31" /> lands.  It was pointed out in the Seanad that it is not really practicable to net grouse; that the number of grouse that escape alive when you attempt to net them are very few, that a great number of them are killed, and that the word ought not to be inserted in the section.  On hearing expert views expressed in the Seanad, it appeared to me that it would be wise to delete the word &ldquo;grouse.&rdquo;  The Seanad also suggested and carried an amendment to the effect that it should be possible legally to trap hares for the purpose of re-stocking.  That appears to me to be quite reasonable, and I ask the House to agree to both.  Amendment No. 2, which follows, is consequential on No. 1.

      <Col N="32" /> Section 28, sub-section (1). After the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 51 the following words inserted: &mdash;&ldquo;save with the permission in writing of the Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána for the District.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 28 is the section which prohibits the burning of gorse, furze, whin, heath, fern or greg-ling during certain periods.  The prohibited periods is between the 1st April and the 14th July.  The Seanad thought there might be stretches of country in which there are no birds of any kind in respect of which it would be unnecessary to have a provision of this nature.  In consequence, power is given to the local Superintendent to issue a permit if he is satisfied that there is no reason why a burning should not take place during those months.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if the Superintendent of the Civic Guard is supposed to be the sole judge of whether or not the district is inhabited by birds.  Will the Superintendent be directed in accordance with any policy on the part of the Ministry, is he to seek advice from some consultative council, or act entirely on his own judgment?</P>

      <P>Some person with local knowledge will have to be selected for the purpose of deciding whether or not the land is frequented by game.  There does not seem to be any other person in a position to exercise authority of that nature except the Superintendent. Of course he will naturally receive from my Department, through his own headquarters, instruction as to the principles on which he is to act.  Permission will not be given if there are game birds on the lands in question, and it may be given if there are not.  This is really put in in relief of the farmer and in order that there may be somebody who can give, as it were, an exemption order.  The Superintendent is the person on the spot and he will have some knowledge.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to see the amendment put in.  I welcome the amendment, because when the Bill was going through the Dáil I pointed out the serious hardship that might be inflicted on certain people if they were not permitted to burn furze at certain times.  At the same time, I do not like to see the Superintendent of the Civic Guards selected as the sole judge of what is right or wrong.  Even if he is a just man he may not be very long in the district, and he may not know very much about the local conditions.  I would like to know whether the Department itself is going to take a hand in this matter and advise the Superintendent what to do.  Would it be possible, if the owner of land felt he had a grievance, for an appeal to be lodged with the Ministry over the Superintendent's head?</P>

      <P>The owner could do so if the Superintendent refused.  Just as under the Firearms Act, he could make an appeal to the Ministry and the Superintendent would be asked for an explanation.  Just as under the Firearms Act the power is with the Superintendent to decide.  You must have persons with local knowledge. Let us say that there is a certain area of mountain in the Deputy's constituency.  As to whether or not there are grouse on it, I could not know personally, and I would have to get the views of some person in the locality.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 31 a new section inserted as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may establish by order a Consultative Council for the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter in relation to the making of regulations under, or otherwise carrying into execution, the provisions of this Act, or any other matter affecting the preservation and propagation of game or any other matter affecting the game industry.</P>
      <P>(2)  The said Consultative Council, if and when appointed, shall consist of such persons (being persons having experience or special knowledge in relation to the matters on which the Council may give advice or assistance to the Minister) as the Minister shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof, and shall include representatives of both Houses of the Oireachtas and of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
      <P>(3)  Each member of the said Consultative Council shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain his membership for two years only from the date of his nomination, but shall be eligible for renomination.</P>
      <P>(4)  The said Consultative Council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister and also on such occasions as the Council may from time to time determine.</P>

      <Col N="35" /> (5)  Payments may be made by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to the members of the said Consultative Council and Committees thereof to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a new section which was inserted in the Seanad.  It enables&mdash;it does not force&mdash;the Minister for Justice, if he thinks it advisable in administering this Act, to call in a council of experts to advise him. Personally, I cannot see that the existence of that power could do any harm.  If it turns out in the working of the Act that a council of this nature could be helpful and that it was advisable to appoint such a council, I think it is well that there should be power to call in these experts.</P>

      <P>Go naontuíonn an Dáil leis seo, le hOrdú Pinsean Constablaíocht Ríoga na hEireann (Fir d'Eirigh as agus Fir do Briseadh), 1929 a dineadh ar an 3adh lá de Mhí na Nodlag, 1929, fé Alt 3 den Acht Aois-liúntas agus Pinsean, 1929 (Uimh. 11 de 1929), agus a leagadh fé bhráid na Dála ar an 3adh lá de Mhí na Nodlag, 1929.</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1929, made on the 3rd day of December, 1929, under Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1929 (No. 11 of 1929), and laid before the Dáil on the 3rd day of December, 1929.</P>
      <P>The Order proposed to be approved by the Dáil has been circulated to Deputies for some considerable time.  The major portion of the Order deals with the payment of pensions to widows of resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men and it follows generally the lines that are applicable to widows of deceased pensioners of the D.M.P. or the Civic Guards.  It is in accordance with the sections of the 1929 Act.  Part 2 of the Order, which is on page 5, makes one or two amendments in the Order of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first paragraph of Part II. provides, in a case where there has been a certificate that the person to whom a pension has been granted is unable by reason of mental disability to manage his affairs, for the payment of pension, either wholly or in part, to the institution or person having care of such person.  As a matter of fact that has been the practice under the original Order of 1924, but a certain doubt has been raised whether there was sufficient authority for doing it, and it is for that reason that the paragraph has been inserted with a retrospective effect.  Paragraph 21 is inserted to correct a slip in the Order of 1924, which provides <Col N="37" /> that a pension might be forfeited in case a person was sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months.  Apparently, as the Order is worded, a person who gets imprisonment for a period of more than three months could not have his pension interfered with. The word &ldquo;not&rdquo; has accordingly been taken out.  The other paragraph applies to a class of persons who are covered by the provisions of the original Order, namely, the class of resigned and dismissed R.I.C. men who were dealt with by Section 2 of the Act of 1929.</P>

      <P>That leave be given by the Dáil to introduce the following Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the service of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, namely:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>The principal sum is one of £14,800 for old age pensions, which arises from the fact that for the last couple of years there has been an upward trend in the number of persons receiving old age pensions.  The extra sum required for property losses is £100,000.  This is due to the fact that greater progress has been made with reinstatement than was anticipated when the original estimate was made. Part of that progress arises, I think, from pressure put on people who are entitled to compensation by the Department of Finance.  There is a sum of £5,900 for public works and buildings, which is partly to make provision for the rebuilding of the Shrine of St. Moibhi, which would have been covered by the waters of Lough Derg in consequence of the Shannon scheme if it had been left in its original site.  The other item of £5,055 is for the cost of equipping and furnishing the Delegation offices in Rome and Berlin.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation, Compassionate and Additional Allowances and Gratuities, etc., under sundry Statutes; Compensation under Article 10 of the Treaty of 6th December, 1921; Compassionate Allowances, Gratuities and Supplementary Pensions awarded by <Col N="40" /> the Minister for Finance; the salary of the Medical Referee; and sundry repayments in respect of Pensions at present paid by the British Government, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the only item on this Estimate requiring any explanation is in JJ, an extra statutory pension of £124 16s.  This extra statutory pension would be payable to an ex-member of the R.I.C. named Denis Sheehan, who was serving in Belfast, and who gave very considerable assistance to those who were in charge of Oglaigh na hEireann there. He was entirely in sympathy with the national movement, and he would have resigned from the R.I.C. but for the fact that he was persuaded to remain.  He remained on until disbandment took place, and he was duly disbanded.  He was awarded a pension by the British Government, but afterwards information came into their hands which showed that he had actually been co-operating with the Volunteers in such a way as would have procured his dismissal if the information had come into their hands earlier.  They stopped his pension.  The position, therefore, was that he had no pension, although if he had resigned he would undoubtedly have been entitled to one.</P>
    <P>The pension to which he would have been entitled had he resigned and been pensioned by the Saorstát. Government under the provisions which enabled pensions to be paid to resigned and dismissed members of the R.I.C. amounted to £124 16s.  The Saorstát proportion of his British pension which would have been recouped from the British would have been £111 3s., so that there is an additional charge on the Saorstát Exchequer of £13 per annum.  The case has been very carefully investigated and the Government have no doubt as to the facts.</P>

    <P>This Vote arises from the fact that the rates struck by the local authorities have been higher than was anticipated when the estimate was struck.  The estimate was based on the rates levied during the year 1928-29 in various counties in which there is Government property in respect of which this allowance in lieu of rates must be paid.  Amongst these counties are Kildare, Dublin, Cork, Donegal, Clare, Galway and in these counties the rates have been increased by 4d., 1/1, 1/3, 1/- and 2/2. The result of this has been that a further sum of £1,100 will be required in addition to the £87,900 already voted.</P>

    <P>The necessity for this Supplementary Estimate of £300 arose from the fact that certain County Registrars when supplying figures on which the original Estimate was based, omitted to include costs which had been awarded under Section 42, sub-section (3) (c) of the Act, with the result that the original Estimate was short the amount required by £249 9s. 6d.

As I say, I have no direct responsibility for it, but the proposal of the Department of Justice, which was agreed to, is merely to suspend for one year, or to let one year slip during which there would be no applications for abolition, and afterwards to resume the procedure which the Act provided for, of reducing the number of licences gradually.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for a grant in aid of the Expenses of the Royal Irish Automobile Club in connection with the International Motor Races held in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, on the 12th and 13th July, 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that the races which were held last year resulted in a net deficit of £3,256. After the races, when this fact became known, the Committee which had charge of the event and which hoped to make it an annual event in the Phoenix Park, approached the Government and represented that the loss which had occurred this year would, if it resulted in a call being made on the guarantors, make it impossible to hold races again; that if they made a call for even 25 per cent. of the guarantee on the individuals promoting the motor races this year it would be unlikely that they would guarantee the amounts next year and the whole idea of annual motor races would fall through.  They represented that they had expenses this year which they were not likely to have in the same measure in subsequent years, that some of them would be unnecessary, and that some of them, while they might not be entirely unnecessary, could be reduced and modified in various ways.  They further represented that they had every prospect, in case they were able to hold <Col N="44" /> the races again, of making them financially successful, and that if that happened there would be no difficulty in holding them year after year.  The Government believed that the holding of these races would be of sufficient advantage from the point of view of bringing visitors to the country, and from the point of view of the tourist development, to justify the payment of this sum which is proposed, so as to give the Committee which had charge of the event an opportunity of repeating it and of having it repeated year by year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the granting of this sum for several reasons.  The first is that I understand that before these races were started, and before the Committee got to work, they asked for personal guarantees from several citizens of the State.  They got these personal guarantees, and when the races were over they found that they had a small deficit.  Now, if these guarantees were worth anything at all, this deficit should be made up by the people who gave the guarantees and the promoters of the races should not be coming to the Government and the taxpayers afterwards to make good the guarantee that these people had been patriotic enough to offer to enable the races to be held. On the question as to whether it is good policy from the national point of view to give a guarantee for motor races, I am also opposed to this grant.  The money subscribed, whoever subscribed it or wherever it is collected for this purpose, goes to a number of foreign drivers.  No Irishmen take part in these races, and the object of the races is to advertise foreign manufactured cars. If people want to advertise cars, let the makers of the cars put up the prizes to be competed for by these foreign drivers.  I fail to see why the citizens of the country or the taxpayers should be asked to indemnify these enthusiastic motorists who have already given a guarantee. Afterwards, when there was a call upon them to subscribe a small sum, they turned to the Government to <Col N="45" /> relieve them of the guarantee they had already given.  There will be some trouble about guarantees for next year, but I see that a sum of over £16,000 has already been guaranteed.  On the same principle, this time next year we will be called upon to give another sum.  A precedent is made this year and next year these guarantors will slip out of their guarantees and say: &ldquo;The Government came to the rescue last year; there is no reason why they will not do it this year.&rdquo;  So this guarantee is perfect humbug.  I have already stated the effect of these races is merely to encourage road hogs.  We have enough wild men driving on the roads at present without foreigners coming here to educate them on how to take corners on one wheel.  I do not think that there is any real benefit in the races being held here.  It would be better if they were not held here at all.  On this matter, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance or whoever is responsible for the Board of Works, whether there is any sum being paid to the Board of Works in connection with the letting of the Phoenix Park for these races.  I oppose the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the same opinion as Deputy O'Hanlon. I have spoken to several guarantors, and one who was guarantor for a very large amount said that if the House voted this money it would be a gross misuse of public funds. When the people have the public spirit to give guarantees, I do not think that spirit should evaporate when a small part of them has to be paid.  A lot of the people have spoken about the action of the Government in giving the exclusive use of the Park to the Automobile Club for these races.  Nobody was allowed in unless he paid a heavy entrance fee.  As Deputy O'Hanlon says, the same performance will go on next year.  They have already got £16,000 and they still are pestering people to give guarantees for the races, although they said they only wanted £15,000.  Next year we will be asked to vote the same amount, and I am absolutely opposed to the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the views of Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Murphy, because my colleagues and I personally are very strongly opposed to the granting of this money.  We do not see any reason or excuse for it.  Very good reasons have been offered by the two Deputies who have already spoken, and I am glad to add my voice to the protest of Deputy Murphy with regard to the closing of the Phoenix Park.  We are blessed in the City of Dublin in having such a place as the Park as an heirloom, especially for the poor of the City of Dublin, and it is, I would say, an impudent thing on the part of those responsible for the organising of the race to ask that the Park be closed.  It is certainly, to my thinking, unpardonable on the part of the Government to close up the Phoenix Park for two whole days so that a few&mdash;a very few, because there were very few entries last year &mdash;might be allowed to show their skill, as Deputy O'Hanlon said, as road hogs.  The races are of no advantage whatsoever, from the point of view of bringing visitors to Dublin. I am told on very reliable authority that the number of visitors who could be said to have been brought into Dublin in connection with the races last year would not be 200.  I am told that figure has been got from authoritative sources here in the City of Dublin.  From that point of view, the reason offered by the Minister for Finance falls completely to the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing that appeals to me mostly is the question of the closing up of the Phoenix Park to the poor of Dublin particularly but also to all classes of citizens, those who are confined during the whole of the week and have only Saturday afternoon and Sunday to use the Park. It is improper that the Park to which time at any rate has secured for them the right of entry to get the pure air that is necessary for them, should be closed up.  It is unpardonable that the Government should agree to closing up the Park and more unpardonable still that they should give in addition the sum of <Col N="47" /> £3,000 out of the ratepayers' money. There was one thing last year which struck me as a thing that money might, if possible&mdash;if there was any money to spare anywhere&mdash;be found for and, that was the provision of a boat to enable the population of a certain island off the West Coast to come to the mainland.  While we had £3,000 here to spend on road racing money for these people on the West Coast could not be found to enable people to go back and forward and bring their food themselves and the mails from the mainland. It was an extraordinary thing that in that case a sum of £700 or £800 could not be found in the National Exchequer.  Here, we find £3,000 for a thing of no benefit whatever to the country.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon was the advertising of those motor cars.  Well, if they want to do any advertising, there are other means open to them, and I do not think we should lend ourselves and the citizens' money for that purpose.  The motor trade is not of such great advantage to us here.  Practically every development in the motor trade so far has meant further exportation of Irish money, the further taking of money out of production here.  Everything connected with motor cars has to be procured from outside, and there is no help for Irish industry so far as the promotion of motor races is concerned.  It is all money going out of the country for a useless and unproductive purpose.  I cannot see what advantage to Irish industry or to the City of Dublin in any respect is to be gained by the expenditure of this £3,000.  Some may argue that a few people in the City get employment, but I do not think the advantage to whatever few get employment for a day or two would outweigh the grave national disadvantages there are in the promotion and encouragement of races of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy said that certain gentlemen who are interested have put up guarantees.  Some of the papers tell us that they have been asked and have put up guarantees. <Col N="48" /> It is the suggestion of&mdash;I think it is called&mdash;the Royal Automobile Club. Now that royal institution is wealthy enough and has wealthy members enough on its roll to be able to pay for their own amusements. Dublin ought not to be asked to do it.  That royal institution is one, so far as I am aware, that does not need and does not want, and perhaps does not expect any sympathy from us, but certainly they ought not to be given sympathy to the tune of £3,000 for the promotion of luxury races that very few of not alone Dublin citizens, but of those outside Dublin, would derive any advantage from.  It passes my imagination how the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, who is supposed to be such a tight wad, if some organs of the Press are to be believed, were induced to provide or to suggest that the House should provide £3,000 for such a useless, wasteful and extravagant purpose.  I see no excuse on earth for it and I hope this House will reject by a great majority the suggestion to throw away £3,000 of our money for such a purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a considerable amount of misapprehension about these motor races and the sum of money proposed to be voted for them.  Deputy O'Hanlon talked a considerable amount about bringing over a small number of persons to race in the Phoenix Park and that this sum of money was given in prizes to them. I think the Deputy is wrong.  As far as I know, the prizes were all put up separately by different persons, and some of them by newspapers.  This money was spent in the preparing of the course and the erection of the stands and other things of that nature necessary for the carrying out of the races.  It appears to me to be rather a poor argument to say that very few persons took part in the races and that, therefore, the races ought not to be allowed.  If you consider the thousands of persons who go down to Punchestown, the number of persons who ride horses in Punchestown are very few. It was said also that a comparatively <Col N="49" /> small number of persons frequented the races in the Phoenix Park.  That is inaccurate.  An enormous crowd frequented the Phoenix Park during the two days on which the races were held.  When Deputy O'Kelly says that only 400 people came into Dublin, I am afraid he is entirely misinformed. I happen to know that people from all over Ireland came up to that race meeting and, in addition, large numbers came from the other side of the Channel.</P>
      <P>It is not for the encouragement of the building of motor cars or the encouragement of the motor industry that these races are held.  It is for the bringing over of people to this country and making this country an attractive place for people to come to.  That is the object for which these motor races are held. That is the sole object, and it appeared to me last year, at any rate, that it was very successful.  It was promoted by the Irish Automobile Club.  A good deal of Deputy O'Kelly's speech was directed to the fact that it was what he called the &ldquo;Royal Automobile Club,&rdquo; but its royalty exists in the Deputy's imagination. It is only in his imagination that the royalty is there.  It does not call itself the Royal Irish Automobile Club.  It calls itself the Irish Automobile Club.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Automobile Club is how I always heard it described.  The object of the persons who promoted that was not to develop the motor industry, but to make Dublin an attractive place for persons to come to and to bring people over to Ireland.  It is said that the guarantors were willing to put up the money.  I have no doubt the guarantors were.  I do not suppose any single guarantor would have kicked, but if the guarantors had to pay the amounts which would be demanded of them this year I do not see any possibility of the guarantors coming forward next year.  In other words, the races would have to be dropped.  Deputy O'Kelly thinks these races are not good.  He goes <Col N="50" /> further and says that they are actually harmful.  I take a completely opposite view.  I think that anything that encourages the tourist traffic of this country is very valuable.  I think we ought not to neglect our tourist traffic.  I think we ought to do everything that lies in our power to develop it.  I believe that when we invest money in encouraging tourists to come to this country we are investing it very wisely, and one of the most attractive things is motor racing of this kind.  Undoubtedly, it is enormously attractive, and it brings over a great number of people and, therefore, in my opinion, it is money very well invested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of points in the speech of the Minister which I would very much like to have elaborated.  He stated, in the first place, that this money was not spent in giving the prizes to the successful competitors but in the improvement of the course and the erection of grand stands.  It is quite obvious that the Minister has not read the Estimate.  That is obvious, in the first instance, from his reference to the Royal Irish Automobile Association, which is the title of the body as used in the Estimate.  It is obvious, in the second place, because he will note that there is a footnote to the Estimate which states that the State has already expended the sum of £5,500 on the improvement of roads in the Phoenix Park in connection with this function.  The State, I would therefore inform the Minister, has already expended out of the money provided by the taxpayer this sum for the improvement of the course and the necessary alterations of the roads.  Apparently, therefore, from the Minister's speech, the entire amount realised by the races plus the amount it is now proposed to make available to the Automobile Association, was devoted to the erection of a grand stand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And to make the necessary alterations in the course. I am going to put to the House the view that not merely is it inadvisable that we should facilitate the holding of these races but that the national interests require that we should prevent their taking place. Whatever the Minister may believe to the contrary, the main purpose for which the Royal Irish Automobile Association organised this function was to encourage the importation of motor cars and motor spirit.  The members of the Royal Irish Automobile Association who exercise the most influence in the councils of that body are those who are engaged as agents in the importation of motor cars and spirit.  These races not merely in the Irish Free State, but in other countries, are organised for that one purpose, and that one purpose alone.</P>
      <P>I might draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the races held last year were quite successful in the realisation of that purpose.  If he examines the general summary relating to external trade recently published by the Department of Industry and Commerce he will see that in the year 1929 we imported 9,634 motor cars and motor cycles, an increase of 42 per cent. on 1928. The amount which we paid last year for the motor cars and petrol which we imported was £2,500,000.  Imports must be paid for by exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to Punchestown races.  He compared Punchestown races with the motor races in the Phoenix Park.  But horse races do serve the interests of an important industry in this country. Our exports of horses last year were valued at £2,500,000.  In effect, therefore, we gave away our entire export of horses for nothing except <Col N="52" /> in so far as we got these motor cars and petrol in exchange for the £2,500,000.  Do we think that that expenditure was wise?  If the Minister had examined the trade returns he would have noticed that our adverse trade balance last year increased by a quarter of a million pounds.  That increase in the adverse trade balance was more than occasioned by the increase in the value of the motor cars which were imported.  Does the Minister think, therefore, that it is advisable that we should spend public money for the purpose of encouraging the importation of these cars in greater numbers?  The giving of this money by this House will be in effect a subsidy on a form of imports which is not urgently required in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have gone into greater detail concerning the expenditure of the State in this connection. We are now proposing to pay a sum of £3,000 to make good the loss on the races so that the guarantors will not be called on to do so. We have already expended £5,500 on the improvement of the roads. Apparently, as Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out, the Board of Works gave the Phoenix Park to the R.I.A.C. for those days free of rent&mdash; certainly no Appropriation-in-Aid appears upon the Vote.  The expenditure consequent upon the holding of the races, arising out of which an increased number of motor cars were bought must also be taken into account.  The guarantors, the business community of the city of Dublin, have recently been exercising their vocal organs in objecting to the burden which is being placed upon their shoulders under the Relief of the Poor in Dublin Act. The Minister and the President will recollect that the business community in the city have been asking the State to give them some financial assistance to enable them to meet that burden.  But the Government, which refuses to facilitate the ratepayers of Dublin in their efforts to meet the charges arising out of the relief of the destitute, willingly and voluntarily comes along to provide a <Col N="53" /> sum of money to enable these people to avoid having to meet the loss upon the motor races which took place last year.  I think that this House would be acting in a most inadvisable manner if it passed this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I think that the holding of these races confers little or no benefit on the country.  An increase in the tourist traffic would have been of some benefit, but I do not think that the holding of these races contributed in any way to the tourist traffic.  The harm which they did, in so far as they encouraged the importation of a certain form of commodity which is not urgently required in the country, was greater than any possible good they might have done.  I think, therefore, that the Government should consider going further than refusing to make good this loss; they should consider also prohibiting the holding of such functions in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The case which has been put against this Vote is mainly that it is inadvisable and it is not good business to spend £3,000 on this particular service, and that there is an inconvenience to a large number of people by reason of the Park being closed for two days. Most of the rest of the arguments, so far as I heard them, were filling-up stuff, with a view to presenting perhaps as favourable a complexion to that particular criticism as was possible.  When we speak of a sum of £3,000 being a big sum, we speak in a relative manner.  If this sum be made available this year for this purpose, the races will be held in the Phoenix Park this year.  Last year, a sum of £5,500 was spent to put the course in order.  I do not know whether any of the Deputies who have spoken on this matter had conversations with any of those who took part in the races; I do not know whether they ever pay attention to the fact that races take place in other countries, and I do not know whether they advert to the fact that if people come here and see what suitable roads there are for motoring in this country they may tell their friends <Col N="54" /> about the suitability of the roads, with the possibility of having a greater number of visitors coming here in future&mdash;in other words, developing the tourist traffic.</P>
      <P>Assuming for the moment that all that Deputy Lemass has said is quite correct, and that we spent £5,500 last year in putting this course in order, what has been the effect?  We have had some of the most remarkable racing motorists in the world on the Phoenix Park course.  What was their verdict on it?  Perhaps the most celebrated of them stated to me that of all the courses over which he had ever travelled this was by far the best.  That was Colonel Campbell's tribute to the Phoenix Park course.  Is it likely that he has told anybody else that?  It is one of the peculiarities of motor racing that the course is the main consideration. That course was a safe course; a remarkable competition took place over two days, and not a single person was injured.  That was a great personal satisfaction to the members of the Royal Irish Automobile Club, to those who took part in the races, and to all the people who attended, and it was an advertisement in respect of the suitability of this country for a test of that sort of a character perhaps unequalled anywhere else.</P>
      <P>A sum of £5,500 spent on the part of the State to make that course suitable for that purpose was one of the main reasons, with the help of God, why we had no fatalities, no accidents, nothing to mar the great competition which took place on those two days last year.  Large numbers of people did not come, it is said. How do we know?  A considerable number of business people in the City of Dublin have come forward and they agreed to guarantee practically the same amount as was guaranteed last year.  If this sum is not voted, no races will take place this year. Was the sum that was voted last year voted only for the purpose of two days' races in that year?  Was that money all lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occasionally we hear representations from various sections of the <Col N="55" /> community for the spending of public money.  The money spent on these roads was mainly wages&mdash;more than half of it.  That is not money that is lost.  There has been a permanent improvement to the roads there.  The moving of the Phoenix monument was of very considerable advantage to the Park.  It was one of those things which might in the normal ordinary course have taken place, even if there was never a race meeting held there.  But the fact is that not alone did people come here, but that for a considerable portion of a week people in every country in Europe and a large number of people in America read about this contest, read of the large number of people taking part in it, and noted the fact that no fatality and no accident occurred on this racecourse.  The State spent £5,500 last year, and practically the only income in respect of a reduction of that was a sum of something like £1,400 received in connection with entertainment tax, so that the net cost may be put down at about £4,000.  This year much money will not be required to be spent on the course in order to enable another test to take place, and the putting up of this money by the State made it much more easy to get guarantees.  If this money is not voted, the guarantors of last year will presumably have to pay, no race meeting will be held next year, and no further information will go forth regarding the suitability of that course.</P>
    <P>It was a remarkable performance last year.  There were two great days in connection with motoring here.  I am one of those who, like the antediluvians on the far side of the House, would wish that the invention of the motor car had never been perfected, that we should be using horses and cars still, or saddle horses, but unlike them I do not seek to stop the tide with a pitchfork.  I admit that they have come and come to stay and that we ought to be in a position to provide for these modern inventions and to provide facilities in so far as it is possible within our limited means for such wonderful <Col N="56" /> contests as took place here last year. Again, if I were to adopt the phraseology of the Deputies opposite, I would say that larger numbers of people will attend the races this year. I think Deputies opposite who saw the performances, if they did not persist in these powerful economic principles which apparently agitate them when they are here, were certainly impressed by the remarkable exhibitions that took place.  Are the ordinary people of the State not to be afforded an opportunity, at the small cost involved, of seeing such contests simply because of Deputy Lemass's views on imports and exports? When these race meetings take place in America, they are advertised from one end of the continent to the other and are the subject of speech and consideration by the people, either the friends of those taking part or those interested in the contest.</P>
    <P>The cost this year, in so far as the State is concerned, will be relatively less.  A further advertisement of the advantages of this country to the motor-tourist will be provided at a small cost.  Those interested in the motoring business, of which I think the Deputies opposite can boast at least one member, are satisfied that it is good business.  I observe with some dismay that a Deputy who is usually on the front bench opposite is absent on this occasion.  I believe if we could manage to spirit him in here and if he was asked what was his deliberate opinion on the usefulness of this Vote he would say that it might be granted.</P>

      <P>According to a Press report, the President is one of the honorary members.  I am inclined to think that the President was speaking as an honorary member of the Club rather than as President of the Executive Council.  I intend to oppose this Vote and I believe Deputies on all benches should oppose it.  In the first place, I believe there is no justification for it; in the second place, I believe there is no necessity for it; and in the third place, I believe there is no national demand for it.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, it is not altogether the sum of £3,000 that we are asked to vote, because, according to our information, £5,500 has been already spent in carrying out certain improvements in the Phoenix Park, in preparing for the race, in widening the corners and removing the monument.  The President pointed out that most of the money spent on improvements in the Phoenix Park went in wages.  The President did not state the name of the firm that carried out the contract. I understand the firm that carried out the contract was the same Messrs.  Grainger Bros., of Hollywood, County Down, that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health refused to allow Rathmines Urban Council to give a contract to.  I believe the profit made out of the improvements carried out did not remain in the Saorstát owing to the fact that they were carried out by Messrs. Grainger Bros.  As Deputy Lemass also pointed out, there was a great outcry and hubbub in this House when it was asked to pass the Poor Relief Bill for Dublin City.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce, acting, I understand, through their spokesman, Deputy Good, strenuously objected to the money being expended as far as the poor people in the city of Dublin were concerned.  Deputy Good also informed the House that a resolution had been passed by Pembroke Urban Council objecting to the money being spent.</P>

      <P>For that particular purpose, which is tantamount to saying that Deputy Good was not prepared to agree to money being voted to help the poor and destitute in Dublin city.  But Deputy Good is now prepared by his silence to acquiesce in the voting of money to subsidise the Royal Irish Automobile Club&mdash;or, in other words, to subsidise the British motor industry.  The President maintains that that money was well spent.  I would recall to the President's mind what he said in this House when speaking on housing some time ago.  He said that for every £ expended they expected to get a £ in return.  I would like to know if this State spends £8,500 in order to subsidise these races what return this State is going to get?  It has been suggested that the tourist traffic in Dublin is going to be improved and that the hotel keepers are going to make something out of it.  If that is so, why not let the Dublin hotel keepers pay the £3,000 themselves?  It seems to me that by voting this money the Government are extraordinarily lavish in comparison with what they did on another occasion.  Before the House adjourned for ten weeks, we on these benches raised the question of unemployment, and we were told by members on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches that they were not prepared to vote any money for unemployment, that they were not prepared to provide any money for the hungry and destitute throughout the country.  Now we are asked to vote £3,000, in addition to the £5,500 already expended, in order to subsidise international motor racing in the Phoenix Park.  It has been referred to as &ldquo;international motor racing.&rdquo;  Was it really international <Col N="59" /> motor racing?  Did one Irish car take part in the race?  I consider that the plea put forward that these races are going to help the tourist traffic does not carry very much weight.  The President will remember that during the Tailteann Games there were many more tourists attracted to Dublin than were attracted during the Phoenix Park motor races, while at the same time the Government only gave a loan to the Tailteann Games Committee. Why not insist in this case that it should be a loan and that it should be paid back.  I think it is absolutely scandalous, because I believe by this Vote the Government, as the custodians of the public purse, are callously squandering money, while all over the country there is poverty and unemployment, and emigration is rampant owing to the fact that there are not enough industries in the country, more especially in the Gaeltacht area.</P>
      <P>When we, on these benches, advocated that four or five or six hundred pounds should be allocated in Donegal for the purpose of setting up carding and breaking plant for the Donegal home-spinning industry we were met with a blank refusal. While the Government are not prepared to vote money to people to keep them from destitution, and from emigrating, they are prepared to subsidise wealthy people who are members of the Automobile Club for their sport.  If we examine the personnel of this club we shall find that they are all wealthy people.  If they are wealthy people and want to have sport or motor races they should pay for them, instead of asking the taxpayers of the country to subsidise them.  I ask the House to reject this Vote because I think it is a piece of class legislation.  It is a request made in the interests of the wealthy classes at the expense of the poorer classes of the community.</P>

      <P>I could quite understand the opposition to this proposal from Deputy O'Hanlon or from other Deputies coming from country districts, <Col N="60" /> but I cannot understand the opposition of Deputies from Dublin, because vast sums of money were brought into Dublin by the influx of persons from all over the world in connection with the motor race in the Phoenix Park.  It is not necessary for Deputy O'Kelly to go to a hotel because he has his own house to go to, but I can tell him no person from the country could get a bed in a hotel in Dublin for love or money for over a week before the date of the motor race.  Any money that we can spend in bringing people into this country and especially people who have money to spend themselves, is well spent.  It is not taxation; it is reproductive.  The Irish Tourist Development Association are pressing the Government to give them a grant.  I may say this that tourist traffic was increased by almost one million last year.  In 1929, there were three millions spent by people attracted into this country, mostly by the activity of the Irish Tourist Development Association.  People have different ideas of attraction. A lot of people will go to the Grand National, a lot will go to Punchestown, but there are a lot of people interested in the motor business and motor racing and you will not bring them into this country unless for that particular thing.  I believe motor racing is going to grow.  Such people coming into the country will spend money and I believe you will have a much larger muster of people coming into the country this year than last year.  I must say that the opposition of Dublin Deputies on this matter is a cause of very great surprise to me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shaw seems to be surprised at the opposition offered by Dublin Deputies to this Vote.  As a Dublin Deputy, I oppose it absolutely, and I have various reasons for doing so.  First of all, it is ridiculous that those people who guaranteed the money, and who in the ordinary way would be called upon to pay up this guarantee, should come to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to release them because the thing was not quite a success from the point of <Col N="61" /> view of money.  I also happen to know that guarantors are got by in ducements given to them by offering them certain facilities.  They want it both ways.  They are to get free admission and other facilities and if it does not pay we are to pay, but if it does pay who are to get the profits? I think Deputy Cassidy hit the nail on the head when he made a comparison between the attitude adopted by the Government, on this matter, and the help given to the Tailteann Games.  In the Tailteann Games we had a national interest.  I do not believe the money was ever repaid, but it was only a loan to the Committee. I object absolutely from this point of view also.  Deputy Shaw pointed out that the hotels were overflowing during the motor race week, and that there was no accommodation for many people.  If these people benefited to this extent and if there is amongst the guarantors people that make profit as a result of the race, why release them from the guarantee which they have given?  I say we should be very definite about this. The State is not running this competition, it is the Automobile Club who are running it.  They have the backing of the State inasmuch as the State provides them with what the President says is the safest course in the world.  There is enough to be done in Dublin City apart altogether from the rest of the country.  Even if this £3,000 could be kept for the city it would do good among the poorer classes.  They have a better claim to it than the Irish Automobile Club, which possibly will be looking for the same guarantee next year if we establish this precedent of relieving them from the responsibility they incur this year in addition to the facilities they are getting.  I hope the House will reject this proposal and save us in the future from having such discussions upon questions of this nature.</P>

      <P>I often wonder where Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches have acquired what I will describe as their depressed mentality regarding the conditions existing in this country; why it is they love to stand forward and tell the rest of the world what a poor, miserable race we are, and why we can afford to pay for nothing.  I happened to see a comment in a newspaper in September last&mdash;a paper whose Irish correspondent is a member of the other House of the Oireachtas, a gentleman who loves to stick pins into the people of this country and to make finicky little points against them.  This comment by this eminent correspondent of a Sunday newspaper was published on the 8th September last, and it occurred to me at once that it was exactly the type of comment and argument that would appeal to Deputies opposite.  I said: &ldquo;I shall keep this extract by me, because the Fianna Fáil Deputies are sure to use it.&rdquo;  The arguments addressed to the House upon this question to-day are taken practically word for word from what appeared in the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; of the 8th September last.  It is headed &ldquo;The Government and Motor Racing,&rdquo; and it goes on to express wonder at the interest that the authorities take in motor racing.  It suggests that an amount is to be paid, and it is hoped that the guarantors will then be agreeable to renew the guarantees for next year's race, when a profit is expected.  It states that the Dáil is hardly likely to pass money without protest, not on account of the amount but on account of the principle.  That is a <Col N="63" /> very excellent summary in, perhaps, better language, of the speeches that have been addressed to the House this afternoon by Deputies O'Kelly, Lemass and others.  I do not think these gentlemen ought to parade before this House and adopt the views of the correspondent of the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; who seems to be paid for the purpose of sticking pins in the authorities of this country at every opportunity.  As a Dublin Deputy, I strongly support the proposed grant because the motor race brought great numbers of people to the city of Dublin, and is likely to bring a great many more in the future.  I ask Deputies opposite not to pursue this policy of telling the rest of the world that we are so very poor and so miserable that we cannot afford to pay for anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rice is afraid that this Party is suffering from a depressed mentality.  Although our political fortunes up to the present have not been quite so successful as Deputy Rice's, I can assure him that we do not suffer from any depression. So long as we feel that we speak here for the common people we are not likely to suffer from a depressed mentality.  It has happened on a few occasions that quotations from the foreign Press have been brought in here.  I do not think that Deputy Rice is enlarging his own reputation or the reputation of his Party by having to fall back upon the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; or upon any other English paper.  As far as we are concerned, we are just as anxious to keep out the English newspapers as the English motor cars.  This particular correspondent of the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; seems to pinprick the Government terribly.  The Government have an opportunity of answering that gentleman.  I do not know that they would even have to go to the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; to answer it. I do not really know what Deputy Rice's grievance is.  As far as I can see, people like Deputy Rice, and those who have recently been sent to America on behalf of the Government, have managed to put a very <Col N="64" /> favourable picture in front of these people who have had the good luck to read their effusions as to the wonderfully prosperous condition of this country.  Surely to goodness Deputy Rice is not going to put the correspondent of the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; a paper which is read by a very small body of people&mdash;it is not one of the popular Sunday weeklies, I think&mdash; against the wonderful publicity that Deputy General McKeon and other representatives of his Party have got in America for the prosperity that we have got here.  Our attitude in regard to this is, that if it can be shown that this project, or any similar project, is going to be a benefit to the country, particularly if it is going to develop the country industrially or culturally, or if it is going to be in line with the traditions of the people, there is a strong case for it.  But this is not in the nature of the Tailteann Games, as has been pointed out; neither is it in the nature of the Dublin Horse Show; or of the proposed industrial exhibition in connection with that Show.  It is not going to help Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputies who have said that it is not helping the Irish Tourist Traffic.  The fact is that no matter how we perfect our roads or our hotels we cannot perfect our climate.  We have always that barrier of the climate which will prevent the richer class of Americans and other foreigners from coming here.  They are not going to come here if they can go to the South of France and various other places where they can get the sun.  We are going to get a particular class of people&mdash;I hope we will get more of them in future&mdash; people of our own race and kindred. If we want to attract these people here, it is by developing functions like the Tailteann Games and the Horse Show, which have some connection with the country instead of things quite foreign to it like motor races.  Motor races are no more in line with the opinions of the common people than picture houses.  In fact, the ordinary people, who see the state of unemployment or depression <Col N="65" /> existing&mdash;whether the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government or the people themselves are responsible for it it is there&mdash;will not like to see discussions of this nature going on. They do not like to see money being spent on these projects.  They want to see us coming together on industrial matters, on the building up of the country.  I do not think that the President really can be serious when he says that there was employment given out of this in connection with the removal of the Phoenix monument. The removal of that monument was only a very small job.</P>
    <P>As regards the motor trade, we are just as sympathetic to the claims of the motor trade.  We have unfortunately, as in the distributing trades generally, large bodies of people engaged selling foreign articles. While they are there we must try to give them a chance to exist.  This Party is not out to drive them out of business.  We are out to encourage them as far as we can to carry on their business.  At the same time, we must recognise that there is a wrong trend; that there are too many luxuries being inported into the country; that the country is setting up a standard of living out of all proportion to the standard in other countries.  If the Government Party feel that the country has sufficient resources, sufficient capital reserves behind it, to withstand all that kind of thing and that our people can live at that rate, well and good, but I do not agree with them.</P>
    <P>I think, as has frequently been urged on this side of the House, we ought to tighten our belts.  We ought not to ask the underdog to tighten his belt.  We ought to ask the people who have the world's goods in their hands, and who are able to enjoy themselves while other people are starving, to tighten their belts a little and cut down this unnecessary expenditure.  They ought to turn their attention to developing the country with the money they are sending out of it not alone for motor cars, but for foreign investments. They ought to turn their attention to their own country, and if they are really interested in it let them realise <Col N="66" /> that before we can have these things, before we can have our city as we would like to have it, we must have prosperity in our city.  Those who talk about the tourist traffic seem to forget, in the first place, that the English Press almost boycotted these motor races.  It did not give them nearly the same publicity as the Belfast races.  In connection with anything that we try to start in Dublin we will always have that canker in the anti-Irish Press in London.  How are we going to get their support? In my opinion, we ought to turn round and try to develop our country and cure the ills of our people.  We ought to try to develop our industry and give the people the feeling, which they are very badly in need of, that all Parties in this House are trying to unite and to get together on things that really matter; on things that will keep our people at home; on things that will build up the country and that will not have us in the position we are in at present, that we have a large body of people saying that Dublin is a wonderful city. If our foreign visitors only go into the slums what are they going to see? Even those who left the country when the Treaty was signed and who are now very anxious to come back if they can only get the same facilities, or even a portion of the facilities that they had in the old times, are coming back now and their correspondents tell us that Dublin is very shabby and dreary.  I think we can do without that class of people.  I do not agree with Deputy Shaw or others who say that these people are going to advertise Ireland.  Ireland must first stand on her own legs and provide work for her own population and forget this thing of constantly persuading the people that they are living in a paradise when they know themselves that they are living in a very different condition.</P>

      <P>This debate has been remarkably interesting, not so much because of its subject, which is, after all, not such a hugely important subject, but because of the curious, fresh revelation it has given of the point of view of the second <Col N="67" /> largest political Party in the country about the prospects of this country. I was very interested to hear Deputy Derrig adding to the other aspects of his Party's policy the additional plank of informing prospective tourists that they ought not to come to this country for fear they might get too wet.  I did not know that the Fianna Fáil Party were going in for depreciating our climate as well as for depreciating everything else they can think of depreciating.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Derrig wants me to do is to go out and tell Americans to be very careful not to come to Ireland under any circumstances because the climate is too bad.  It is a magnificent slogan on which to base the prosperity of the tourist industry.  People in other lands who want to bring prosperity to their country do so by boosting their industries, but here the Fianna Fáil Party apparently hope to bring prosperity to this country by a process of de-boosting everything that they can think of.  The Fianna Fáil method of advertising our national wares reminds me of the beggars that one sees seated at the gates of oriental cities showing their sores to passers-by and looking for alms from them.  This attitude of mind is being sedulously cultivated by the Fianna Fáil Party for one simple political purpose and no other.  It seems to me to be one of the most serious dangers that, at the present time, we have to contend against in this country.  We cannot get anywhere in industry, or in anything else, if a large proportion of our people spend all their time announcing to the world what miserable, unfortunate, God-forsaken wretches we are, and how rotten everything in our country is, including the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of a few thousand pounds which it is proposed to give to the Royal Irish Automobile Club is on the same level as the whole <Col N="68" /> series of grants which the State gives to all sorts of ventures of this kind.

      <P>The question of when a loan is not a loan is not so serious a question as when an oath is not an oath.  If the money was not paid back, it does not seem to make a vast lot of difference whether it was a loan or a grant.  A loan that is not paid back becomes a gift by the lapse of time.  There are a great many other ventures of this kind to which the State contributes in one way or another.  I do not see that, in asking the taxpayers to pay a contribution of this kind, we are asking them to do anything extraordinary. In all probability far more money than is involved in this grant will be recouped to the Exchequer, in motor taxation alone, as a result of the holding of the motor races. There is no doubt but that, as a result of the holding of the motor races and of similar undertakings, far more money will come into the Exchequer than it is proposed to pay out by means of this grant.  It is a matter of laying out the national money to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply claptrap to bring the question of unemployment and such matters into a question like this. One could get up and complain against grants being made to the Universities or for the financing of publications in Irish so long as there was unemployment in the country, and you could then proceed to inform <Col N="69" /> the world that the people of this country are so miserable, so wretched and so poor that they have no money to spend on anything.

This was an interjected remark by Deputy Derrig running down the climate of this country, and as it may be the subject of comment again I just wish to deal <Col N="70" /> with it.  We are dealing with a matter that would not be financed in the way in which it is being financed but for the tourist traffic in this country, and what that means not only to Dublin City but to the rest of the country.  Apparently with no knowledge, comparatively speaking, of the climate, Deputy Derrig for the benefit of all concerned, and of foreigners particularly, decries our climate.  He referred particularly to what Americans think of it.  It was a real live American who, without any necessity at all but from his own desire makes his home in this country for at least ten months of the year, who explained his attitude in the matter to me in these words: &ldquo;What brings men like me here to live in your country is your wonderful climate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Tierney rebuked us for dragging in the unemployed into every debate in which we can do it.  We have no apology to make to Deputy Tierney or to anybody else for doing that.  The unemployment problem in this country is the greatest national problem that we have to face&mdash;one of them at least.  When President Cosgrave talked about Deputy Lemass depriving people of the privilege of seeing the motor races, I think he should go down the streets of Dublin and have a chat with ordinary persons who are hungry.  He will find, I think, that these people are more concerned at being deprived of their bacon and eggs than at not being able to see the motor races once a year.  If we spend the money that we collect from the people in providing them with good food, good houses and good clothes we will, I think, be doing far more for the country than in attracting tourists, whether they come from America or anywhere else.  We have no objection to American tourists coming along, but the object of the Government should be to provide for the comforts of their own people and not for the comforts of tourists.  Our first duty should be to provide for <Col N="71" /> our own people.  If we do that then it will be all right for the tourists to come along.  We have not deboosted our industries or our people, as Deputy Tierney has alleged.</P>
      <P>We recognise that in this country we have as good a people as any other country.  Given a proper opportunity, they would provide for themselves and those who come after them in as good a fashion as the people of any other country, but we certainly want to de-bunk a lot of lies told about the prosperity of the country by President Cosgrave and those associated with him.  Cumann na nGaedheal thinks the country is going to be all right when they have fine picture houses in O'Connell Street and motor races once in twelve months.  The country would be better off if the £3,000 spent on the motor races were put into some reproductive industry.  That would be much better than opening a picture house in O'Connell Street with great and fulsome praise of foreign companies. There is one way in which that £3,000 might be spent.  We saw recently in the papers where the Royal Dublin Society, which control the Horse Show, were not able to put on an exhibition of Irish industries at the Horse Show because the Irish manufacturers who came forward did not contribute sufficient money to make the exhibition possible.  The Horse Show attracts a great many people to the country.  If the visitors the Horse Show brings to the country saw Irish instead of foreign goods, that would be doing something. If this £3,000 were spent in enabling Irish manufacturers to exhibit their goods to foreigners, the money would be much better spent than in giving it to assist motor races.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I am not going to talk of unemployment, and I am not going to use that very bad word &ldquo;de-boost&rdquo; which Deputy Tierney used, and which I suggest should be &ldquo;non-boost,&rdquo; I will not talk of the South Dublin election either.  I want to talk of tourist traffic.  If the Government is serious <Col N="72" /> in the development of tourist traffic, I suggest that the opportunity to assist it has been very often offered in the past three or four years.  I am a member of an association appointed by the county council as a contributory body, and I know that association has repeatedly given the Government the opportunity of helping the tourist traffic, and of enlightening those who want to know about the beauties and amenities of the country. I know that if we concentrated in other directions, infinitely more would be done for tourist development. If the Department of External Affairs gave instructions to their representatives abroad, especially in America, they would do more for tourist traffic than could be done by bringing people to see motor races in the Phoenix Park.  I suggest there is no use in talking of tourist traffic in connection with this Vote.  The question of supporting tourist traffic has often been put up to the Government, and as far as I know it has given very little help to those who are endeavouring to develop the traffic.</P>

      <P>We have heard a good deal about the advantages derived by Dublin from these motor races.  I wonder how many Deputies who have spoken in support of this Vote would go down the country and explain to the farmers and the farm labourers how the expenditure of this money is going to benefit them?  I have met several of them recently and they asked me: &ldquo;What are you going to do about voting money for these motor races?&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;If you vote for it you will hear about it.  What advantage is that money to us?&rdquo;  If motor-making was an Irish industry its encouragement would be a laudable thing, but as it is we are simply engaged in distributing the foreign goods.  The opinion of the plain people in this country is worth having on matters of this kind.  Some plain talking could be heard with regard to the roads.  We expend millions on the roads, and yet the vast majority of the people cannot travel these roads safely.  A considerable number, probably <Col N="73" /> the majority, of the ratepayers are living some distance from the main roads, and they have to use roads that have been sedulously neglected during the past few years. When they leave their farms and get out on these roads in many cases they find them water-logged and very dangerous to use.  The newly-made motor roads are even more dangerous, as they have been constructed for the benefit only of motorists.  We are asked to spend this money on encouraging the motoring industry, a foreign industry from which we derive no benefit. I will be sorry for those who vote for this when they face their constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no doubt that if the expenditure of £3,000 results in the Phoenix Park races becoming a definite annual fixture the money will be very well spent indeed, and that if it were necessary to spend a larger sum to secure that object the money would be very well spent.  Deputy Shaw, I think very correctly, said that different people are induced by different things to come to this country.  Some people come because of the Horse Show.  They may go through the country and spend a good deal of time in it.  The prestige of the Horse Show is what decides them to come here.  There will be many other people if the motor races become an annual function who will be influenced to come here by those. They will go through the country and spend, perhaps, very considerable sums, and they will induce other people to come.  I believe, or I would not propose this motion, that the tourist traffic in this country can be developed enormously.  I do not believe that in the volume of tourist traffic we could attract we would be able to compete with countries like, say.  Switzerland, but I believe that millions per annum would be spent in the country by the development of the tourist traffic.  For the development of tourist traffic, I believe it is worth expending State money in various ways, for, as I said, different people are differently attracted to <Col N="74" /> spend money in various ways.  It is because we believe that the establishment of the motor races as an annual function will help the tourist traffic we propose to vote the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the motor races had been going on successfully for three or four years and made a loss in one year, we would not come to the Dáil and ask that this money be voted.  If the motor races are held in 1930 and fail, we will not come to the Dáil and ask it to vote money, but we thought it was singularly unfortunate that in the first year of the races a deficit occurred.  We were satisfied that if another appeal had to be made to the guarantors it would be found impossible to get sufficient guarantees to enable the races to be held a second time.  We feel that the races are of sufficient importance to be given a second chance.  By holding the races this year alone we will recoup the Exchequer the £3,000.  If the attendance is at all bigger than last year we will get £1,500 in entertainment tax.  If somewhat more successful, we might easily get £2,000 in entertainment tax alone. It would not require a large consumption of dutiable articles, of a liquid or another kind, to get another £1,000.  If we get a larger number of people from Northern Ireland, or from any other country, to come to these races, we will get more than £3,000 into the Exchequer. There is no use in talking as if, as Deputy Aiken said, this was taking bacon and eggs&mdash;I do not know whether or not he said out of the mouths of the unemployed.  This money, I believe, will come back to the Exchequer as a result of races in one year, and if the races become an annual fixture they will bring a great deal more money into the country.  There is no use in thinking of going back to the Stone Age. There might be grounds for taking further steps, greater than any we have taken, to get motors made here. But whether we do that now or at a future time, or whether we decide not to do it at all, I think there is no use in trying to push the country backwards.  The country has certain <Col N="75" /> attractions for motorists.  It has roads that are not so crowded.  If that factor were fully availed of we could make a great deal of money and give a great deal of employment.  Some Deputy, in the course of the debate, said that we should think of the people before the tourists.  We are not trying to attract tourists here for the benefit of the tourists; we are trying to attract them for the benefit of the people of the country.</P>

I could understand a debate of the character that we have had here about this particular Vote if the sum that was being asked for was in the nature of £60,000 or something of that kind.

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929 (Seanad)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which has come down from the Seanad.  It is not in any way a political or party measure and possibly the House will agree to the Second Reading of it.  It may be that the House might consider it advisable to amend the Bill in Committee.  I suggest to the House that it would be well to have the Second Reading carried.  The provisions of the Bill are roughly these:&mdash;A close season is established for all wild birds and that season is from the 1st March to the 1st August.  Any person who kills a wild bird during that period is subject to certain penalties set out in the statute, but if the County Council thinks there is reason to the contrary it is open to them to make application to the Minister for Justice who can make a special order dealing with each county. These penalties do not apply to the owners of land, who can shoot all classes of birds on their own land or authorise other persons to shoot all classes of birds except a number of birds the names of which are set out in the first schedule.  Possibly some of these birds in the first schedule should not be protected. However, that is a question which the House could consider on the Committee Stage.  In addition to that there is prohibition in regard to the export of a rather limited number of birds.  The names of the birds the export of which from this country is prohibited are set out in the second schedule.  They are principally birds of the song-bird type and they include other birds such as the peregrine falcon and kingfisher. <Col N="79" /> Under the statute persons are prohibited from taking wild birds in a certain fashion.  For instance, no one may:</P>
      <P>(a)  use as a scarecrow any live bird which is tethered, or</P>
      <P>(b)  use as a decoy any live bird which is tethered or is secured by means of braces or other similar appliances or which is blind, maimed or injured, or</P>
      <P>(c)  use bird-lime or any substance of a like nature for the purpose of taking or capturing alive or attempting to take or capture alive any wild bird, or</P>
      <P>(d)  take or attempt to take any wild bird by means of a hook or other similar instrument.</P>
      <P>That is dealt with in Section 4, and any person doing those things shall be guilty of an offence.  Under Section 5 it is made illegal to set what is known as a pole-trap; that is, a trap on the top of a stick or a mound or things of that nature which used at one time to be the ordinary method of trapping hawks.  There are certain provisions as to the size of the cage in which the bird shall be carried; and, too, the eggs of wild birds cannot be destroyed.  These are roughly the general principles underlying the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. Doyle Mr. E. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the principle of the Bill, especially in regard to the protection of eggs and young birds.  Section 4, however, prohibits people from doing certain things, such as using as a scarecrow any live bird which is tethered. The Minister has made no case against the tethering of birds or against securing birds by means of braces for the purposes of caging them.  What is the difference between tethering a bird and tethering a goat?  What cruelty is there in tethering a bird?  If there were, there would be no possibility of a bird attracting others so that they might be caught.  I am totally opposed to Section 4.  The use of bird-lime is also forbidden, and if that <Col N="80" /> section is adopted it will deprive a number of people of employment for a long period of the year.  That is the main reason why I oppose that section.  I am also against Section 6, which prohibits the keeping of birds in cages.  As a matter of fact, there is nothing to prevent foreign birds being brought in and confined in cages, but we are not allowed to keep our own birds in cages.  A number of people make a living out of cage birds.  Section 9 prohibits the export of certain wild birds mentioned in the second schedule, and in that connection also a large number of people make a living.  As any gardener, or other person familiar with fruit-growing will tell you, bullfinches, which are mentioned in schedule 2, have to be shot in order to prevent them from destroying fruit.  Despite that, however, the Minister includes them amongst the birds which are not allowed to be exported.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say that goldfinches are scarce because they are trapped and snared, but I would point out to him that it is the Minister for Agriculture who is really responsible for their scarcity. The Minister for Justice is surely aware that goldfinches feed their young on the seeds of thistles at certain portions of the year, and as they and deprived of that food under certain Acts passed here they are becoming scarce.  I would be glad if the Minister and the House would agree to amend Sections 4, 6 and 9 so as to prevent a number of people, who find a livelihood in pursuit of this business, becoming unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached by a number of people in my constituency and asked to oppose the passage of this Bill on much the same grounds as those advanced by Deputy Doyle.  There are a number of unemployed persons in Dublin who make a precarious livelihood by catching and rearing song birds, and, in my opinion, the economic situation that exists here is not sufficiently good to justify our embarking upon schemes of this nature, if by doing so we are going to make it <Col N="81" /> more difficult for certain human beings to subsist.  I know that there are a number of individuals whose hearts bleed when they think of the hardships inflicted on little birds, but who are not in the least worried about individuals who have no employment, and who are deprived of the means of providing the necessaries of life for themselves and their families.  Deputies will, I am sure, consider human needs first.  Undoubtedly there are a number of individuals who are keeping the wolf from the door by catching and selling wild birds.  If the Bill is going to interfere, as apparently it is, with the livelihood of these people I will oppose it.  If conditions improve, and if the economic situation becomes better, so that there is a reasonable prospect for those persons finding employment in other spheres we can then afford to indulge in luxury legislation of this kind, but at present we cannot do so.  We must put the necessities of human beings before those of wild birds.  It is possible that the Bill may be amended in this respect in Committee, but, if not, I will be compelled to vote against it on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. Wolfe Mr. G. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill gives prospect of being a very good one.  If it is amended in certain particulars, I do not see how it will be oppressive on anybody who earns a legitimate living in this connection. If it were only for the sake of getting into one Act the different Acts that deal with wild birds I think that this Bill would serve a useful purpose.  Not only does it do that, but it also makes provision for a close time for wild birds, a provision which did not exist before.  I think that we all want to have as many wild birds about us as we possibly can.  I regret to say that I observe a great diminution in their numbers, particularly of the more beautiful and rare specimens, as contrasted with the numbers which I used to see when I was young.  I do not know the reason for that, but I notice in my part of the country considerably fewer birds of the kind <Col N="82" /> that are not only an ornament but of great use to the country.  Many farmers think that birds are a great detriment to them, and they think that because they light on their seeds everything is going to be destroyed. I had that idea myself once.  I do a good deal of farming, and nearly every year my manager complains that the oats and other crops are being destroyed by the presence of birds.  As a matter of fact, with the sowing instruments which we have in these days these birds do uncommonly little harm.  In fact, they do a great deal more good than harm, and if it were not for them we would have many more enemies in the insect line to contend with than we have to-day.  Any little harm which they do can be easily remedied by taking proper measures against them.  I do not think that anybody can really say that it is a humane thing to tether or blind birds for the purpose of using them as decoys to catch other birds.  I do not think that there is anything commendable in that, nor do I think that there is anything elevating in the nature of a person who does such a thing as that.  I know that some people do it because I have seen them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.  Personally I think that the use of bird-lime is a thing that should not be allowed and I think that section is a very useful one.  Of course everything is subject to alteration and it may be amended and improved if it is oppressive.  I am opposed to keeping birds in cages at all, but I think if you must keep them in cages, at any rate the cages should be of decent size and nobody should be allowed to keep comparatively large birds in tiny cages in which frequently they cannot move their wings.  I think it is a cruelty and an abomination.  I note that the Bill also deals with the taking of eggs, particularly in regard to the lapwing. We know the benefits conferred on the country and on farmers especially by the lapwing.  It even <Col N="83" /> destroys the germ which produces fluke.  I think Section 11 is a very good section.  Anybody may ask a person, whom he knows to be committing an offence, for his name and address.  I think that is an extremely good provision.  Formerly you could not do it, or if you did you would be told to mind your own business. Under this Act you will have that right.  I think that altogether there are great possibilities for good in this measure, and though it may be necessary to amend it&mdash;possibly some of the names of birds may be taken from the different schedules,&mdash;I hope the House will give it a Second Reading. I think it is well worthy the consideration of anybody possessed of any humane feelings at all and I hope it will be passed into law.</P>

      <P>I do not find myself altogether in agreement with all that has been said in opposition to the Bill.  I believe if this kind of unlimited licence to destroy and kill these birds, in some cases useful and in most cases really pretty, is allowed, we ultimately will reach the stage when these birds will be decimated if not altogether annihilated. At the same time I think the Minister might consider the advisability from time to time, of allowing the killing off of birds which might be a pest in certain parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I would like to see it clear.  I am rather interested in one phase of the Bill, and I would ask the Minister if, at a later stage, he will consider the desirability of establishing a number of bird sanctuaries throughout the country.  I have in mind a particular spot in my own area within a couple of miles of the city where a number of so-called sportsmen congregate in the evenings and frequently on Sunday mornings.  The place I refer to is known as the Lough, and is situated in the south-western portion of the city of Cork.  Whilst other countries are making very admirable efforts to <Col N="84" /> encourage the propagation of wild fowl and other birds on artificial lakes, we have in the very near vicinity of Cork a beautiful natural lake where these wild birds&mdash;wild duck, snipe and other wild fowl&mdash; come from time to time.  A number of these so-called sportsmen who very seldom soil their boots, drive along in motor cars and shoot down these wild birds.  That happens while many other countries, as I have said, are making decent efforts to provide subjects for nature studies in places to which children can be brought to see birds in their wild state.  I would ask the Minister if he would be prepared to include in the Bill a clause which would make these particular spots, with a radius of a quarter of a mile of the surrounding country, bird sanctuaries.</P>

      <P>So far, it appears to me, the Civic Guard are powerless in matters of this kind.  I know that when I was shooting&mdash;and I am still following the pastime&mdash;we always recognised that we were not allowed to shoot within forty yards of the public road.  The place to which I refer is only fifteen to twenty yards off the public road, and indiscriminate shooting is carried on there.  I do hope the Minister will at some future date include an amendment to preserve such places as sanctuaries and prevent birds from being shot there.</P>

      <P>I have not had an opportunity of perusing this Bill as thoroughly as I would like, but during the few moments I have been reading it and listening to other speakers who have taken part in the debate, I decided to support the Bill. I think it is urgently needed.  At the same time I do not agree with all the <Col N="85" /> clauses in the Bill.  In Section 4, clause (c), there is mention of the use of bird-lime or any substance of a like nature for the purpose of taking or capturing alive, or attempting to take or capture alive, any wild bird.  I do not think it is unduly cruel to use bird-lime in capturing birds.  I have never used it myself, although I have been hunting birds ever since I was able to carry a gun.  I take a very deep interest both in game birds and native birds, and I do not see where hardship or pain to the birds could arise if this bird-lime is used in a humane manner.  I certainly put the pleasure of humanity before the pleasure of the birds.  I am now referring to song-birds.  If Deputies recollect that in our Irish cities and towns, just as in cities in other countries, there are some very unhappy people and very poor people, I do not see why these song-birds cannot be utilised to bring a ray of sunshine into their lives.  For that reason I do not approve of this clause.  I fail to see why a singing bird cannot be captured in a humane manner, and treated in a humane manner, by the poorer classes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The title of the Bill is the &ldquo;Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929.&rdquo;  I do not know if this Bill embraces any birds besides the birds mentioned in the Schedules but there is certainly one bird that I would show no mercy to at all and that is the gannet.  The gannet, as everyone knows who takes an interest in fishing, does tremendous damage to our salmon and trout fisheries and I would give that gentleman very short shrift indeed. It is also mentioned in the Bill that no bird shall be used to scare off other birds.  I should have no hesitation whatever in using the scald crow.  On the Game Preservation Bill, I said that various types of hawks and magpies did incalculable damage to the young game birds.  I, as an old gunman, would have great pleasure in stringing up every scald crow, most types of hawk and the majority of magpies. At the same time, I welcome this Bill.  I think it is a good Bill <Col N="86" /> and I certainly think that the time has come when some deterrent, such as this Bill, was introduced to put a stop to cruelty of any kind to any variety of bird.  If we had not the birds, in a very short time we would have no vegetation.  The amount of good which birds do to agriculture and to the land generally is incalculable. I remember reading some time ago about the thousands of flies per day the swallow catches.  He lives on flies practically.  With regard to various kinds of bullfinches and similar types of bird, though they may inflict some loss on the owners of orchards and possibly on the farmers, to a limited extent, still the amount of harm they do is outweighed to a great extent by the amount of good that they do to the farmer in eating up all kinds of pests in the ground.  I intend to support this Bill provided certain minor changes are made in it.  Taken all round, with the exception of the few points that I have spoken against, I think it is a good Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in opposing this Bill.  It is splendid to hear a Deputy advocate that certain birds should be protected in order that, after a certain period, we would have the right to kill these birds, and that certain other birds should be protected not because they were not worth killing but because certain unhappy people have the right to make the birds unhappy in order that two unhappy creatures should be together, the result being happiness.  It would be splendid, too, if those who advocate so tenderly the cause and the lives of the birds would be as eloquent in times of war and advocate the protection of human lives as sedulously as they advocate the protection of birds.  That is the logic of the illogic of the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am opposing the Bill is that you are depriving a number of human beings of their livelihood If this Bill becomes law, a number of people in the rural areas will have no way of living.  The second Schedule prohibits the exportation of the goldfinch and the bullfinch.  In my part <Col N="87" /> of the country, there are a great number of goldfinches caught.  It is a trade.  They are sent by the dozen to Belfast, and shipped from there to England, and you are going to knock these men out of employment if you prohibit the exportation of these birds.  With reference to Section 4, if you prevent bird-catchers catching birds by the use of the scare-crow, of a decoy which is tethered, of bird-lime, or by means of a hook or similar instrument, how are they going to catch birds?  Put a grain of salt on their tails?  Is that the method the advocates of the Bill put forward as the way to catch birds?  These are the recognised ways of the bird-catchers who want to catch sufficient birds to pay for their day out.  If you do away with all these methods it means putting up the shutters for these people.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Wolfe regretting the scarcity of birds.  One of the reasons for the scarcity of birds is the lack of forestry in this country. The more hedges, ditches, hollies, hazels and laurels you allow to be cut down the fewer birds you will have.  Unfortunately, in the division of estates in the country, when the farms are divided up down comes the hedges and trees.  The bird population of that district diminishes, and no matter what protective measures you have here, when you do away with that shrub and forest, the bird population will go.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Anthony advocate bird sanctuaries.  They are all right in their way, but a thorough application of the Forestry Bill will do more than ten Bills of this sort to preserve the bird population in this country. As I think Deputy Lemass said, it would be an ideal thing in an ideal State, when everything else would be put in order, to have a measure like this, but things are as they are. People are getting it very hard to live, and I think we should hesitate in passing this Bill, as it would do away with a large amount of needed employment, the employment of bird-catching for export in particular. The bird-catchers in my area make <Col N="88" /> their livelihood by exporting to England and Scotland.</P>

      <P>I hope the House will give this Bill a Second Reading, leaving such amendments as it thinks necessary to a later stage.  I think the House ought to refuse to be impressed by the argument about causing unemployment to a certain small number of people if the alternative is to allow the continuance of a traffic which is carried on under the most inhuman conditions.  We have all seen the operations of some of those people for whom so much sympathy was expressed by Deputy Kennedy and Deputy Doyle.  We have seen in a small cage, in which one bird would not have enough room to spread its wings, a dozen of these unfortunate creatures.  I do not know how long they are kept in those cages.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Dr. White advocate the continuance of the use of bird-lime. From my observation, I would say that one of the most inhuman things in this trade is the use of bird-lime. These bird-catchers go out and catch finches and linnets with bird-lime. They proceed to release the hen-birds, which are no use to them as marketable articles.  These birds, as a rule, die a miserable and lingering death afterwards.  When they perch on bushes or trees, they are stuck to the branches by the bird-lime and they die of starvation.  That is the traffic that Deputy Dr. White wants <Col N="89" /> to see continued.  I have heard a lot from Deputies on the opposite benches about the iniquities of the Minister for Agriculture.  I did not know that one of his great sins was the destruction of thistles in this country.  Apparently, it is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the shortage of goldfinches.  The goldfinch is one of the most beautiful of the native birds of this country.  The export of goldfinches has been going on to such an extent that a goldfinch now sells at over ten times the price at which it sold a dozen years ago. I hope the House will give sympathetic consideration to this Bill. If there are matters which could be amended in the Bill to the public advantage, I hope the amendments will be made.  But I do hope that the House will not repeat its action of a few years ago and refuse to give favourable consideration to a measure which the mass of humanity favours.</P>

      <P>With the general principles of the Bill, I am in agreement. I do not think it is right to compare the bird with the goat. The bird is a helpless, timid thing, and in all nations it has been the emblem or symbol of freedom.  One cannot look on the tethering of it as one would look on the tethering of a semi-tame or domestic goat.  Certain amendments may later be brought in to prevent people being driven out of employment, but I do not think it is fair that one should live on cruelty.  If that were to be so, a case could be made for China or any other country in which you had official torturers.  It could be said that if you did away with torture you would do away with the livelihood of certain people.  I think the keeping of birds in these small cages is a disgrace to freedom.  I have seen a number of birds, as Deputy Rice mentioned, cooped up in a cage which was not sufficient to hold one. Personally I would open every birdcage in the country, even in the zoo, and release every bird except the canary, which could not live if it were liberated.</P>

      <P>There are portions of <Col N="90" /> this Bill with which I agree, and there are other portions with which I do not agree.  I agree with the protection of birds during the months of March, April, May, June, July and August.  But I do not think it is right to make fish of a certain class of young men and flesh of another class.  There is more cruelty in going out, shooting a pheasant and leaving it wounded and dying, than in putting bird-lime on a piece of a stake and capturing a bird. When I was a young fellow, I went out bird-catching with others.  When releasing the hen birds, we always took very good care to clean them and to put them in such a condition that when they alighted on a tree they would not stick to it.  We had an interest in the birds.  We did not go out to torture them.  We brought the birds we caught home.  There are a good many young men who go out bird-catching for sport.  I never sold a bird in my life.  A lot of young men deem it a recreation to go out bird-catching on Sundays. I agree that it is a very good thing to protect thrushes and blackbirds and the other birds whose nests would be robbed in the months I have mentioned.  But there are a great many men who would be lonesome if they had not a thrush in the house.  How are they going to get a thrush except they rob a nest and rear one?  The man I have referred to is not going to be cruel to his thrush.  I think the thrush is the most respected individual in the house.  I heard the Minister for Justice say the farmers would be allowed to shoot pests, such as crows and magpies.  I do not know whether or not he included the jackdaw.  The jackdaw is a pest in the towns.  The jackdaw will go down a chimney, build his nest, and the next time you light your fire you will be smothered. I think we should be allowed to shoot him or gas him.</P>

Why should not they export the birds to England or elsewhere when we import canaries?  I will take a few minutes more to consider how I will vote, but I think the Minister should bring in a few amendments which would save the whole situation.</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill the Minister stated that he was prepared to accept certain amendments. I fear that the amendments that will be acceptable to the Minister will not affect those against whom this Bill is actually directed. To begin with, the Bill is entitled &ldquo;The Wild Birds Protection Bill,&rdquo; and right away we become as inconsistent as we possibly can.  We immediately define certain birds as wild and say that they may be killed, whilst stating that other wild birds shall not be killed.  It would be a very good thing if we could live in the age to which Deputy Fahy referred when everything would be as we would like to have it.  Deputy Fahy mentioned the age of torturers. We still have the age of torturers with us.  If we are really going to try to set a headline in legislation from a humane point of view let us be humane and let us protect all wild birds, whether they are caught and kept in cages, whether they are destroyed by bird-lime, or whether they are shot by the gun of the sportsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the person against whom this Bill is directly aimed is the person who has the greatest interest in the preservation of the very birds that this Bill covers.  The bird-catchers are rather uneasy at the moment, because if this Bill goes through in its present form they will lose their means of livelihood.  If they were permitted to continue catching birds I say that they would be the last to destroy in their entirety the birds out of which they make a living.  It is to their own <Col N="92" /> interest to see that these birds continue in existence so that they can catch a certain number of them and sell them as a means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting held in the Mansion House for the purpose of getting support for this Bill, and I listened very attentively to the case put forward by the various speakers. I also met a deputation of bird-catchers&mdash;I understand that there are over three hundred of these in the Free State&mdash;and they gave me their side of the story.  They were prepared to prove that what is referred to as cruelty in this Bill is in fact not cruelty, but of course they are poor people, they are the underdogs, and I do not suppose that a deputation from them would be received to enable them to put their case.  They could not hire the Mansion House.  I believe they are having a meeting to-morrow night in some back street, which is the limit of their resources.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Section 4 will have to be substantially amended and that so will Section 6, in the sense that some specification at least should be provided.  The Bill says that a cage must be of &ldquo;such a size,&rdquo; but the size is not specified.  It should be stated that the cage should measure so many inches; otherwise if a man has a cage of a certain size anybody can say that it is not big enough.  Let us specify the size of the cage.  These men to whom I have referred are very anxious to facilitate us.  As a matter of fact, I understand that the people who make bird cages would be better pleased if larger cages were specified because they would get more money for them. The same applies to cages in which birds are sent from one place to another when there is more than one bird in each cage.  I have a letter&mdash; I presume every other Deputy has also got one&mdash;from the Dublin Conservators of Fisheries, who are making a noise because the heron is included in this Bill.  They say that it should be destroyed because it kills the salmon and trout.  That is how humane we are; we are only humane in a figure of speech.  The whole world at present lives in opposition <Col N="93" /> to everything that is humane.  If we were to be really humane we would not rear cattle for the purpose of killing and cating them; but these are the conditions we live under.  Let us at least be consistent and not live a kind of high-class hypocrisy.  I have just as much love for a heron as for a bullfinch from the point of view that both are wild birds.  The heron is not responsible for its nature because it has to live on fish; the bullfinch is not responsible for its nature because it has to live on thistle seeds.</P>
    <P>If we are going to protect wild birds let us protect them entirely, not only from the bird-lime of the poor man who makes his living catching them, but also from the gun of the sportsman.  Pheasants are specially reared for the purpose of one week's shoot, when they are shot as fast as they can be let out, so that only an odd one escapes.  The Minister may laugh at that, but pheasants are bred for the purpose of being shot.</P>

      <P>Not being a sportsman, I will probably be excused for not knowing the exact sporting term, but they are kept in captivity in coverts, and then they are released when all the gentlemen are lined up with their guns to bang away at them.  That is humanity!.  But if a poor man goes out to catch a few birds to sell to people who will care for them and feed them daily, and with whom they will live as long as eight or ten years, that is against the interests of humanity and it must be stopped.  If I had any hope that the amendments that will be accepted would affect the interests of these people who make a living by catching birds, I would support the Bill as it is, because it goes a certain distance in the direction of protecting wild life, from a humane point of view; but I am satisfied that the amendments that will be accepted will be either to lengthen or to shorten the close season, so <Col N="94" /> that birds will be protected for shooting.  I have met bird catchers, and I have heard birds sing at their request, a thing I did not believe was possible.  I am satisfied that they treat birds in captivity with a great deal more humanity than a number of the great lords and the gentry who go round to big shoots and shoot thousands and thousands of wild birds for the love of destruction and for no other reason, not even with the excuse of making a living out of it.</P>

      <P>I am very much in favour of this Bill, and I sincerely hope that the House will pass its Second Reading.  I went to a public meeting at the Mansion House and spoke there in favour of the Bill, but I criticised it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My chief criticism was in respect of some of the birds that are included in the First Schedule.  At my own home I have a sanctuary for wild birds, especially wild duck.  That shows that I love wild birds and that I want to try to protect them.  The sanctuary has been in existence about forty-five years.  It was started by my great-uncle, and it might amuse the House if I told how it was started.  The duck used to come there in the winter, but not very many of them, and my great-uncle was very anxious to start a sanctuary there.  One winter when the lake was frozen some oats were soaked in whiskey and scattered on it.  The birds ate the oats, fluttered about, were caught, and their wings were cut.  That was the start of the sanctuary.  Now in the winter time there are hundreds of wild duck there.  They know they are perfectly safe and that no one will ever disturb them.  I also have a heronry. In the lake there were trout, and I put in a number of golden carp.  I am afraid that I have not looked after the herons properly, but have let them increase too much, and the consequence is that the trout and the golden carp have gone.  If I had wisely restricted these herons, shot them judiciously and kept them down I should still have the trout and the golden carp.  I wonder how <Col N="95" /> much damage I have done around my own district to valuable fisheries, and after all the fishing industry in this country is a very valuable asset and I hold it will increase in value every year.  We must be wise in having restrictions to keep down birds which destroy a valuable asset of that nature.  There is no doubt that herons do untold damage and that they must be kept within check. That is one reason why I would like to see the heron taken out of the First Schedule.  We must face up to the facts.</P>
    <P>Now I want to refer only to one or two birds mentioned in the First Schedule.  Some of us may be perfectly agreeable to giving up a certain proportion of our own fruit for them to eat so that we may enjoy their song; but what we have to ask ourselves is: Have we the right to stop people from preserving their fruit who are probably dependent on it in order to balance their family exchequers? That is a point we have to face up to and a point which we have to decide.</P>
    <P>Taking it on the whole, I think this is an excellent Bill.  I think it would be a terrible thing if bird-lime provision were omitted.  To my mind, that is one of the cruellest things that could be used.  I do not say that in some cases it is not used carefully and that no harm is done, but there are hundreds of cases where it is used carelessly, and the birds that are not caught but get away with the bird-lime on their feet die of starvation.  They leave the bird-lime in other places and they may flutter off themselves, but other birds are caught.  It is the other birds you want to protect&mdash; those which get caught and die of starvation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not see any great advantage in this Bill. The Minister says the object of the Bill is to prevent cruelty to wild birds.  If cruelty is practised.  I am of opinion that there are sufficient laws at present in existence to prevent it and to punish culprits.  I <Col N="96" /> also consider that the House would be better engaged if it were dealing with some other Bill on this, the first day after the holidays, more especially when there is so much to be done and so many Bills to be dealt with between now and the summer.</P>
      <P>I would not have intervened were it not for the fact that no other Deputy seemed to touch on the penalties that are to be inflicted on the alleged evil-doer.  Section 4 has been referred to by Deputy White. He is a medical man and ought to know something about cruelty.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>(b)  use as a decoy any live bird which is tethered or is secured by means of braces or other similar appliances or which is blind, maimed or injured, or</P>
      <P>(c)  use bird-lime or any substance of a like nature for the purpose of taking or capturing alive or attempting to take or capture alive any wild bird, or</P>
      <P>(d)  take or attempt to take any wild bird by means of a hook or other similar instrument,</P>
      <P>shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding twenty-five pounds or alternately or in addition thereto to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a young fellow is out for sport and uses bird-lime to catch a bird, if he is brought up will he not do his utmost to defeat justice in such a case?  Do you think he would hesitate even at perjury in order to try to get out of a penalty of £25 or three months in jail?  The section says &ldquo;not exceeding,&rdquo; but we have some Justices administering justice who sometimes inflict the full penalty that the law allows.  Is it not a greater crime on the part of the State to be responsible for encouraging a youth or a man who is trying to make a living to commit perjury? My attention would not have been drawn so much to that but for the fact that recently a district justice <Col N="97" /> inflicted the full penalty in a case where the offence was not really a breach of the law.  A petition was got up and I was responsible for sending it to the Minister for Justice. I sympathise with the Minister for having to deal with such a case because it was a question of reducing the fine which, of course, is a bad precedent for future cases.  I drew the Minister's attention to the petition and I warned him that if the full penalty was inflicted and if there was not some mitigation I would not support any Bill with such extreme penalties in future. There is as penal a clause in this Bill as was ever inflicted by any Act.  It is like hanging a man for stealing a sheep, and I will not support the Bill while that section is in it.  That is my chief reason for opposing the Bill, and I am as humane a person as there is in this House, but I put humanity before perjury, and this Bill encourages youths or persons trying to make a living out of birds to perjure themselves.</P>
    <P>After all, people cannot be expected to know the law from A to Z in one or two years after centuries of tyranny and slavery.  Only recently we had an instance of where an extreme penalty was inflicted in a trifling case.  I will not go further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, this type of legislation is very unhealthy, I think. We have a series of Bills dealing with matters of importance, and this is a very secondary matter compared with the legislation we should be dealing with.  It reflects very badly on the Government that they should be devoting time required for much more important problems, such as unemployment and matters affecting the economic condition of the people, to this sort of Bill.  That has been mentioned already, and I do not want to dwell on it.  I would like to impress on the Minister two points that have been made already. Surely he does not want to make criminals.  He will if he is going to allow heavy penalties of this sort to be put on thoughtless boys who use <Col N="98" /> bird-lime, and who may incur a penalty of three months' imprisonment. Once a boy has spent three months in prison he is on the road to be a criminal and is put into a class in which he will be turned into a criminal, so that instead of catching birds he will wind up by being a hardened criminal.  That is, after all, the educational process of making a criminal.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister should take into very careful consideration the type of penalties that can be imposed and change them very radically. There are these 300 poor people who are going to be thrown out of employment. They are not of a very cruel type.  At any rate, they serve a very good purpose.  To people who live in big cities and who happen to walk through the poorer streets and hear a bird singing in the slums, it serves a certain purpose.  These people have not the opportunities of people like Deputy Wolfe or Deputy O'Mahony of having large estates around them, and the only possibility they have of getting in touch with nature is by listening to a bird singing in a cage.  That is another side of the question.  These people who supply a certain human need in the big cities, I think, deserve some sort of consideration if they are going to be deprived of their means of livelihood.  We have excellent precedents for saying that they should receive some sort of compensation. We have able-bodied judges walking about the streets with nothing to do, living on large pensions, because they have been deprived of their means of livelihood. I think if certain people are compensated in an extravagant way, having been deprived of their means of livelihood, at least some small compensation should be given to these poor people who live upon the proceeds of bird catching.</P>

      <P>As one who opposed a similar Bill some years ago, I also intend to oppose this Bill.  Although the Bill has been introduced by the Minister, I have heard no argument in its favour.  The Minister himself <Col N="99" /> did not seem to favour the Bill very much.  Deputy Rice and Deputy O'Mahony were the only persons who really supported the Bill.  Senators of all parties have plenty of scope for bringing in much more important Bills than this.  They have been silent as to the conditions prevailing throughout the country. Deputy Rice referred to the conditions under which birds were kept in cages.  Deputy Fahy supported Deputy Rice.  Deputy Rice, as a legal gentleman, should know that there is a law to prevent cruelty to animals.  When fighting a bye-election, Deputy Rice promised those people in Dublin who are living nine or ten in a small room that by elecing him to the Dáil they would help to solve the housing problem.  We know what has happened since.  He has asked the Dáil not to reject this Bill, like the former one.  I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill.  There are over 100 men in my constituency who have formed themselves into an association, and I can say that they are the best friends and protectors that the birds have.  They are men who protect the birds in the close season.  If a female bird happens to be caught on the bird-lime these men will not throw it away, but bring it home and clean it and let it out again.  These are the men who will feed the birds in times of storm or when there is snow on the ground, not like those who have lip sympathy for them in the Seanad and other places.  These are the men who educate their children in the love of birds and to place food and water outside for them.  How many of the people that we see attending meetings for the protection of birds have even sympathy for human beings, much less for birds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to reject the Bill as there is very much more useful work to be done than discussing this question.  The poor man has been deprived of the right to catch rabbits with a dog on Sunday.  The only sport that the poor man has now on a Sunday is to catch birds, and that right is being taken from him under this Bill.  We hear a lot of talk about <Col N="100" /> liberty.  There will be no liberty soon in this country, but the liberty to die of hunger.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Rice referring to the sympathy he has for the poor birds. On a previous occasion here the Deputy voted to give the right to people in this country to shoot birds and to allow retrievers to bring wounded birds back to their master.  The Deputy had no sympathy on that occasion for the poor birds.  It was a question then of legislating for the rich.  When it comes to the poor man, we have Deputy Rice supporting this Bill which comes from the Senate.  Labour Senators would have been better employed trying to do something for the poor people of the country instead of supporting such a Bill as this.</P>

      <P>I would not be opposed to this Bill, but I realise that if it goes through as it stands it will have the effect of depriving a considerable number of the men referred to by Deputy Everett not alone of amusement, but of a means of livelihood, or a means at least of supplementing their very meagre income. I also know quite a number of men who eke out a very meagre income by the capture of wild birds.  These men are not cruel to the birds.  It is to their interest not to be.  Of course that does not apply in every case.  You will find sportsmen wounding a bird with a gun and leaving that bird there to die.  You will find a bird catcher who is careless or indifferent as to the  a bird which gets off the bird-lime. But all men are not of that kind.  A lot of this talk about cruelty to birds in cages has no foundation in fact. I have seen birds when let out of cages come back to them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the size of cages.  I wonder is it realised that many wild birds if put into too large a cage will kill themselves in the cage, and that for the bird's own safety they have to be kept in a very small cage for some time.  Men who are in the habit of catching <Col N="101" /> birds are well aware of that and if they do keep a bird in a small cage it is because if it were put into a larger cage it would destroy itself. Then as to bird-lime, there are different forms of it.  If the proper kind is used it has not at all as bad an effect as the other kind.  Bird-lime made from holly bark is not at all as injurious to birds as the bird-lime imported from England which, I believe, is manufactured out of Stockholm tar and other ingredients. The experts only use the former kind.  They are very careful when freeing a bird to see that it is free from bird-lime.  Of course there are some who will not do this.  There have been cases where birds have been found dead from the effects of bird-lime, but these cases should not be taken as an indication that all men act in this way and are indifferent to the fate of the bird.  It is certainly right to make the use of hooks for the catching of birds illegal.</P>
    <P>I notice no reference is made to nets.  One man with a net would catch more goldfinches in one haul than a man who uses bird-lime would get in a week.  I have known an Englishman in this country who, in one net, captured thirty goldfinches. As to licences for the export of birds, I notice that under Section 9 there is an absolute prohibition as to the export of wild birds.  That should be amended.  There should be some licence for the export of live birds because a man who makes a living by the capture of wild birds will find that if the birds cannot be exported his living is gone.  If that were amended, and if the export of wild birds was allowed under licence, it might meet the case.  Then with regard to Section 11 as to the penalty for refusing to give name and place of abode, there is a danger that it might give rise to breaches of the peace.  If every busybody is allowed to walk up to a man and ask his name and address, it may be found very often that such a person would not get a very civil answer.  No individual should get the right to go that far.  That is a matter which <Col N="102" /> should be confined to servants of the State.</P>

      <P>In my part of the country there are a lot of bird fanciers and I have been associated with those people for years.  I have never seen them harm any birds.  I have often been out with these men catching finches and never saw any harm done.  I should like to know from the Minister whether the local authority has any powers in enforcing the Act.  Will it have to be adopted by the county council before it is put in force?  Is it to be left to the local authorities to strike a rate because the local authority has to strike a rate to carry out the duties involved?  If the Bill passes this House, it rests with the county councils to enforce it as I understand it.</P>

      <P>Just before I deal with the various points made, I should like to deal with one remark made by Deputy Little to the effect that a Bill of this nature is not a very pressing Bill and therefore should not be considered.  Deputy Little seems to forget that the Bill is not one introduced by the Government at all.  It is a Bill that has passed the Seanad and has come down from the Seanad to this House and the question is should this House consider a Bill that has been passed by the Seanad or not?  Personally, I am of opinion that if the Seanad passes a Bill and sends it on to the Dáil, then we must certainly consider that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very curious that Deputy Little complains of the waste of time, but he was careful to say that he was not going to make any new points, and was going only to repeat what other Deputies had said.  If that is not rather defeating his own argument I do not know what is.  I should like to point out to Deputy Lemass that this Bill does not destroy bird-catching at all.  This Bill allows a certain amount of bird-catching, but it prohibits certain methods, and only certain methods, of catching birds, which methods, in the opinion of a great many people, are cruel.  I <Col N="103" /> think that the cruel method of bird-lime should not be used when other methods could be used instead.  I might again point out to Deputy Lemass, as the last speaker has said, that nets are much more effective for catching birds than bird-lime, but netting is not prohibited by this Bill. I would also point out that not all wild birds, but only those whose names are set out in the second schedule cannot be exported from this country.  Deputy Briscoe talked a great deal about logic, and went on to say that because you stop the destruction of one kind of wild bird you should stop the destruction of all kinds of wild birds.  That is to say, you should stop the destruction of harmful birds as well as harmless birds; both should be equally protected or none should be protected. I must frankly confess that that is not an argument that I can follow at all.  There are birds that I know that do a great deal of harm. The magpie is one.  The woodpigeon is another.  The woodpigeon does an enormous amount of harm to agriculture. More grain is consumed by one woodpigeon than any other class of bird, and more damage is done by one woodpigeon to cabbage plants in the spring than would be done by a thousand bullfinches.</P>
    <P>There are certain classes of birds that are really pests and should not be protected and are not protected by this Bill.  The landowner can shoot them or the farmer can shoot them or they can authorise other persons to shoot them at different seasons of the year.  That seems to me to be quite right.  As far as the other points of criticism passed on the Bill go, they were really what I would call Committee Stage points; for example, the fine that should be imposed and the maximum fine that should be fixed in the section.  Deputy Carey asked whether the county councils were to have any power under this Bill.  They will have.  The birds under this Bill can be varied by the Minister for Justice upon the report he gets from the county councils, that is, under subsection <Col N="104" /> (2) of Section 2.  Dealing with the points Deputy Anthony made at considerable length about bird sanctuaries, I would like to see several bird sanctuaries established in the neighbourhood of towns. There are certain places in the neighbourhood of Dublin that might be turned into excellent bird sanctuaries. They would be safe there and the birds could be seen by people who take an interest in country life and who cannot spend their whole time nor as much of it as they would like in the country or in country places.</P>
    <P>The speech that appealed to me most on Second Reading was the speech made by Deputy Fahy.  I rather feel with Deputy Fahy when he says that wild birds in cages seem to be in the wrong place.  I agree with him that that appears nowhere more painfully than in the Zoological Gardens.  I think the bulk of the points made are points that can be dealt with in Committee.  No doubt in Committee we will have strong expressions of opinion on one side or the other and it will be entirely a matter for the House to decide.  This is not a Government measure, it is a measure upon which the House will vote just as it thinks right, but I commend the Bill to the House for Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Bill is intended to provide for the better control and management of workhouse lands and buildings formerly vested in the Local Government Board and held by it for the purposes of the Poor Relief Acts.  Clause XI of the Constitution secured that State lands could not be alienated, and that they would have to be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas.  The State Lands Act of 1924 laid down <Col N="105" /> the procedure for the regulation and control of these lands.  For a time it was not clear that workhouses were State lands within the meaning of that clause in the Constitution and within the meaning of the State Lands Act.  It was subsequently decided that they did come under that clause of the Constitution and under the State Lands Act of 1924.  The procedure, as the result of that, has been that the workhouses are vested in the State. The letting and the renting of them is controlled by the Minister for Finance and the proceeds of the lettings are brought into the Central Fund.  A rather elaborate procedure dealing with lettings was introduced. While taking the control of these lands and their rents into the Central Fund, the responsibility for maintaining these lands and other property still rested on the local body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that the workhouses will be taken from under the operation of the State Lands Act, that the Minister for Local Government, who has administrative responsibility for administering the Poor Relief Acts, will take the position of the Minister for Finance in the State Lands Acts, and that the lettings of land and property in future will be on the following lines: it will still be impossible to alienate these lands, or to grant a lease or a licence to anyone for their occupation for more than 99 years. Proposals to lease or to let these lands for a period of more than five years will be tabled in the same way as such proposals have been tabled up to the present, but it is proposed that the Minister for Local Government be given powers to make regulations under which the local body, in whose functional area the workhouse is, can grant a lease or a licence for a less period than five years at a rent and subject to conditions that will be in accordance with regulations made by the Minister and subject to his consent.  The Minister for Local Government will be given power as well to make regulations under which lettings for a shorter period than twelve months <Col N="106" /> can be made by the local body without reference to him at all.  A large number of small lettings of lands for plots and other purposes are made annually.  The present machinery is too complicated very often, so that the period of a letting has expired before the Department is in full possession of the particulars which, according to the State Lands Act, ought to be laid before the Oireachtas before the letting becomes effective.</P>
    <P>Moneys to the extent of about £1,100 have already been paid into the Central Fund as a result of these lettings.  It is proposed that these moneys will be returned to the Minister for Local Government.  It is also proposed that the annual lettings, which at the present moment amount to about £707, be handed over to the Minister for Local Government, and that these moneys will be used for suitable purposes in connection with poor relief in the functional area of the authority from which these moneys come.  Generally the purposes of the Bill is to simplify the procedure for dealing with these lands.  The local authority was responsible for the upkeep of workhouses formerly.  As a result of the passage of the State Lands Act there has been a doubt in certain cases whether the local authority was responsible for the upkeep of workhouse buildings or not, and in many cases a certain amount of serious neglect has taken place. The Bill proposes to make it the duty of the local authority to keep and maintain in good tenantable order and repair the buildings that are involved in the matter.  The State Lands Act was passed in August, 1924.  Previous to that, in August, 1923, an agreement for the making of a lease was entered into by the Minister for Local Government with Messrs.  Watt and Co. with respect to certain parts of the workhouse in Letterkenny.  There was no statutory authority at the time to do that, but that was not then understood. This Bill proposes to make valid and good the agreement for a lease then entered into and to authorise the Minister for Local Government to <Col N="107" /> enter into the leasing for twentyfive years as from August, 1923, at a rent of £100 to Messrs. Watt.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to oppose the main principle of this Bill, but I would like to draw the attention of the House to a very important issue which is raised by the measure in an incidental manner.  I refer to the proposal which the Bill contains for the allocation of the State revenue which will arise from these lands.  This Bill proposes to allocate to the Department of Local Government certain functions of this House which nobody, I think, ever proposed to interfere with before.  I do not know if the Minister for Local Government has read a book entitled &ldquo;The New Despotism,&rdquo; by the Lord Chief Justice of England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did so it was probably in the same spirit that the criminal reads detective novels&mdash;that is, for the purpose of getting useful hints.  He certainly is proposing in this Bill to infringe on the powers of this House to an extent greater than anything attempted heretofore. This Bill may conform to the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution, but I think it interferes to a great extent with the principle of Article 61 of the Constitution, which provides that all revenues of the State from every source shall be paid into one fund, and shall be paid out of that fund only in accordance with the manner decided on by this House.  The revenue accruing to the State from the leasing of these State lands has heretofore been paid into the Central Fund.  It is proposed to cease that practice if this Bill becomes law, and to provide that this revenue shall be paid to the Minister for Local Government, who shall be entitled to apply that money for such purposes within the functional area of the local authority in whose functional area the land the subject of such lease or licence is situated as he shall think advisable. <Col N="108" /> That is a very new and, in my opinion, a very undesirable principle. The Minister has told us it is his intention to use the money for the purpose of poor relief.  We are glad to know that that is his intention. It is not, however, so stated in the Bill.  In any case, it is an old proverb that hard cases make bad laws.  The mere fact that the money is going to be put to a good purpose should not induce us to give assent to a very dangerous principle.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to interfere with the Dáil's absolute control over finance.  The Dáil, I think, should resist this infringement of its powers at this stage before the Government goes any further in that manner. The spirit of bureaucracy is developing in the Executive Council.  We have had numerous examples of it in recent measures introduced here, but this is, I think, the first time in which they have come to the point of taking from the Dáil the absolute control over finance which we have exercised up to this.  It does not seem impossible to devise machinery which will enable the Minister to do everything which he may wish to do following the passage of this Bill, while at the same time preserving the right of this House.  Why cannot the money accruing from the leasing of these lands be paid into the Central Fund and thus made subject to the survey of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the authority of this House?  I cannot understand what purpose it is intended to serve by inserting this provision in the Bill, unless I am correct in assuming that the Ministry hope to establish a precedent which can be used in more important measures later.  I would like if the Minister would deal with that specific point in replying, because it raises a matter of very grave importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section of this Bill which raises a somewhat similar issue.  That is Section 4.  The ostensible purpose of that section is to preserve the authority of the Dáil over the leasing of these lands.  Any person who read the Bill casually or <Col N="109" /> accepted the definition of it which appears upon the margin would be inclined to believe that that section was inserted to ensure that the Dáil would have the right of veto over any proposed lease or to amend that lease; that section is, I think, identical in every respect with a similar section which appeared in the State Lands Act of 1924.  Deputies will recollect that last year Deputy Hogan attempted to operate the machinery provided in the State Lands Act of 1924 with respect to the leasing of lands attached to the Scariff Workhouse in County Clare and failed to do so because the machinery was defective.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would tell us why the power of the Dáil over these leases cannot be made positive instead of negative?  In other words, why cannot it be enacted that these proposed leases will not become effective until the Oireachtas has given positive assent to them?  The Bill as it now stands merely provides that a Deputy can, during twelve sitting days following the laying of the papers relating to the lease upon the Table of the House, introduce a motion to amend it or to express objection to it.  There is, however, no provision in the Bill to ensure that a motion of that kind must be considered by the House within the period specified.  From one example of the working of the machinery which we had last year, we know that the safeguard there provided is absolutely useless unless it is also provided that the motion moved to amend the proposal is given priority over all other business during the period provided.  In my opinion, the best course to take is to ensure that the Dáil will have positive power; in other words, that no lease will become effective until the Minister has brought a motion to the House expressing positive approval of it.  In 99 cases out of 100 that would be a mere formal motion introduced in the usual way of public business and would occupy only a couple of minutes.  It is only in the 100th case where a Deputy would have definite objection to the proposal <Col N="110" /> that a debate would ensue.  If that course is adopted, the power of the Dáil to interfere directly with the administration of this Bill will be preserved and I think the members of the Dáil irrespective of party should be anxious to preserve the power of the Dáil.  This is not a party question.  The Government now in office will not be always in office.  The Deputies now supporting the Government may be in Opposition some time in the future when they may find their powers interfered with or curtailed in respect of these matters unless they interfere now to preserve this power.  This is a question in which the ordinary Deputies will find themselves in opposition to the members of the Executive Council who naturally believe that they are the best fitted to regulate affairs and will endeavour to secure that power to themselves. While, however, we have, in theory, a democratic Government in office, we should endeavour to ensure that the forms of democracy will be preserved. We have here an opportunity of doing so and I would ask the Deputies to insist when this Bill comes before them in Committee that the necessary alterations are made in Sections 3 and 4 so as to ensure that no future dangers will arise from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I do not propose to go very deeply into this matter, but in some respects I differ in my view of it from the view expressed by Deputy Lemass.  He suggests that the Dáil should have control over the revenue obtained by leasing or letting these buildings.  I have another point of view.  I think that the party that has charge of the responsibility of maintaining these buildings, the authority that cared for these buildings when they were going concerns, should be the authority to whom the revenue and control of these lands and buildings should continue.  I suggest to the Minister that when workhouses were used more generally than they are now under the amalgamation scheme, the local authorities were charged with their care and preservation <Col N="111" /> in a habitable condition.  At that time, the local authorities had large responsibilities for the care of these buildings, and I think the Minister will agree that these responsibilities were in the main well discharged.  I suggest to the Minister now that those local bodies within these functional areas should have control.  The Minister may suggest to me that the district councils have disappeared and that the boards of guardians have disappeared in various districts.  But we have still the county councils and boards of health and they will be capable of seeing that these institutions are properly looked after.</P>
      <P>I see the Minister proposes that the local authorities should act as collectors of this money, and I also see that the Minister proposes that the local authorities should maintain these buildings in a habitable condition. Yet, while he proposes they should look after them, he does not propose that they should have any say in the leasing or letting of them. Of course, in the ordinary course, the Minister would have the right of sanction or disapproval of what these local bodies would do.  I think, however, considering the entire position, that the local people would have a better knowledge of what it would be proper to use those buildings for and the proper method of dealing with them.  When I saw the Bill, I thought the Minister had relented in the matter of the State Lands Act of 1924 and that so far as the State lands were concerned he was going to change the whole position in this Bill.  The Minister is evidently going to stereotype the position and make it worse than it has been, if that be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some places a number of these buildings were destroyed at one time or another and grants have been given by way of compensation, but there are some doubts as to what became of the compensation that was paid.  These buildings were destroyed as an act of military necessity and one would expect that there would be something in this Bill dealing with that.  It is obvious from <Col N="112" /> what Deputy Lemass has said that unless some new machinery is introduced or the present machinery altered, the laying on the Table of the Dáil of leases or lettings of this property will be of no value in the way of preserving the rights of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any machinery has been introduced that will make these matters purely Government matters and that will ensure that Government time is given for their consideration.  One may be obliged to put down a motion at the end of a long litany of motions, and it may not be reached for months. I do not know whether that comes within the province of the Minister or somebody else, but I do suggest that it should come within the provence of somebody and it should be attended to.  I do not agree that the letting or leasing of these plots should be in the hands of the Local Government Department.  They should be left to the local authorities, who are the proper authorities in the matter of leasing or letting, because they are conversant with the position in the district.  The local authorities have full knowledge as to the proper use that should be made of these lands.  That is the proper way in which to administer this Bill, and not by any other means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Hogan in his contention that local persons should be the persons to receive the revenue from the letting of lands, if they are to be the persons liable for the repairs to the workhouses.  If I have read Sections 10 and 11 correctly, they mean that the local authorities will have to keep these buildings in order. Since the amalgamation nothing has been done with some of these buildings, and it would take anything from £500 to £2,000 to put them in order.  I have in mind Delvin workhouse. Part of it was destroyed during the troubled times and the rest of it has been left derelict since.  To put it in repair it would mean at least one penny in the £ on the ratepayers, and to keep it in repair would mean some hundreds annually, <Col N="113" /> maybe £100 or £200.  If this Bill is passed, and if that responsibility is put on the local authority, the Westmeath County Council, that Council should be made responsible for receiving the revenue, and it would know best how to get the biggest price for the letting of lands and buildings there.</P>
      <P>We have been endeavouring for the past year or two to let portion of Delvin Workhouse in the way of flats to some families, and we have been in communication with the Minister's Department for a long period without any result.  That means a big loss of revenue.  If the Department is as slow in other matters as in the instance I have given, then I must say that they would not be as quick in getting revenue as would the Westmeath County Council. I think it would be undemocratic in every sense of the word if the receipt and the application of revenue were taken out of the hands of the local authorities.  I think the first charge against that revenue would be the maintenance of the buildings and land, meaning by the maintenance of land proper fencing and upkeep.  I am not very clear on the whole Bill, but perhaps I will be in Committee.  As I have read the Bill, there seems to me to be much room for improvement.  I support Deputy Hogan in his contention that the local authorities should be made responsible for the receipt of revenue and that the revenue should be devoted primarily towards the maintenance of lands and the repair of buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is one of the most ridiculous proposals the Minister has ever introduced.  From my experience as a member of a board of health, caretakers in charge of those derelict workhouses and hospitals are paid out of the local rates. The Minister suggests that the revenues shall be handed to him to be used in any manner that he thinks fit.  From our experience of the manner in which the Minister thinks fit to use revenue he is scarcely a trustworthy person, and I do not think that he should be allowed to receive <Col N="114" /> any revenue.  He suggests that the money should be paid to him and that it will be applied by him as he shall think advisable in the functional area of the local authority.  I do not think that will appeal to any local authority, no matter what county it is in.  The Minister's attitude to local bodies is well known, but his attitude in particular towards the funds of local bodies is anything but desirable.</P>
      <P>It is a scandalous state of affairs that any responsible Minister here should suggest that the ratepayers, who have loads enough on their shoulders, should pay caretakers to keep these buildings in repair and at the same time should not be allowed to retain the revenue.  I think the Minister would be well advised to withdraw this Bill altogether and bring in another Bill to hand over the workhouses and lands to the people who had to pay the rates in the first place for the building of them and who have had to maintain them for the last forty, fifty or sixty years.  The coolest proposition we have yet had from the Minister is that the revenues out of these places are to be handed over to him.  That is only what one would expect from the Minister, and it is only what persons in public positions, in Cork County at any rate&mdash;I do not care from what party they come&mdash;expect from him.</P>

      <P>The point I wanted to get at is how did these lands become State lands?  They were State lands when they were vested in the Local Government Board. They were not vested in the local authority and therefore they did not belong to the local authority.  If the Minister were to propose to give these lands to the local authority it would be reversing the procedure that had hitherto been adopted.  I take it that would be a correct statement. The lands heretofore belonged to the Government, whatever Government was in power, and there is no change in that ownership, so to speak, so far as this Bill is concerned. I find myself in considerable agreement with the points made by Deputy Hogan as to the right of the local authority to the revenue arising out of the leasing of these lands, if they are to have put upon them the charge of maintaining the lands. Section 10 refers to the liability of local authorities in respect of lands to which this Act will apply.  There will be a certain amount of outgoings for the upkeep of the lands, fencing them and doing other things of that sort.  Would it not be right and proper that at least such outgoings as are essential to keep the lands in proper condition should be allowed to the local authority?  It seems unfair that all the revenues should be centralised in the Local Government Department, with that Department, through its head, having full authority to dispose of the revenue.  I understand that the Minister says he will dispose of that money in the particular area for poor relief or something of that kind, but, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, that is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liability is put into the Bill and, while it is there, I think that there ought to be, as a quid pro quo, authority in the Bill to credit the <Col N="116" /> local authority with such amount of money as, in the opinion of the inspectors of the Department, is necessary to be expended annually to keep the lands under local control in proper order and condition.  The local authorities are, at least, entitled to that.  Somebody has said that the power to make leases is taken out of the hands of the local authorities.  I do not think that that is exactly correct.  Local authorities have power to make leases for a period less than five years.  In all probability there is not, I think, much change there as local authorities have not been in the habit of making leases for a period longer than five years.  That is so, at least, according to my limited knowledge of the matter.  I think it is unfair that local authorities should be bound under legal obligation to expend moneys for which they can get no return.</P>

So far as the control of local authorities goes, Section 5 proposes that the Minister shall have power to make regulations under which a local authority, acting as agent for him, can give a lease or licence for the use of land up to five years with the consent of the Minister and for less than one year without any reference to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes to the local authorities who devote it to the purposes indicated by the Minister. It could be made more explicit that that revenue will be devoted to the purposes of the Poor Relief Acts because there is no intention to divert <Col N="117" /> this property which must certainly be regarded, while vested in the Minister, as being vested for local purposes. There is no intention to divert it from such purposes nor is there any intention to divert the revenue from local application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan (Clare) Mr. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I want to be clear about this matter.  It is, of course, quite clear that local authorities have power to make certain leases, but I am not clear, and I do not know whether it is stated in the Bill, that the revenue is to come into the local authorities.  Further, I am anxious that if the revenue comes to a Central Department&mdash;I am not referring to the present Minister, as the Minister may be a Fianna Fáil, a Labour or an Independent Minister&mdash;the local authorities will know what the amount of that revenue is. I suggest that local authorities rather than a Central Department will be well able to satisfy the ratepayers as to what is being done with the revenue.  That is why I suggest that local authorities should administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities will know how much to expect in the case of leases for a period of five years.  The line of application in the case of leases for a longer period can be the local authority or the Minister, but there will be no desire to enter into such lease or licence without reference to the local authority.  It is simply for the purpose of bringing it more effectively under the system in the State Lands Act as contemplated by the Oireachtas that you make provision for fairly long leases, and you discriminate in the case of leases over five years by making the Minister the person who enters directly into the lease and by providing that he will be the collecting body, but he will be the collecting body for the amount of rent which the local body will be aware of and can expect to get annually.  It might be more explicitly put for the purposes of the Poor Relief Acts.  There is no conflict of opinion in regard to the control of the local authority in <Col N="118" /> the matter of giving a lease of a particular kind and in the matter of receiving revenue coming from buildings in their area.  So far as the application is concerned, it will be application for the purposes of the Poor Relief Acts.  In regard to the control of the Oireachtas, it was never contemplated in the State Lands Act that every lease that was entered into would be discussed by the Oireachtas.  Any Deputies who have read the discussions at local council meetings about the allotment of labourers' cottages would not ask that that kind of control would be exercised in that particular way here by the Oireachtas.  The Act of 1924, with the intention of shortening the period in this Act, arranges that a lease shall become operative when both Houses of the Oireachtas have passed a definite resolution.  That would only take place for a particular purpose, where there was a question of particular urgency and where the Minister desired to have a resolution passed to give effect to a lease.  The other method has the effect of informing the House by laying the facts on the Table.  It does not suggest that any Deputy who objects to Michael So-and-So getting a particular lease and getting it for £5 rather than for £10 should have facilities for raising and discussing such matters.</P>

I may have want of confidence in them in regard to certain matters, but my point was that a particular Minister was not utilising the ground in the best manner.

      <P>When the Minister says that the Government control the time of the House, he means, of course, that the Government control the time of the House which the Standing Orders allot to Government business, and that they may by special resolution control private members' time.  This matter of the discussion of a motion dealing with the annulling of an order made by a Minister, where the motion must be discussed within a certain period, was raised in May last at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, at the instance, I think, of Deputy Corish.  It may be within the recollection of Deputy Hogan as, I think, he himself raised a question about it.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges at that time recommended <Col N="120" /> that motions in regard to Orders, which, to be effective, had to be decided within a certain period, would be placed first amongst private members' business.  The Minister's point is the point which was then made by the President, that the Government would not itself give Government time.  At the present moment that is the arrangement that exists.  The Government does not give Government time for such motions, but precedence is given in private members' time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputies will consider what it would mean.  The instance which Deputy Hogan has referred to, the letting in the Scariff Workhouse, is one of a number of others.  If he considers that the case of the Scariff Workhouse might be duplicated in, say, 60, 70 or 80 other places round the country, I do not know that the Deputy would have sufficient time in the whole Dáil year to discuss the different lettings that Deputies might desire to discuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Government that that power should be exercised in a reasonable way, but the Deputy can read no more into this section than is in it, and I take it that he can appreciate that the Executive Council is not going, in ordinary cases where State lands require to be leased, in a small or trivial way, to give Government time for its discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of giving Government time.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can raise that matter, but I do not see that effective control of that particular property warrants it.  The Minister is generally answerable for his conduct in the House.  He is generally answerable for all his actions in connection with leases.  In regard to the other point raised by Deputy Lemass, that this is dealing with State lands in a way in which State lands have never been dealt with before, there is a very close analogy between these workhouses in that they serve, or were intended to serve, a particular public service and, say, labourers' cottages which are intended to serve a particular public service, or, say, the present county hospitals.  The present labourers' cottages are the property of the local body.  They are not vested in any Minister.  It was only a matter of arrangement originally, I take it, that these instead of being made the property of the local body were vested in a Government Department. If Deputy Lemass were to drive his argument to its ultimate conclusion, he would have to say that not only should moneys which come in for the rent of these lands or for the weekly tenancy of rooms in these buildings come into the Central Fund, but that the rents of labourers' cottages should also come into the Central Fund or that the fees received from patients occupying rooms or wards in the hospitals should come into the Central Fund.</P>

      <Col N="126" /> Even if you leave out these words &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; and put in the words &ldquo;parent, guardian or other person having the custody of such mother or child,&rdquo; there may be different persons, one having the custody of the mother and the other the custody of the child, so, therefore, I do not catch the Deputy's amendment.  I do not understand the person to whom it alludes.  Let us go on further.  The section would then read &ldquo;or on the application, within the time hereinafter limited, of a local body administering the relief of the poor then giving relief to the mother of an illegitimate child or to an illegitimate child, and in either case upon an information in writing upon oath being made by the mother of such child identifying the father of such child.&rdquo;  How on earth can the mother who is dead or the mother who is an idiot make an information?

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is actual knowledge of the facts?  The fact at issue is the parenthood of a child.  No one can have knowledge as to who is the parent of that child except the father and mother.  There might be the very rare case in which the putative father and mother had been seen consorting together.  That would not be by any means conclusive evidence of the parenthood of the child, because the mother may have consorted with other persons. It appears to me an injustice to the man charged.  No man should be convicted unless the woman who is the mother of the child, who brings the charge to his door, is there to swear that he is the father of the child.  There can be no certainty without the mother's evidence.  We must be careful in an Act of this nature, to see that there is no door left open for a man being saddled <Col N="127" /> with support who is not proved beyond all reasonable doubt to be the father, and that he should not be saddled with the support of a child which is not his child, or have his reputation blasted on evidence which may be very much mistaken.  Personally I do not think, in fairness to any person charged, a decree should be made against him unless the mother is in a position to come forward and swear who is the father of the child.  There may be cases in which the mother died in childbirth, or died some short time after childbirth, before she has made an information, or before the case is heard in court, and a happening of that nature may saddle the rates or some relative of the mother with the support of the child.  That is undoubtedly a case which may arise, but those would probably be not very many in number.  I think the principle that a man should be found guilty of being the father of the child without the evidence of the mother should not be permitted.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with almost everything the Minister has said, and I think if I had the opportunity I could take the remarks he made and piece them together to make my case better.  He says we should certainly not saddle anyone who is innocent or where there is insufficient evidence before the court with the stain of a crime of this kind or with the maintenance of a child, but I suggest a dying declaration on the part of the mother.</P>

      <P>There is a gap in the section and the Minister has admitted that there is one.  It may happen that a mother dies at childbirth, or may go out of her mind, before an opportunity arises to make a declaration.  It may happen in those cases that it is well known who was the father.  Even though the Minister denies that, I submit he is not taking the judicial view of the matter.  It is for a judge to decide that.  We cannot foresee what circumstances may arise.  To suggest that the amendment would treat people unfairly is to suggest that you have no confidence in your judiciary.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the general idea put forward in the Amendment.  The language to express it can be fixed up. I do not think it is right that a child who is deprived of its mother should be thrown on the rates because of that fact.  Proof is necessary in all cases, and, as Deputy Little pointed out, whether the mother is alive or otherwise the court will have to be satisfied very clearly and very definitely that the case is brought home to the father before he is saddled with the maintenance of the child.  In nine cases out of ten, it may be impossible to so satisfy the court in the absence of the mother.  I believe that will be the case.  In the tenth case the evidence may be perfectly clear, and there may have been admissions on the part of the father that can be testified to by others, apart from the mother.  There may be cases in which there is no doubt whatever in the mind of the court, even though the mother is not there to bear testimony to the fact, and I think provision should be made whereby the cost of maintenance of the child could be recovered from the putative <Col N="129" /> father.  As Deputy Little said, I think the section will leave a gap if some provision is not made for a child, where the mother has died before the application could be made. I think the principle of the amendment is good.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), line 44, to delete the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment suggested by me is to put in three months instead of twelve months, and the reasons are these: that in certain cases&mdash;not very numerous cases, I admit&mdash;having considered some literature on the subject and statements made by judges and others of vast experience. I think there is a slight possibility of blackmail; that a certain type of mother is inclined, in collusion with friends or others, to saddle a man, whom they consider to be a good mark, with the parentage of the <Col N="130" /> child.  There months is much more reasonable, and more likely to prevent such collusion or attempts at blackmail, than having twelve months in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve months is in the Bill.  If you say within three months of the birth of the child, the mother has less time for collusion with others, or to be inspired by friends with the possibility of blackmailing certain people, than she would have if given twelve months to think the matter over, or get others to think for her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for inserting twelve months was to give the mother reasonable time to take action.  There may be certain circumstances in which three months would be short.  The mother, for instance, might be out of the country at the time the child was born.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The mother may be out of the country at the time the child is born or may be seriously ill for some time afterwards, or there may be other circumstances which prevented her from going into court.  Really, I do not see that there is much more danger of blackmail at the end of twelve months than at the end of three months.  If after three months the mother is hale and hearty, that period is quite sufficient for her within which to make up her mind if she is going to blackmail.  At the same time, as far as the man is concerned, he has to defend his reputation, and it is easy for him to recollect where he was eighteen months ago.  For, instance, if a charge is brought against him on foot of something that happened twelve or eighteen months ago it is as easy for him to say at the end of eighteen months as it is at the end <Col N="131" /> of twelve months where he was then.  If the Deputy is very strong on the matter, possibly I would meet him by cutting the period down to six months.  I think six months would probably give the woman reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister would consider the point of making the period shorter in the case of a second or a repeated offender.  I think it would be advisable in the case of a repeated offender that the affiliation order would have to be sought, if possible, before the birth.  A good deal can be said in the case of a first offender in favour of waiting until after the birth.  I think, however, that most of the evidence of those who have an intimate knowledge of the psychology of these people has gone to show that the likelihood in the case of a first offender of the mother proceeding in court before the birth would be very small, for various obvious reasons.  I think these reasons do not exist in the case of the repeated offender.  There ought to be some distinction.  It does not appear to me to be right to provide for the possibility of a mother being successful in getting a number of affiliation orders.  I think it is a pity that the Minister did not include in the Bill some provision for the detention in some institution of this class of a mother who becomes a repeated offender and who really is a danger to the community.  However, I do not see that we can cover that particular point in this Bill.  I think it would require separate legislation.  I do think, however, that the Minister should take steps to make some differentiation between the first offender and the repeated offender.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2), page 3, a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the mother of such child was or became within the period prescribed by this Act for making such application an idiot or person of unsound mind, at any time within three months after such mother becomes of sound mind.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Minister would put a limit upon the number of years, and say that it would not be reasonable after a year or two years, or something of that sort, then you would give the woman a chance.

      <P>Deputy Ward will probably be able to give the Deputy more information than I could upon this point.  If it is a case of puerperal insanity, surely it would never last three months.  It is a thing which passes away quickly.  Other cases of insanity may last for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that it is unusual for puerperal insanity to last more than a few months.  It is, however, not so much a case of that kind Deputy Little has in mind, but the case of the unmarried mother, who, perhaps through the mental worry and stress that her condition has brought on her, becomes insane, and the birth takes place in a mental hospital.  I have personal knowledge of two such cases in the part of the country from which I come. I do not know how the Minister can protect such a mother, but I do feel very strongly that she is entitled to protection, inasmuch as her insanity has been brought about by the condition in which she finds herself. Nobody, of course, can conjecture how long she may remain insane, but it ought to be possible for the Minister to frame an amendment that would protect such a mother.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the motives which actuate Deputy Ward and others who have spoken, but the difficulty I see in carrying out the suggestion is that people against whom charges are to be made ought to have them made within a reasonable time.  This would permit a charge to be made after evidence has been destroyed and when people have no opportunity of proving a negative, and it might be made a serious instrument of oppression.  It may be that there will be individual cases of hardship, such as Deputy Ward referred to.  I quite accept his statement that such an individual case may happen, but you must balance the two evils one against the other, and I think you will have a greater evil if you allow a state of affairs to arise under the law in which charges may be made after a lengthened period of time when the persons charged are not in a position to produce evidence to disprove them.  For that reason, I do not agree with the suggestion made.</P>

      <P>You have just cut it down from twelve months now on the ground that it might lead to blackmail, and this seems to be quite illogical.  That is rather an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> which I do not wish to make use of.  But what is meant by a woman who has become insane?  That she is certified insane by two doctors or has become an idiot?  What does that proposal mean?</P>

I am prepared to accept the words, &ldquo;by reason of unsound mind,&rdquo; if the Minister prefers that.  The mere matter of words is not the question I am interested in, but whether the Minister will, in view of the fact that the time has been shortened, put in that the same period of six months which is to be given from the birth shall be given from the time when she becomes sane, but always within a period of, say, eighteen months from the birth.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where the mother of such child was not resident in Saorstát Eireann at the birth of the child, and the alleged father was domiciled in Saorstát Eireann within three months after her return to Saorstát Eireann and not later than twelve months after the birth of such child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is meant to deal with cases&mdash;there are a great many of them, as I am told by social workers, and people who know more about this than any other people in the country&mdash;in which the girl goes across to England, where the child is born.

There is the question of insanity, and going beyond the seas, which are always provided for in the statutes of limitation, and it is only fair that the same principle of law should be applied here.  If a person goes out of the country and comes back, a slight extension of time ought to be made to meet that case.</P>

      <P>I know there are a considerable number of girls who do go to England and have their children born there.  They come back, but I think in nearly every one of these cases they leave their children in England and never bring them back to this country.  The mother goes to England for the purpose of concealing from her neighbours <Col N="136" /> the fact that she is pregnant. She comes back and conceals, as far as she can, from her neighbours the fact that a child was born.  If there are exceptional cases where the mother goes to England and the child is born there, and she decides to bring it back instead of leaving the child in a home there, which is the practice, as I understand from persons who have given me information, the ordinary woman would come home in the ordinary time, and if you accept six months as the proper period I do not see how any exception should be made in her case.</P>

      <P>I dislike the machinery proposed to be set up by sub-section (1) of Section 2.  It is an innovation in legislation as far as I am aware because it is proposed under this sub-section to put the clerk of the District Court in a judicial position.</P>
      <P>To put him in a judicial position is a matter of very great importance from the public point of view.  I am speaking now of sub-section (1) of Section 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>Upon the application, within the time hereinafter limited, of the mother of an illegitimate child or on the application, within the time hereinafter limited, of a local body administering the relief of the poor then giving relief to the mother of an illegitimate child or to an illegitimate child and in either case upon an information in writing upon oath being made by the mother of such child identifying the father of such child there may be issued out of the District Court in the District in which such mother resides to the person (in this Act referred to as the alleged father) identified in such information as the father of such child a summons or other process calling on him to show cause why an order (in this Act called an affiliation order) should not be made against him in respect of such child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, and I think I am right in this, under the law as it stands the clerk of a District Court has authority, except in one very limited class of case, to issue a summons without going before the District Justice.  It is a matter of office procedure.  But this section proposes to put the clerk of a District Court in the position of a judicial officer.  No doubt the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;<Col N="139" /> is there giving him discretion.  I think it is contrary to the Constitution to put the clerk of a District Court, as this sub-section, if passed, would do, in a judicial position, to use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to give him authority to issue processes. The importance of the section, as it appears to me, is this, that it enables the clerk of a District Court to issue what in law is called a conditional order.  Deputies will pardon me for using what is a technical expression. I use it because it is the expression that best conveys to my mind, and I hope to Deputies, the meaning of the order.  A conditional order is an order that has not yet been made absolute.  Under the sub-section power is given to have a conditional order issued by the clerk of the District Court under which a person is to be deemed to be the putative father of a child.  I think that would be open to the very gravest abuse, because any woman who is the mother, or about to become the mother, of an illegitimate child can implead any man whom she selects and have a summons issued against him.  That will be a matter of record and will remain, for practical purposes, for the rest of that man's life.  It will remain on the files of the court as an indictment against him that he is the father of an illegitimate child.  I do not think that such a process is a desirable innovation.  Under the law at present an affiliation order can only be got on a judicial proceeding before a magistrate.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on motion by Deputy Ryan:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is the opinion of the Dáil that proposals for legislation should be introduced by the Executive Council to provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the establishment of a Wheat Control Board, which <Col N="140" /> shall be a Limited Liability Company, charged with the purchase of imported wheat for re-sale to millers and the fixing of a minimum price to be paid by Saorstát millers for home-grown wheat sold to them for milling purposes;</P>
    <P>(b)  for the prohibition of the importation of wheat by any person other than the Wheat Control Board and such persons as may be authorised by the Board;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the payment by the Board to Saorstát millers of such sums as may be necessary to make good the difference between the price paid by the millers for home-grown wheat and its market value, compared with Pacific Wheat, taking into account its higher moisture content;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to subscribe to the capital of the company, and to make good any losses incurred by the company in the administration of the scheme, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the importation of flour be permitted only under licence issued by the Wheat Control Board, and subject to an import duty; provided that there shall be no restrictions on flour imported for biscuit manufacture.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In resuming the debate on this motion, I do not propose to take up the time of the House very much longer.  I just wish to call the attention of Deputies to a few points I put before them when discussing the question before the Christmas recess.  I then quoted extensively from the journal of the Department.  As a farmer interested in the work of the Department, in the lessons that we are expected to learn from the experiments carried out by qualified and trained men who have been through colleges under the control of the Department, by men selected for their ability to guide the Irish farmer <Col N="141" /> and teach him the right principles of agriculture, I think the reports emanating from such a body are deserving of more than passing reference.  I challenge those Deputies who are anxious to turn down this motion to say whether they have carefully considered all the evidence given in Departmental literature, as a result of experiments, in favour of wheat growing in Ireland.  I think there are quite a number of Deputies who will admit that they have not examined that evidence.  For that reason I ask to be allowed to bring to the notice of the House some points that I consider to be vital.  In the Department's report for 1925-26, dealing with extensive experiments carried out during that year, I find the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The wheat variety experiments which the Department have conducted annually throughout the country for a period extending over twenty years have demonstrated that in practically every county in the Saorstát there are large areas where heavy crops of wheat can normally be successfully propagated.</P>
      <P>That report is well worthy of being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. Gorry Mr. Gorry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as a result of experiments in wheat growing carried out over a period of twenty years by men qualified to take charge of such experiments, by men experimenting for the purpose of finding out what is best for the Irish farmer, you find in a journal printed by the Department of Agriculture a statement such as I have just quoted surely it is worthy of the attention of farmers, and of legislators if it comes into their sphere to interfere on behalf of Irish farmers.  I say that it does come within the scope of legislators and of this House, and therefore I have no hesitation in bringing it to the notice of the House.  I appeal to all members, irrespective of Party affiliations, to settle down and examine the Department's <Col N="142" /> journal on this matter. If they do so they will find all along the line that the great bulk of the evidence is in favour of giving wheat-growing favourable consideration. Again, from an authority selected by the Department, from the Irish millers, we find that the largest proportion of the samples of native wheat examined by them is classified as of excellent quality. They state that the flour was very bright and granular, that it was an excellent sample of flour.  If we can produce an excellent sample of flour from native wheat, and that is the clear statement we have from expert millers in this country, surely it is worthy of consideration.  In the baking test, carried out and conducted by Irish millers, we find the same result.  They have classified the flour produced from native wheat as being of high quality for baking purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the value of the crop and contrasting it with the other cereals we grow here, oats and barley, we find that where the soil has been suitable, and where the farmer has been careful enough to get good seed and put it into a suitable field, the results are satisfactory. Out of almost 500 plots sown in 25 out of 26 counties, we find that the average yield extending over two seasons was 23 cwt. per statute acre or 38 cwt. to the Irish acre, approximately 14 barrels. In 1925-26 the average was 23 cwt. per statute acre, and in 1926-27, 26 cwt. to the statute acre. That is very favourable.  While saying that, I know that in most farms there are some fields unsuitable for wheat-growing.  Now and again it might happen in rotation that a season would come when a farmer could not wisely grow a wheat crop. If in a particular year adverse climatic conditions prevail, wheat could be imported to make up the deficiency.  I maintain that practically every farmer in the country could and would be well advised to grow wheat, even to the extent of half an acre or an acre.  If all the farmers could be prevailed upon to <Col N="143" /> do that and they were queried as to the results in the next harvest a majority would be in favour of this motion.  The proof of the pudding, as the saying is, is in the eating.</P>
    <P>Since the adjournment for the Christmas Recess I have enquired of many farmers as to their views on wheat-growing, and I found that while a number did not consider the policy advocated a wise one, the majority of them favoured it.  They say that at the prices quoted here, 30s. to 32s. per barrel, with an assured market for the grain, wheat-growing would be an attractive proposition for Irish farmers as against the prevailing, or likely to be prevailing, prices for oats or barley.  In the year the growing of oats or barley did not prove to be a very satisfactory matter.  Farmers have been urged to increase the area under oats by some of the Deputies in the course of this debate, even though the results for the last season as regards the growing of oats were not profitable.  Anyone connected with the oats market, and particularly the farmers, were certainly not pleased with the results. Oats sold at from 9s. to 10s. a barrel, and in many cases the farmers were pressing the merchants to buy the grain from them.  I would be in favour of advocating the laying down of test plots by farmers, especially those who doubt the results of the experiments about which they read.  It would be a blessing if we had a majority of our people using a good deal more of home products, particularly wheat meal and flour produced from the home grown cereal.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on this subject on the last occasion I quoted figures showing the value of the crops, taking what I considered the average yields: I took first the yields from the experimental plots, and then I got down to more likely figures.  A yield of 12 barrels of wheat to the Irish acre at 25/- a barrel would work out at £15.  I took 15 barrels of barley to the Irish acre, and at 16/- per barrel that <Col N="144" /> would yield £12.  I took 20 barrels of oats, per acre, which is not an uncommon figure, and at 11/6 a barrel that would work out at £13 10s.  These figures are not unfavourable to wheat-growing.  We have grown wheat practically every year except when prevented by climatic conditions, and I say that the difference in the handling of the crops is not very heavy, except where an adverse season comes in.  I know about the difficulties as regards smut and other things interfering with the value of the crop.  Every farmer will admit that from time to time he meets with losses in his crops of barley and oats.  You may have a splendid crop of oats or barley to-day, the admiration of the countryside, and overnight it might be flattened out by wind or rain.  I know the effect is not so serious if oats or barley &ldquo;lodged&rdquo; as if wheat &ldquo;lodged,&rdquo; but it goes to prove that people who try to build up too strong a case against wheat-growing, and who paint a very favourable picture in favour of oats and barley, are not playing fair with the subject under debate.  I am confident that a great number of farmers would agree with me that at, say the 30/- figure, and taking the prevailing price for corn in this country, you would get a very large area put under wheat.  In 1917 the area under wheat rose to 100,000 acres, because there was a prospect of increased price.  When we take into consideration the value of the offal for feeding purposes, and practically 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. of the wheat used for milling purposes could be classified as offal and used for live stock feeding purposes, I think it would be to the advantage of the Irish farmer to have more control of that part of the foodstuffs that he has to buy.  It is not unknown for us to have jumps of £1 and £1 10s. per ton for feeding stuffs. That is not at all uncommon when we are depending on millers at the other side of the Channel for our needs over and above what our native millers supply.  We are in the unhappy position of using flour that <Col N="145" /> has been denuded of offal in outside mills, and very often if our merchants apply for more offal they cannot get it.  We are told that the British market is the market for the sale of our products.  We do not contend that it is not.  We have the British farmers, however, placed in an advantageous position as against us by having access to cheaper offal. We have to bring foodstuffs across here from England, make use of them, and send over our live-stock and bacon to be sold in the same market.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture would give very sound advice to his Department if he would order, even at the present moment, though we are coming into the spring, a reprint of the reports that were issued in 1925-26 and in 1926-27 on the wheat-growing experiments, and send out these reports wholesale all over the country for the perusal of our farmers.  In that way, the Minister would help to give this matter a chance of fair consideration, because there are throughout the country people who have prejudiced opinions and people who lack experience, and are very easily prejudiced one way or another. To sum up, as far as I read of the experiments that were carried out, and as one interested in the development of Irish agriculture, I am satisfied that the large-scale experiments, the 500 experiments laid down carefully under expert control all over the Free State, gave the result that wheat could be grown satisfactorily in this country, and that there were large areas in the country suitable for wheat-growing. Some of our Irish millers, and these some of the most prominent, gave it as their opinion that a satisfactory and high quality flour can be produced from our wheat. What is of the utmost importance to our farmers, it was found that in value the results were very favourable.</P>
    <P>I think that we could easily put it up to the Irish farmers that here is a chance of getting an extra return for their labour.  The farmers are not well paid for their labour at the moment, and they have not been <Col N="146" /> well paid for their labour in the past.  Particularly at harvest time, when selling their grain crops, they are, and have reason to be, dissatisfied. Even if wheat were to be substituted for another grain crop, that would be altogether to the good.  It would increase the demand for barley and oats.  It would not have been any harm in the seasons gone by if some of the areas under oats and barley had been planted under wheat.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who have still to speak in opposition to the motion will consider the case very fairly, and that they will not try to bolster up opinions against the motion, opinions which cannot be sustained and opinions which are in opposition to the expert opinion of those who have been told off by the Department of Agriculture to conduct these experiments, and have conducted them satisfactorily all over the country. I ask the Dáil to give favourable consideration to Deputy Ryan's motion.  I believe it would be of the utmost advantage to our Irish farmers if this motion were passed. In three or four years, when the general body of farmers become accustomed to wheat-growing, a lot of the difficulties that are now supposed to exist will disappear.  A few years ago we had quite a lot of talk about the possibilities of growing beet in this country for and against.  Last season happened to be favourable, and we got good results from our beet crop.  The 1928 season was not quite so favourable and the results were quite below the past season.  I submit that there are very favourable prospects for development of wheat-growing in this country, and for that reason I am wholeheartedly in support of Deputy Ryan's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when this subject was debated, Deputy Lemass made an eloquent speech in which he admitted he had no practical knowledge at all of what he was talking about.  Yet he proceeded to lecture the Free State farmer as to what he should grow. He told him that it would be to his <Col N="147" /> advantage to grow wheat, and also that it would be to the advantage of the community.  He told us it was foolish to concentrate on live-stock or live-stock products.  He proceeded to quote authorities in support of his argument.  He said, &ldquo;As I said, I am not a farmer.  I do not pretend to know anything about husbandry. The belief which I hold is that the concentration on the production for export of live-stock and live-stock products is going to prove much less profitable in future than it has proved in the past.  I think it is unwise for farmers, in their own interests, even thinking of the mere matter of the profits which they are to get from their labour, to contemplate increased concentration upon the production for export of live-stock and live-stock products.  They would be very much wiser to vary the production and to endeavour to supply to a larger extent than they are at present supplying the home market which is available for them, the principal part of which is for wheat and wheat flour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then he quotes from the &ldquo;Statist&rdquo; of July 27th, 1929:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The past four weeks show a substantial decline in cattle exports through the port of Dublin, there being 33,387 as against 49,280 in the corresponding period of last year.  Prices are still substantially below last year's level and the low prices obtaining at English markets offer very little encouragement to speculative buying...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass had any knowledge of his subject he would not have quoted that in support of his argument.  The chief reason for the slump in live stock in June and July last year is as follows: In 1928 there were very good crops both in Scotland and England.  The Scotch and English farmers fed an immense lot of cattle through the winter and spring of 1928-29.  I have nearly 35 years' experience of the live stock trade and I do not remember stallfeds ever being as late on the English markets as they were last June <Col N="148" /> and July.  After July, when these cattle were finished, the demand for Irish cattle improved considerably. Against the authority quoted by Deputy Lemass, and against his pessimism about the future of our live stock trade, other authorities hold that the outlook for live stock is improving and prices will tend to harden.  The reason given is that the United States of America, which at one time exported a large quantity of meat to Great Britain, is now an importing country and it takes Canada's surplus.  Also, the cattle population of the Argentine, which is now the largest exporter of beef to Great Britain, has decreased of recent years.  Many well-informed people think the prices of live stock will improve.</P>
    <P>If, instead of urging this fetish for wheat-growing, Deputy Ryan and his Party would encourage the Free State farmer to grow what he can and as much as he can of first quality, it would be more advisable. The Free State farmer should be encouraged to produce what he can sell at a profit&mdash;beef, mutton, pork, butter, eggs and poultry.  He should be encouraged to raise on his own farm as much foodstuffs as possible and to produce these commodities in first-class condition.  If the Deputies opposite would do that, then they would be doing something useful for the Irish farmer.  That would be a sounder economic policy than trying to get the Irish farmer to grow wheat of which he cannot produce a first-class sample because of the moist climate and, even then, only at a price which is very much higher than that at which wheat can be produced elsewhere.  In my opinion it is no use talking of a subsidy or a bounty for wheat-growing for the reason that, taking the ratio of wealth produced by agriculture and produced by industry, the Free State farmer would pay a large portion of the subsidy himself.  In other countries such as Germany, where the main wealth consists of the export of manufactured goods, the farmer can be subsidised without paying the subsidy out of his own pocket.  It <Col N="149" /> would be just as reasonable to advise an Eskimo to dress in the cotton loin cloth of an Afrikander as to tell farmers in the Free State that they should have the wheat subsidy simply because another country has.</P>
    <P>As a practical farmer, even were it possible to subsidise wheat, I see many difficulties in growing wheat on a large scale.  In order to grow wheat for our needs nearly every acre of manured ground would require to be sown; that is, where potatoes, mangolds, turnips and beet have been grown.  That would be impossible on account of the weather in the late autumn.  The conditions of growing wheat here and in Canada are very different. Here it requires about ten months to mature and in Canada it requires only six months.  It can be grown there for years in succession, but in this country you can only grow wheat every fifth or sixth year as a rotation crop.  You can only grow wheat with any hope of success after a manured crop.  The difficulty I see is to get these crops out in time and before the land gets too wet.  The turnip crop is not generally lifted until November or December, and then it is physically impossible to sow wheat.  The land is too wet and it is also too late in the season.  Of course I am only talking of winter wheat, because it is the only wheat I could get a good crop out of.  I tried several varieties of spring wheat, but got indifferent results.  It was a light crop always and it would ripen too late.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate I heard no Deputy say what percentage of the Free State farmers would take advantage of the subsidy if you could have one.  You must consider that there are some counties and large portions of other counties where no wheat could be grown, and you have also a number of small farmers who could not grow a surplus for milling purposes.  I think the number of farmers who could take advantage of the subsidy would not be more than fifty per cent.  I would suggest that if money could be found for subsidising wheat it <Col N="150" /> should instead be applied for the purpose of de-rating agricultural land.  Every farmer would then benefit more or less and not the favoured few who have suitable land for the growing of wheat.  I am a farmer in County Meath and have as good wheat land as there is in the Free State.  I run a mixed tillage and grazing farm, tilling about thirty Irish acres, so that I think I can claim that I know something about tillage.  Up to 1914 I always grew some wheat, but I have given it up for two reasons.  The first reason was that I require a large quantity of good hay for feeding with my roots to stall-fed cattle. My experience is that the hay crop after wheat is much lighter and inferior in quality than after oats or barley, or, in fact, any other cereal. It has also been my experience that land is much poorer after wheat than after oats or barley.  My second reason for preferring oats to wheat is that oaten straw is very useful with roots for store cattle in the spring.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite need not laugh about feeding oaten straw to store cattle.  Mixed tillage cannot be carried on without live stock, and if you have live stock you have to feed them.  People who are large farmers and who feed a large number of cattle must remember that the small farmer who rears stock must have an outlet for his stores.  The sum total of my argument is that I agree with Deputy Gorry, that from one acre of wheat you might get a little better cash results than from an acre of oats, but, when you take into consideration the better hay crop after oats or barley and the feeding value of oaten straw, I, as a practical farmer, am convinced that oats give better results on a mixed tillage farm.</P>

      <P>This subject has been dealt with by so many farming experts that it may seem presumptuous for anyone who is not a farmer to attempt to speak upon it, but we all are sent here to do the business of our country, and it seems to me that the figures of the <Col N="151" /> past few general elections, whatever they may have shown, have not shown that farmers appreciate or support the policy laid down here by the so-called Farmers' Party. They certainly do not believe in that policy, and the next general election will show that whatever support that particular policy got in the past, it will get none at all next time.  The reason for that is obvious.  The Farmers' Party have no policy, in the first place, in regard to the cutting down of expenditure for which they were sent here.</P>

      <P>A discussion on the Farmers' Party is, I hope, just as much in order as a discussion on the cattle trade with which Deputy Mathews occupied a large part of the time of the House.  I can assure the Minister for Agriculture that I will not take long in getting back to the subject.  As I have said, the cutting down of expenditure is one of the things for which the Farmers' Party were sent here, and another thing, I take it, for which they were sent was to try and get some policy which would help to bridge over the present period of agricultural depression, and which would increase production and help the farmers to get better prices.  The Minister for Agriculture stated frequently that that cannot be done by tariffs on agricultural produce.  He says that we are selling our agricultural produce in an international market, and since that market is outside our control, tariffs are of no use.  Apart from our agricultural exports, there is the question of our agricultural imports, and I cannot believe that the Party on the Government benches agree with the Minister for Agriculture when he says that that ruling, that that definition of his policy&mdash;that anything smacking of tariffs and subsidies cannot help <Col N="152" /> agriculture&mdash;represents the feeling on his own side of the House.</P>
      <P>We know that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party some years ago were very strongly in favour of compulsory tillage, tillage which would not merely be compulsory by virtue of being the law of the land, but a system of tillage which was to be financed by duties placed on foreign agricultural commodities.  We know that a very strong volume of opinion was in favour of that policy among the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, some of whose members still adorn the benches of this House.  They saw the population fleeing from the country, they saw that agriculture was getting into a desperate condition and, with the best will in the world towards the Minister and his efforts, they felt that his policy of concentrating on dairy produce alone would not solve the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>They saw that that policy would not help to maintain our population on the land.  The question of wheat, I submit, is more fundamental than any other part of our agricultural policy.  It will always be a necessity in the country. There will always be a steady demand for it, amounting in value to £7,000,000 a year.  The whole of that money is going into foreign hands at present although it is within our grasp and capacity to keep it in circulation here.  I submit that, whatever the technical difficulties or whatever the personal experiences of individual members of the so-called Farmers' Party and those who think with them may be, there are in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party a number of people of sufficient national sentiment to realise that there is a national aspect to this question also, and that the matter of retaining the sum of £7,000,000 per annum in this country is of great importance.  When we consider that our adverse trade balance amounts to £13,000,000, it stands to reason <Col N="153" /> that if the £7,000,000 could be kept at home that adverse trade balance would immediately fall away.  In addition, it would put money into circulation in the country.  We see that the Governments of Great Britain, America and other countries are trying to improve the purchasing power of the people, and they realise that with the great increase in machinery and the enormous vogue in advertising, as well as the increasingly high standard of living, people must have more money at their disposal.  Our agricultural community has not enough money at its disposal to pay its way let alone to maintain the position which circumstances are forcing on it of living up to what I said to-day was a false standard, but at any rate it is a standard which is generally accepted and from which, unfortunately, we cannot go back unless we force down wages, which would, of course, mean forcing down the under-dog all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to try to go ahead and raise the income of the people. Deputy Mathews and others told us about the possibilities in the cattle trade, but all that they tell us in the end is that it depends on the Argentine to some extent whether our export trade to Great Britain is going to be remunerative or not, that if there should be some change in some of the countries on the other side of the globe our cattle trade may be crippled, just as it was threatened before by the Canadian cattle trade. There are also large areas in the country which, we submit, have not got any benefit from the present policy of concentrating on dairy products. I understood the Minister for Agriculture last autumn to say that the beet subsidy was not likely to continue very much longer.  If that is removed whatever slight security the farmers in that particular area where beet is grown had that they would get some kind of stabilised prices will also be removed.  So far as I can see, the Irish tillage farmer will be abandoned, and I do not see any prospect of the policy of the self-contained farm being effective. <Col N="154" /> The size of Irish farms varies greatly. In addition, we must remember that, owing to the standard of living which has been forced upon us, our farmers must have money and must keep their children at a standard of living far higher than children were kept twenty or thirty years ago, and they must pay expenses which formerly they had not to pay.</P>
    <P>All these things, in addition to the heavy slump in prices which they have experienced, mean that our farmers must get cash, as if they do not get cash returns it will be impossible for them to make ends meet, let alone to keep up the present standard. Surely there is nothing heretical&mdash;on the contrary, it is advisable from the national point of view&mdash;in trying to keep that £7,000,000 in the country.  If we were to start a new industry like the Shannon Scheme or the manufacture of sugar beet the money would be kept at home, but there is still more reason to take the wheat industry and try and keep the money in it at home.  No matter what people say, most farmers have experience of growing wheat, and the only thing that will keep them from growing it, or any other crop, is the question of price.  We suggest that in the present agricultural depression it is worth considering whether we cannot go the whole way towards meeting our requirements. We want to set up a body that will control the imports of wheat, that will give such price to our farmers as will enable them to grow wheat properly, and to supply a large percentage of our requirements from home-grown wheat.  We are told that that is going to cost money.  So it is.  In the present state of affairs, which discloses very little in the way of advancement, everyone will, I think, agree that every farmer is losing money.</P>
    <P>Some bank managers admit that agriculture is not thriving, and even those who have had the courage to state that the harvest was good have forgotten to say how the harvest was marketed, what price the farmer realised and whether it sufficed to pay his expenses.  It may have <Col N="155" /> sufficed to pay the bank, but I am certain it did not pay the farmer's way.</P>
    <P>We are asked for de-rating. People are asking that £2,000,000 should be placed at the disposal of the agricultural community in the form of abolishing rates on agricultural land.  That has to be given, I take it, without imposing any restrictions or conditions on the grant of that relief, if it is granted, and it is probably going to mean extra taxation.  A great many people say that de-rating relief is necessary, that it is only natural that the farmers here should claim to be placed on the same basis as farmers in the Six Counties and in England.  If it is good policy to give de-rating relief to all classes of farmers without any conditions, I cannot see why it should not be good policy to subsidise a thing which would have a specific advantage for the country, by which you would, in the first place, keep all this money in circulation at home, and, in the second place, be giving a fillip to agriculture, a fillip which would undoubtedly react on other industries. If we take that £7,000,000 and keep it at home, we can be sure that the whole lot of it is not going to leave the country again as so much unfortunately is leaving it at present.  We can take it that a great deal of the money is going to go back into Irish industry and is going to be the foundation of investments, capital and savings which will be kept in the country.  If we take that £7,000,000 and endeavour to keep it at home, in that way we are doing a very sensible thing.  We are putting money into circulation where very little money is in circulation, and I think that consideration is a very important one.</P>
    <P>We are all for developing our industries, but our industrial policy has not carried us very far.  Any newspaper critic is able to point out the comparatively small amount of employment our tariffs have given. Our little industries are either faced by rationalisation and huge combines <Col N="156" /> in other countries or they are faced by big combines coming into the country which threaten to wipe them out.  We are faced with a tariff policy that has merely resulted in the assimilation of our industries by foreigners.  Agriculture is the one industry which can never get into the hands of the foreigner and which must always remain in the hands of the Irish people, but it certainly will not be an inducement to the Irish people to develop it unless the House really says that it is out to give relief.  Unless we really mean to do something for agriculture we cannot expect the people to have the right spirit.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether all the members on the opposite side think that the farmers are satisfied with the present state of affairs.  I am certain that in my area, once the sugar beet subsidy, which is by no means as profitable as people would imagine, is withdrawn, the farmers will be practically thrown on the dole.  We want some policy that will stabilise prices to some extent.  It may be impossible to stabilise prices in the case of cattle, butter, or in the case of those goods which are sold abroad, but surely we should not tolerate the situation of having an enormous adverse trade balance and having large numbers of our farmers unable to pay their way, when we would be keeping this money in circulation here if we simply adopted some policy such as Deputy Dr. Ryan has outlined.</P>
    <P>In addition, we still have to import from abroad; we are setting up embassies and legations in other countries, and we are talking about trade treaties.  I do not know in what commodities we are going to have commerce with other countries unless we are going to become a dumping ground for Germany and other countries as we are already for the English.  We are in the unfortunate position that our industries are not developed and are not likely to be developed for a considerable time. During that period, if we wanted to <Col N="157" /> get trade advantages we could buy our wheat, or large parcels of it, from different countries, and try and get concessions from these countries so as to build up a direct trade when we consider it advisable.</P>
    <P>I do not think the argument that this is a fetish should really hold. It is not a fetish.  It is getting attention in every country.  In Canada and Australia, farmers have formed themselves into large monopoly pools and the smaller countries of Europe have taken steps to preserve their wheat supply, partly by encouraging it at home, and partly by purchasing abroad.  We read in the English papers that there is a movement in England to set up some kind of a wheat organisation because of the extreme fluctuations. When people say in this House that this subsidy is going to cost money we admit it is, but the present state of affairs is also costing money, as the people are living on land on which they are not producing.  We must endeavour to get them to produce. If we must get them to do it by coercive measures those may be tried, but a little appreciation of the fact that the times are very hard, that the country must make a real sacrifice to pull agriculture out of the slough, would count for more than anything else to get the country going again.</P>
    <P>There was a question on the Paper to-day with reference to the price of flour.  The matter has been raised here several times.  It was pointed out that in spite of the enormous slump in wheat prices that reduction has not reached the consumer. Neither will it reach him in the future.  It is generally known that the wheat crops of the world get into the hands of a very small number of agents.  That may force the price up.  We could argue that the price is likely to increase in the future just as Deputy Mathews argues that the price of meat is likely to increase.  There would be good ground for saying that wheat prices are going to increase in the future but whether they increase or <Col N="158" /> decrease, we do not seem to feel the benefit of the fluctuations.  If they increase, our farmers do not get the benefit.  If they decrease, the purchasers of bread do not get it and the fact that there has been hardly any appreciable reduction in bread prices shows that in the present price of bread the consumer is paying a heavy subsidy and is getting no credit for it.  It is going into the hands of individual traders.  It is not going as a subsidy which would be open and under public inspection and control and which might be dropped if not found satisfactory. It is not going to give employment and to build up a national industry.</P>
    <P>This is a large question and ought to be dealt with in a large manner. It is a question which affects tillage. All economists in all times and all countries, whatever may be the spirit of the present age, believe that the fundamental policy of any Government, of any State that is out for the welfare of its people, is to maintain the population on the land. It was that that made Germany great.  But we, whatever talk there may be about our agriculture and about our development and about our scientific methods, have not got to the bottom of that question&mdash; keeping our population on the soil. If the price that is suggested in this motion is heavy, I suggest, if it achieves its purpose, it is worth it and that any price in hundreds of thousands of pounds could not be possibly too great for the advantages of giving the agriculturist the feeling that he had a Government determined to see that he would get a price that would cover his cost of production.  We must remember also in that connection that there is a feeling&mdash;which is generally voiced by the so-called Farmers' Party and is one I do not agree with, because I do not think it is being used for good purposes&mdash;that the farmers if they are the taxpayers of this country are paying heavily for the support of industry.  They are paying undoubtedly and it is only natural that we should support them in some way financially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> That great country Australia has proclaimed its intention of getting work for its citizens by developing its own industries and resources, irrespective of the claims and interests of other countries.  You have a tariff on agricultural implements, one of the things I am sure Irish farmers would be the first to decry. Strange to say, the tariff on agricultural implements is very popular in Australia and New Zealand, also other tariffs which it is recognised the farmers are paying for.  The Australian people think the farmers should get something in return and you have the position which some of our people who are terribly interested in the cost of living would consider very shocking, that in Australia Australian butter bears a tax of fourpence a lb. and New Zealand butter sixpence a lb.  That is a direct subsidy and encouragement to agriculture in Australia.  In Australia and Canada, they have undertaken measures like this where they have all the newest ideas, huge ranches and huge pieces of machinery.  I saw that on the ranches in Canada last year owing to a certain change that was made in reaping machinery they were able in one district in the western area to do away with 10,000 harvesters.  They can make economies like that in these countries and compete with us in our markets while at the same time they fall back on the policy of giving a direct subsidy to farmers. I do not see that there is anything wrong in proposing some such measure here.  If we did not believe the situation was serious and that a bold, statesmanlike policy was necessary in order to remedy it we would not be in favour of spending this money.  It is because we believe that this is the only solution of the question, that it is something which will definitely place tillage in the ascendency and give the working farmer the feeling that we are behind him, that we support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan's motion is an endeavour to <Col N="160" /> accomplish the impossible, and he asks the Government to pass it in the interests of the Irish farmer.  We all know the ability of Free State farmers, and of Irish farmers generally. I think they require very few lectures from Deputy Ryan on the conduct of their business.  Farmers require very little instruction from some of the specialists in agriculture as to the management of their farms.  They have been managing farms for many years, and while they may do so in a conservative way, there are very few countries able to teach the people of this country how to handle farms, how to get the best products, and how to realise the best value for those products. If for nothing else but the way in which this motion is presented to the House, I would move its rejection.  It proposes that a Wheat Control Board should be set up, with unlimited powers for the purchase of wheat.  That will be creating new positions.</P>
      <P>Another portion of the motion asks &ldquo;That the Minister for Finance be authorised to subscribe to the capital of the company, and to make good any losses incurred by the company in the administration of the scheme, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Did anyone ever hear of such a request coming from a Deputy?  To call upon the Minister for Finance to subsidise the Board with an unlimited amount of capital, no matter where it came from, and to hand it over to a Wheat Control Board!  Does Deputy Ryan seriously consider that the House could entertain such a motion, no matter who was to benefit?  The proposal is ridiculous in the extreme. Irish farmers produce wheat when it suits them to do so.  They have produced corn, bacon, beef, butter and eggs by means of mixed farming and in that way have been pretty successful.  Farmers have nothing to learn from Deputy Ryan or any of the other Deputies who spoke in favour of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been asked: why not compete with Canada; why not <Col N="161" /> compete with the United States?  It has also been stated that so far as competition is concerned we are in a hopeless condition.  It has been suggested that we have only to sow wheat, wait for a certain time and the crop will be fit to cut, thrash and harvest.  When we sow our wheat, we have to contend with the uncertainty of the weather.  When we get it to a certain maturity, and when it requires one or two weeks more to ripen, we often fail to get favourable weather at the particular time, with the result that the farmer, after all the expense, is at a loss.  Still, this is the crop that should be subsidised and that a Wheat Control Board with unlimited capital should be set up to purchase.  It must be remembered that any loss sustained by the Board must be made up by the State, and by the farmers eventually. On the other hand, we are told that £7,000,000 are spent in purchasing wheat from other countries. How much of that money would be spent on labour in this country? Would it not cost £14,000,000 to produce the same amount of wheat here?  You will see that the farmer in his wise judgment produces the article that pays him.  He purchases £7,000,000 worth of wheat and has £7,000,000 in reserve.</P>
    <P>One would fancy that the members on this side of the House are entirely opposed to tillage.  They are not.  I have always advocated tillage to the fullest extent.  Every time that I go through my constituency I advocate more tillage, but the tillage I advocate is the tillage that pays farmers best.  There is no use asking farmers in the south of Ireland to produce alfalfa and commodities that are grown in other countries and that cannot be grown here.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side are asking the House to do the impossible&mdash;to grow grape-nuts.  They will not do that.  If for no other reason than the way in which this motion is worded, I think it simply ridiculous. Members on the other side connected with farming who give it due consideration know that it is utterly impossible to expect any Government <Col N="162" /> to accept the motion in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if Deputy Connolly or any of the Deputies who are opposing the motion contend that if Belgium, France, or any of the European countries who go in for encouraging wheat production, dropped tariffs in the form of subsidies they could economically compete with Canada, the United States and other places in wheat production?  Would they further contend that in the production of other cereals such as oats, rye and barley, if tariffs and subsidies were removed, these European countries could compete with new countries?  Deputy Derrig maintained that the basic policy of agriculture should be to keep the population on the land.  In France, the present Prime Minister said that the greatness of France was its rural population and that the policy of the Government would be to take such steps as were necessary to prevent that rural population from diminishing. If we had a proper agricultural economy here, our policy should be the same&mdash;to keep the population on the land.  You can have a form of agricultural prosperity&mdash;and I believe that is the form of prosperity that is in the mind of the present Department of Agriculture&mdash;wherein you enumerate your wealth by the number of flocks and herds in the country. Eventually you can visualise a time when you will have twenty or thirty big ranches such as you have in the Argentine, and you can call that prosperity, or have the prosperity advocated in this motion, a prosperity begot by tillage and the employment of your own people.  We have very wealthy farmers in Co. Meath owning hundreds of acres. The tendency, with the disappearance of tillage, is for the small holders to disappear.  I live near Meath and I notice that as tillage decreases the population decreases. You have not to refer to the Census to know that the small holder disappears as quickly as the demand for his products decreases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmer Deputies have told us what they do.  They do what suits them, irrespective of the welfare of the country.  The best farmer for the country is the man that turns a big percentage of his land into tillage.  No farmer is doing that voluntarily at present; he is doing the least possible amount of tillage that he can.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs to see neighbours of my own with 300 Irish acres of the best land buying a barrel of oats or a load of turnips in the market.  We are told by Deputy Connolly to leave them alone, that they know what is best for themselves.  They know what is best for themselves and to hell with the country!  As other members of the community have to toe the line for the welfare of the country, so those people who have the land of the country should toe the line and do what is best in the national interest. The first thing necessary in the national interest is to keep the population here, or else we can scoff at Lalor when he talks about a peasantry rooted in the soil.  Apparently that is now regarded as claptrap.  We must produce economically; we must have the big ranches with a couple of herds and a couple of dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Deputy Dr. Hennessy told us that the making of an acre of hay employs more people than the sowing, cutting and binding of an acre of wheat.  That is an extraordinary statement which hardly needs contradiction.  He also talked about the nutritious grass for a cow. If I let a cow out in the month of December on this nutritious grass and I have another cow which is fed on cereals, we will see which gives the best milk production.  There is a time and a place for everything.  It is all right in the spring, but there is no use letting a cow out in December or January, and talking of the <Col N="164" /> benefits of nutritious grass as compared with cereals.</P>
    <P>We are also told about the number of weeks if takes to mature Irish wheat and other grain.  I remember reading that the agricultural research department in an American University&mdash;I think it was Harvard &mdash;when the new settlement was being made in Palestine evolved a special wheat for that country.  The same department also evolved a grain for Northern Columbia.  If it was possible to evolve or breed wheat suitable for these two totally different places, it should be possible for a research department to evolve a grain that will be suitable to our climate. Naturally, if you take a grain that is not native to the soil, or that has not been acclimatised, so to speak, you will not get the results that you should.  But, if you take the trouble and breed wheat, such as we had here in the 'forties before the famine, you will get wheat which will harden in time and give you the results you want.</P>
    <P>As I said, all this talk of producing economically is sheer nonsense. No country in Europe recognises such a thing as producing economically in a world sense, because if you take down your barriers you will be snowed under.  As Deputy Derrig said, it has been recognised in England that the duty of a Government is to take such protective measures as will keep the population in the country from being snowed under by the mass producer elsewhere. Therefore, wheat being a permanent necessity and a permanent need here, and as there is always a market for it, it is the duty of the Irish Government to take steps to see that all the wheat that is needed is produced within the country and, therefore, the adoption of this motion is a national necessity.</P>
