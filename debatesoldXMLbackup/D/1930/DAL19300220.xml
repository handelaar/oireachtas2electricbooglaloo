      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a labourer's cottage has been taken over by the Gárda Síochána and used as a barrack in Glantane, Mallow, County Cork; if the cottage was taken over by force, and to whom is the rent paid.</P>

      <P>The premises at present occupied by the Gárda Síochána at Glentane were originally acquired under the Civic Guard (Acquisition of Premises) Act, 1923.  Subsequent to occupation, as a result of negotiations with Mrs. Nano Mullane, a formal agreement was arrived at whereby we obtained a monthly tenancy of the premises at £2 3s. 4d. per month inclusive of rates and maintenance.  Rent at this rate was paid to Mrs. Nano Mullane until we learnt of her death, since when payment has been made to Mr. Cornelius Mullane of Kilpadder, Mallow, the person who we are advised is entitled to receive the rent of the premises.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if Mr. Maurice Crowe, Glenbane, Lattin, Fianna Fáil Organiser for County Tipperary, was arrested and searched in Tipperary Town on December 13th, 1929; if correspondence in his possession relating to the Fianna Fáil Organisation was taken and read; if he was asked to give a list of subscribers to Fianna Fáil Funds; and, if so, why; if Mr. Crowe is being continuously <Col N="589" /> followed and annoyed by detective officers, and if the Minister will give instructions for these activities to cease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 13th December last Mr. Maurice Crowe of Glenbane, Lattin, was arrested in Tipperary town by a member of the Gárda Síochana who believed that Mr. Crowe was in possession of firearms.  Mr. Crowe was asked to come to the Police Barracks where he was searched.  During the course of the search a list of names was noticed to be in Mr. Crowe's possession.  He was asked what was the purpose of the list and he replied that it contained the names of subscribers to the Fianna Fáil collection. On receipt of this reply, he was asked no further questions regarding the list of names.  Mr. Crowe is not being continuously followed and annoyed by detective officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps is the Minister going to take to stop this work, or is it going to be allowed to be carried on?  Does the Minister mean to tell us that the C.I.D. men did not know what Mr. Crowe's position was in the Fianna Fáil movement?  I say it is a scandal and a disgrace if this class of work is allowed to be carried on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no political espionage on behalf of Cumann na nGaedheal.  These men, as the Deputy knows perfectly well, are searched not for Fianna Fáil documents, but for treasonable documents. As long as the Fianna Fáil Party remains as it is now I take it it is not a seditious association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice to state the facts upon which he has based his reasons for refusing to carry out the undertaking given in writing to appoint one person from a list supplied by the Fianna Fáil Party for the purpose of acting on the Visiting Committee to the prisoners in Mountjoy Jail, and whether, in view of certain recent <Col N="591" /> events and of complaints arising therefrom in reference to the treatment of several prisoners in that prison, he proposes to continue to override that written undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 24th November, 1927, I received a deputation from the Fianna Fáil Party to discuss the cases of certain prisoners, and in the course of the discussion the constitution of the Visiting Committee to Mountjoy Prison incidentally arose, whereupon I informed the deputation that I would favourably consider appointing on the Visiting Committee to Mountjoy Prison a person to be selected from a list of responsible citizens submitted by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Some considerable time later the Deputy, who was one of the deputation referred to, submitted the name of a doctor, whereupon I informed him that, as members of his Party had previously made attacks in the Dáil upon the medical officers attached to Mountjoy Prison, the appointment of a doctor would give the impression that I had not full confidence in the medical officers, and for that reason I could not consider the suggestion.  At that time I received no further suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 10th December, 1928, Deputy Little approached me again on the subject, and on that occasion I informed him that if a list of three or more sensible businessmen were put forward I would appoint one of them on the Visiting Committee to Mountjoy Prison, if the list contained the name of a suitable person. I received no list until 24th November, 1929, and on that date the Deputy submitted the name of the doctor whom I had previously rejected, his own name, and the name of another person.  In 1927, when I received the deputation above mentioned, I entertained the hope that the Fianna Fáil Party were genuinely interested in the preservation of order in the State.  In December, 1928, whilst I had some doubts as to whether my hopes were well-founded, I was prepared to take some risks in the matter, but in <Col N="592" /> November, 1929, when the Deputy's list was submitted, I came to the conclusion that any claim the Fianna Fáil Party might have had to have their views considered in making appointments of the nature in question had long since been forfeited.  I wrote to the Deputy on the 6th December, 1929, setting forth my views on the matter.  I observed that he published this letter in the issue of the weekly paper called the &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; dated 28th December last.  He also published a letter of his own of a party propagandist nature.  In view of all the propaganda the Deputy created for himself in the &ldquo;Nation&rdquo; of the 28th December last, I am at a loss to know what further purpose he thinks can be served by the present question.</P>
    <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, I have nothing to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was for the facts upon which the Minister has based his statement that the Fianna Fáil Party had ceased to be a Party with whom he could carry out that agreement.  I repeat that. I want to know what are the facts upon which he based the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I pointed out to the Deputy that he never sent forward the list of the three sensible businessmen, because I do not consider the Deputy himself as a sensible businessman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not call solicitors businessmen; I call them professional men.  Likewise, I have to inform the Deputy that the whole course which his Party has taken in this Dáil, during the last year, and the attacks they have frequently made upon the Gárda and the prison officials&mdash;no later than last night for instance&mdash;is full justification of the course I have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had three names from which to choose.  He <Col N="593" /> could have said, if he liked, that these names were not acceptable and asked for another list.  He did not do that, but he made charges against our Party and I am concerned to know the facts upon which he based those charges?</P>

      <P>I am acquainted with the proposals for a re-organisation of the industry which are under consideration by the Irish Flour Mills.  Pending a <Col N="597" /> general agreement in favour of the adoption of these proposals, which according to my information has not been reached, I do not consider that I could appropriately make any statement, but it should be clearly understood that no agreement arrived at privately within the industry can in any way diminish either the right or the duty of the Government to propose such measures for the safeguarding of the public interest as future developments might warrant.</P>

      <P>That is a question which may arise at a later date.  At the moment I am in touch with flour milling industrialists and am, I believe, getting full information from them.  If anything should happen that would lead me to believe that full information is not being given, and that it is necessary to get information on oath, I would then consider the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

Whether any or all of these men come within that I do not know.  How far the legislation has carried out the wish of the Oireachtas is a point on which there is doubt.

      <P>Yesterday evening I was dealing with some of the points raised by Deputies on the question of the appearance of the Irish delegation at the Tariff Truce Conference.  Deputy Lemass quoted extracts from newspapers, and from these sought to draw conclusions rather difficult to follow.  One time it seemed to me we had, contrary to his opinion of what was correct, decided to go there against the Truce.  Another time, contrary to his opinion, we decided to go there to support the Truce.  Another time, still contrary to his opinion, we went there not knowing whether we were going to support the Truce or to be against it.  This was founded on three newspaper excerpts.  In the first of these the political correspondent of an Irish newspaper said: &ldquo;The Free State Government has not yet decided whether it will participate actively in the Conference.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;actively&rdquo; is to be noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> In the second extract there was an account of an interview with myself in which I said&mdash;and there was a certain part of this which Deputy Lemass was unfortunate enough to leave out of his recital&mdash;&ldquo;Any suggestion that the decision of Saorstát Eireann to take part in this Conference indicates a fresh orientation of the Government policy on the matter of trade barriers is very wide of the mark.&rdquo; That is surely precise enough to start with.</P>
    <P>The newspaper says&mdash;not from me: &ldquo;The statement was with reference to a comment in the &lsquo;Financial Times&rsquo; which suggested that our decision to take part in the Preliminary Conference to assemble at Geneva during the month might indicate that we were prepared to agree to a tariff truce for two or three years.&rdquo;  In reference to that suggestion, it &ldquo;might indicate that we were prepared&rdquo; to do so.  I said: &ldquo;Any suggestion that the decision of Saorstát Eireann to take part in this Conference indicates a fresh orientation of the Government policy on the matter of trade barriers is very wide of the mark.&rdquo;  The Deputy says he cannot understand what that means.  I went on to enlarge on that: &ldquo;A blunt proposal to mark time on tariffs is not acceptable to us.&rdquo;  I said that our people would not be called exactly observers. Their main duty will be to watch the proceedings for my Department. I enlarged on that and said: &ldquo;The question of a tariff truce is only one of many recommendations to be discussed at the Conference. The matter which interests us most and of which we approve is the proposal for an economic rapprochement with particular reference to the question of assisting countries which are mainly agricultural and which from various causes are undeveloped industrially.&rdquo; Surely that is a perfect description of the attitude to be adopted by anyone who knows things in this country as they exist, and when he knows that that country is to be fitted into a European mould where <Col N="601" /> in Europe there is developing this very definite tendency against tariffs.  I further said: &ldquo;We anticipate that whatever results from the Preliminary Conference will be reviewed in the light of the larger recommendations of the World Economic Conference at the final Diplomatic Conference.  As Professor O'Sullivan, Minister for Education, and I pointed out at the League of Nations Conference this year, our tariffs are organised on scientific lines, or, at least, much more scientifically than the tariff systems of many other countries.  At present we are in a process of examining the whole problem and various industries have not yet been finally considered.  In these circumstances we could not agree to a state of affairs which would stereotype our tariff system in its present state of development.&rdquo;  Yet the Deputy is afraid that delegates who go over after that sort of statement are bound to commit this country to a lowering of tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>Finally he quoted again, though not in full, the statement sent to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations announcing that the delegation from this country was going to take part in the proceedings.  The terms of that are important.  &ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State are anxious to examine how they can, conformably with the principles advocated by their delegates at the last session of the Assembly, co-operate to the fullest extent with other members of the League of Nations in economic disarmament.  Accordingly, I am instructed by the Minister for External Affairs to state that my Government are prepared to appoint representatives at the proposed Tariff Truce Conference with a view to considering whether, having regard to the special conditions of countries industrially under-developed, a truce could be arranged in which the Irish Free State would find it possible to participate.&rdquo;  The Deputy, if one is to get any line of policy from him, apparently was stronger on this line, that we should not have been there at all.  We give a wrong impression <Col N="602" /> of public opinion in this country, notwithstanding the interviews I have read, and the very definite communication to the Secretary-General of the League, that we are anxious to see how far we could co-operate.  But that is limited by the words &ldquo;conformably with the principles advocated by their delegates at the last session of the Assembly.&rdquo;  Finally we said we were prepared to appoint representatives at the proposed Tariff Truce Conference with a view to considering whether, &ldquo;having regard to the special conditions of countries industrially under-developed, a truce could be arranged in which the Irish Free State would find it possible to participate.&rdquo;  I wonder has the Deputy viewed the state of Europe? Has he any idea of the varying policies there are in Europe, and that attempts are going to be made to reconcile them at this trade conference? Has he any idea that the main mover in this was the French and not the British delegation?  The main representative of the nation moving most in the matter stated that no matter what would be the outcome of this conference there would be certain industries in France that would have to be protected, and that they would have reservations in regard to these, and almost the same statement was made by all the people who confessed themselves to be in principle in favour of the lowering of the tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>At the World Economic Conference where this question was first brought up there was a model drawn up by a certain English one-time member of Parliament, showing in a particular form, the tariff barriers throughout Europe.  He had all the countries there represented.  How the particular figures he had were reduced to numbers I do not know. What his index figure was and how the scheme was laid out I do not know but on the back of this pamphlet, which was circulated around Geneva at the time the Conference sat, the countries were all given in the order of their tariff barriers.  Out of 33 countries mentioned this country stood about fifth <Col N="603" /> in the list.  The list started with the untariffed countries.  What do we find at that Conference?  The countries most definitely in favour of stereotyping the present conditions and having a tariff truce were the countries that stood at the other end of that list, the countries represented by the figures 46 and 43, whereas we were represented by the figure corresponding to 12.  Is it wise to stay away from a conference of that sort and let the whole issue go by default, to have ourselves represented as irrefragable, looked upon as people trying to stand against what is almost the unanimous European desire with regard to tariffs.</P>
    <P>We found that there are quite a number of nations who are of the same mind as our own in this matter, and even nations that have the greatest drive towards the lowering of tariffs or the stereotyping of them had also reservations and provisos with regard to many of their main industries.  Is it the proper thing to let your case go by default or to stand and make your case?  Our representatives are not going to appear before the Committee as advocating something which is apparently in contrast to the European movement at the moment.  Where the work done is getting your case pleaded through personal contact with delegates of other countries, getting people to appreciate the conditions under which your country exists and getting the European system moulded to allow for the fuller development of other countries at present not industrially developed, the Deputy cannot speak with any appreciation of the proceedings unless he has steeped himself in the proceedings of the World Economic Conference or appreciated at least the position of certain countries which said that certain terms would have to be made for these countries, and that special consideration would have to be given to the backward state of agriculture even in the main agricultural countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Now this has become an important matter.  It is worth while going into it in detail.  I spoke last night in summary on points that happened in the Assembly of this year.  The resolution on which the present Conference was founded was something, at any rate, whether for good or bad.  The presence of an Irish delegation at the last Assembly was something for good or bad.  The main resolution presented to the Assembly last year was sent to the second Commission of the League.  The Minister for Education was the Irish representative on that Commission, and when this resolution came forward he adverted to it in the following way: The resolution was then framed in different terms from what it is now. Professor O'Sullivan queried the phraseology used in the first resolution, and asked what was the relation between the two ideas as expressed in two paragraphs.  He asked &ldquo;was paragraph 5 the principal and necessary condition of paragraph 4.  In other words, would it be necessary, in order to be admitted to the Conference of Governments, for them to have undertaken to conclude an economic truce?  To his mind, the drafting as it now stood demanded this interpretation. If such were the case the speaker would presently draw his conclusions, but if, on the contrary, paragraph 4 was the most important he considered that it would be necessary to revise the drafting of the resolution.  He believed that by excluding certain Governments from a Conference called by the League of Nations the latter would be making a barrier between nations whose economic situation was good and other nations which, by reason of their economic situation, could not pledge themselves to an economic armistice. The speaker could not associate himself with any resolution which would exclude such nations, because such a resolution would not only fail to be progressive, but would be a step in the wrong direction.&rdquo; But the speaker pointed out <Col N="605" /> that his Government &ldquo;could not adhere to paragraph 6 of the resolution. The Customs Tariffs Committee of his country had, it was true, received a great number of proposals and tariff regulations and the Government would be obliged to apply the latter if the Committee gave them their approval.  Ireland could not therefore adhere to the Customs truce as the Government did not wish in such a matter to tie the hands of its successors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the only part of the discussion which took place when the motion first came before the Committee. In the end, to get the matter clarified, because there was considerable doubt as to what these two paragraphs to which Professor O'Sullivan had drawn attention meant and what was the reaction between the two of them, Professor O'Sullivan brought forward the following resolution.  He said: &ldquo;He was of opinion that the report did not sufficiently take into account the objections raised by the delegations of countries with under-developed industries.  The Committee had definitely admitted the differences in the point of view between the delegations of these countries and the others.  He drew attention to the inadequacy in the drafting of the report on pages 4, 20 and 21, and proposed that the Drafting Committee should meet to modify the text on page 4.&rdquo;  He also proposed the following amendment.  This is what I really want to draw attention to.  The amendment proposed by Professor O'Sullivan was to this effect: Following on the line of the previous paragraph, it &ldquo;Recommends that negotiations should be begun between such members of the League of Nations and non-member States as may desire to participate therein with a view to promoting, at the earliest possible date, a meeting which would be convened by the Council to frame a first collective agreement for developing and facilitating economic relations by all practicable means, and especially by lowering excessive tariffs (instead of &lsquo;Customs barriers&rsquo;) and reducing other hindrances to trade, while taking account of the provisos and <Col N="606" /> reservations necessary to meet the just demands of States which are still at an early stage of their industrial evolution, and do not wish their freedom of development to be hampered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A later paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order that the preparatory work and the negotiations themselves should be pursued on a firm basis and in an atmosphere of confidence it also recommends that States which are prepared to participate therein, other than States which are at an early stage of their industrial evolution, should agree not to increase their protective tariffs above the present level....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That formulates not merely our case but the case for a considerable number of other countries in Europe who feel themselves to be in the same position as ourselves.  An amendment which put in the phrase &ldquo;lowering excessive tariffs,&rdquo; instead of the phrase which was formerly in, &ldquo;removing Customs barriers,&rdquo; was put in at the instance of the Professor and in this proposed amendment the phrase from the World Economic Conference Report did not go against tariffs but against excessive tariffs, and when they went to recount what they meant by excessive tariffs they spoke particularly about tariffs put on for bargaining purposes between the nations in mid-Europe and tariffs more or less of the retaliation type. These were the tariffs specially aimed at, while no doubt there was an atmosphere that tariffs generally were a hindrance to international trade.  However, this resolution was proposed and we drew attention in that phrase to the situation in our country and to that in other countries. Again, this is a quotation of the World Economic Conference Report: &ldquo;The just demand of States which are still at an early stage of their industrial evolution and do not wish their freedom of development to be hampered.&rdquo;  Portion of that is again from the Economic Conference Report and it drew that whole resolution which had been distorted and warped in <Col N="607" /> the Economic Conference back to what they had before them.  That almost broke up the second Conference&mdash;the bringing forward of that resolution.</P>
    <P>In the end that resolution was sent down to the Drafting Committee and at that Committee there was a smaller number of nations represented than at the main Committee, in which all the nations represented at last year's assembly took part. In the closer association of the Committee a resolution was formulated and passed and emerged from the Committee, and that resolution is now before the people at Geneva and is being discussed as a basis for negotiation.  The agreement reached and the modifications made amounted to this: that countries that wanted to get freer development, as between limited groups of themselves, might agree to stereotyped tariff barriers as they were at the moment and so, having to sterotype them, they would get a certain atmosphere and go on to reduce them; further, that there should be a Conference called to see what kind of Customs duties should be entered into and that later, following on that, there might be negotiation between the States interested and who showed their interest by signing that tariff truce to develop in other ways freedom of trade between themselves, to cut down barriers, or to prevent economic aggression between that group.  They were to pursue negotiations leading to these things, but the big thing that was determined at the instance of the States for whom that resolution spoke&mdash;nations mainly agricultural and necessarily so, and nations mainly agricultural but not necessarily remaining so and with their industrial position necessarily backward&mdash;was that it was finally added on to what was previously agreed, that before anything was done with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the League there should be a diplomatic conference of all the States called and that whatever emerged from the previous conference would be discussed before <Col N="608" /> anything final was determined. That, to my mind, shows how Geneva works and shows the benefit of paying attention to Geneva.  It also reveals the danger of closing our eyes to Geneva, and simply remaining here at home and saying that we are going to stop at home, shut ourselves up into a pocket, have no connection with the outside world, and are going to pursue our own policy.</P>
    <P>We cannot close our eyes to what is going on in Europe, and we certainly cannot close our eyes to a movement which has such force and power behind it, and which, to anyone acquainted with the situation in Central Europe, is so necessary for this scheme in regard to tariff barriers. How are we to negotiate trade treaties with foreign countries?  Are we going to remain at home, simply saying that we are determined on economic development inside the country and that we are indifferent to what happens outside?  Are we going to get our position made clear and have our position met with a more sympathetic response when we come to negotiate trade treaties with other countries who are interested in the dropping of trade barriers to the development of trade more freely between nations?  Will we get ourselves better understood by staying here and adopting a sulky attitude, saying that we do not care what happens, or by playing our part in negotiations and seeing if we can negotiate commercial treaties?  I think it should be clear to anyone who studies trade reports that if it was only for the preservation of the trade of one firm in the country, the Ford firm in Cork, it is necessary that we should negotiate in this way.</P>
    <P>We have a tariff policy here, a tariff policy that, owing to the incidence of burdens it may put on the consuming population and owing to the fact that that consuming population is much too poor at the moment, has to be spaced out year by year, but is a progressive tariff policy.  It is a tariff policy that is going to progress until every industry that likes to make application has that application adjudged by the Tariff <Col N="609" /> Commission, or is an item to be taken out to be treated specially apart from the Tariff Commission, as were the sugar beet and some other matters. That is our situation at home.  Can we say that we will pay attention only to the home market and let everything else go?  We can close down Fords and try to get the 5,000 workers employed there employed elsewhere.  Remember that that particular concern depends almost entirely on its export trade, and gives occupation at the moment to one-third as many men as all the tariffs we have put on have brought into extra employment.  It is no light thing to come to a decision which might mean the disappearance of Fords and the employment they give in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the country which does most business with Fords is a member of the League of Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to take Fords business, from the suggestions they make to me with regard to trade treaties, they do business with pretty well every country in Europe.  That is the situation, at any rate, that presents itself.  I think the only policy is to explain the point of view.  It is not necessarily because we have a certain tariff policy and because there is a drive against tariff policies in Europe that we should allow ourselves to be boycotted and become a pariah amongst European nations. We might easily be that if we took up the peculiar attitude of staying at home because we might be afraid of what our delegates might do at such conferences.  Delegates going to these conferences have very definite instructions of what they should do. Delegates, particularly Departmental delegates, pursue a policy which is dictated to them by Government policy.  There is no justification for anybody having any suspicion that people whom we send out at this stage of the country's development, and particularly sent out by a Government which has tariffed one-third of its imports, and more than <Col N="610" /> fifty per cent. of the tariffable imports of this country, will take any steps that would mean a reversal of engine from that particular point of view and impede the development of industry in the country itself.  In the end, that resolution went, as I say, to the Assembly in this form and was passed by the Assembly, that there is to be an invitation to certain States soon as to whether they desire to participate in the Diplomatic Conference or not. Then a conference is to be convened and from that there will emerge negotiations to initiate a truce and, if and when a truce is called, a final Diplomatic Conference will be held. Is it unlikely or is it impossible that there would emerge from Geneva at this point such proposals for a Customs Truce that we, being a tariff Government, could not entertain? If I take the varying opinions that were expressed at Geneva, when the motion was being proposed there, it seems to me that there are going to be many provisos, and that if it is going to be made rigid, a small number of States will take part.</P>
      <P>Deputies who follow the Press of other countries will realise that there is hardly a country represented at that Conference in which there has not been a movement of a pro-tariff type.  Immediately on the bringing forward of this resolution with regard to the breaking down of tariff barriers, France had many conferences, for instance, of businessmen and industrialists at which French representatives were warned not to entertain proposals of a tariff truce of a rigid type for two years. Britain has had them and other countries through Europe have had them, even the countries most forward in proposing a tariff truce, with the exception of Belgium and Czecho-Slovakia.  While there is a big volume of public opinion not objecting to delegates going to conferences such as this, the idea is that the delegates should be instructed that many of their industries call for continued protection and that they would have no interference with these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> I look forward with interest to see what emerges from the Conference and to see what will be the exact terms of the proposed truce, whether it is rigid or whether there will be a number of reservations by the nations who will sign the Customs Truce for two years.  Even if a number of nations do that our policy would be determined by ourselves, but it will have to be determined with some appreciation of the problems of other countries and how far our trade will inter-act with these problems.  After we come to a decision, the final Diplomatic Conference has to meet.  If I were to quote the points I made at the Assembly this year in connection with this matter it might be of interest to Deputies:</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have little quarrel with that Report or with the excellent statements on economic matters made here by the statesmen of the greatest countries in Europe.  But we are anxious that the economic organisations should move forward to action, so that from their approach to and handling of concrete cases, we may understand their method of discriminating between the industrially advanced and the industrially backward countries, and observe if a difference is recognised, and marked in subsequent recommendations, between bargaining, retaliatory and purely protective tariffs.  We are anxious to see, what practice alone may show, if the only aim is to secure the removal of those artificial props which are said to bolster up industries in countries unsuited to them, without some investigation first of all being made to discover what other industries are fitted to take their place.  We should be slow to think that the assumption will be acted upon that there is none such, and that some countries will be compelled more and more to rely on agriculture, the present depressed state of which is deplored without any effective remedy being suggested <Col N="612" /> or even sought.  And if the protective tariff as a weapon of defence is going to be taken away or even limited in use, it will be of vital importance to know how the League on its economic side will react to the various means by which nations promote economic aggression&mdash;the system of bounties, the manipulation of shipping freights, the organisation of international cartels, the control of capital and the provision or denial of credit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is the question of the free movement of peoples as a necessary corollary to allowing industry and commerce to follow their own course.  That is the case that we made at various committees of the League itself and those are the main ideas put forward as representing this country.  That was what was referred to in the letter to the Secretary-General of the League when we announced that we were sending delegates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of the Irish Free State are anxious to examine how they can, conformably with the principles advocated by their delegates at the last session of the Assembly, co-operate to the fullest extent with other members of the League of Nations in economic disarmament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anybody fail to understand what is meant by that?  Can anybody take out of it that we are going to agree to a rigid proposal, that as from 1st October last no further tariffs shall be put in force in this country, and that any tariffs we have should have their amounts raised or that they should be modified in any way?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, I am instructed by the Minister for External Affairs to say that my Government are prepared to appoint representatives at the proposed Tariff Truce Conference with a view to considering whether, having regard to the special conditions of countries industrially underdeveloped, a truce could be arranged in which the Irish Free <Col N="613" /> State would find it possible to participate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there was any doubt in regard to the attitude before, but that doubt could not have existed if people followed even what the Press gave of the discussions and the reports of speeches made at Geneva last September or October. Is there any doubt now, either as to the trend of public opinion as understood by the Government or in regard to Government action at the Conference?  Is there a better appreciation now of the delicate situation there is in a country which has not industrial development as far forward as it should be, where protective measures are being put into force and are to continue to operate, but, nevertheless, a country which has an export trade of some value, and where that export trade has to be safeguarded against venomous or retaliatory tactics of other nations who would certainly construe our absence from the Conference in a particular way?  If we stayed away from the Conference we would be the only European State not taking part with the exception of Albania.  Is it believed by the Opposition that, except Albania, all the nations of Europe are in favour of lowering tariff barriers, or are in favour of a tariff truce for two years?  If they do believe that, do they believe that we would be wise to stay away and to let our case go by default?  Should we not enter into the Conference, listen to the details of the proposals, and after listening and learning what modifications could be made to make it more acceptable to our point of view, and after giving our reasons, either accept the tariff truce or abandon it?</P>
    <P>I have gone into some details because this is the most important matter that has been raised on this whole discussion.  I would like to get other oportunities of discussing what has been done by the Department of External Affairs or by its representatives. We will get an opportunity later of two special items. Complaint has been made that the Department never gives reports out on its own initiative.  That complaint <Col N="614" /> comes from the same Deputy who also complained last year that reports were not issued and who was not aware that the reports about which he was complaining were in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister again attempting to create the same false impression which he created last year when he stated that reports were in the Library which were not Tabled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy complained that there was no information given.  If he took any pains at all he would know. He simply went to see had reports been Tabled and did not inquire in the Library for them.  On another occasion he sent a follower into the Library who brought back inaccurate information. He brought back a report dealing with the year 1923 and gave it as a report for 1925, although the printer's mark showed that it was for 1923.  The Library is for the information of Deputies and the reports were there and all the Deputy had to do was to ask for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words they were slipped surreptitiously into the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Slipped surreptitiously is properly applied if the Deputy means that there was no sort of torchlight procession and that there was no parade, no clash of cymbals, when they were put there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to an order concerning shellfish layings in the counties of Louth and Meath?  That order is being laid upon the Table and it is now in the Library.  Information as to that fact is on the Order Paper to-day.  Surely if a matter such as shellfish layings is considered sufficiently important to be notified in that way to Deputies, some similar notification ought to be given concerning the highly-important matter of the action of the delegates to the League of Nations. It certainly is at least as important as an order concerning shellfish <Col N="615" /> layings and I think Deputies should be notified in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I am not saying that they should not, but what I want to call attention to is that last year the Deputy indicated that he had not certain information when, in fact, that information was at his hand.  The complaint is made this year that we had not supplied reports.  I have promised to give reports to Deputies and I have promised that reports relating to the actions of delegates to the League of Nations Assembly and to the International Labour Conference would be left in the Library, would be sent to Deputies or would be laid upon the Table&mdash;whatever the appropriate form would be.  Those reports are not going to be surreptitiously put anywhere.  I do not know what else the Deputy wants, or if there is any particular desire of his that is not fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister another example.  A communication to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations concerning the Tariff Truce was in part published in the &ldquo;Irish Independent.&rdquo; It was never laid upon the Table of the Dáil nor was it communicated to Deputies.  Are we to take it that such documents of that kind are always to be communicated to the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and not to Deputies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There may be occasions when it is in the public interest to communicate those matters to the Press and there are times when the papers require it; but the appropriate time both for this discussion and for the public announcement of the terms on which the invitation was accepted would come when the report of these delegates is issued and when the result of the Conference is being announced to Deputies in the House.  I think that Deputy Lemass is always too eager to get material for the next Sunday's meeting and, consequently, I assume he had to jump in on this. <Col N="616" /> Deputies were too ready to rush to the conclusion that because we decided to attend the Conference we were about to tear up the whole tariff system of the country.  But it was essential that Deputy Lemass should have material for the next Sunday's debate, and so we had this rush in and all the suspicion and hostility excited about people going to the Conference.  Surely if the Deputy had any earnest desire for this information he could have asked what were the terms upon which our delegates went to the Conference.  It was wise, however, not to seek the information until he got the Sunday meeting over.  There is always an appropriate time for these things to be presented to the House and to be placed in the Library.  The time would be most appropriate when the report of the Conference has been received and when the results achieved are before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is again making a fine point as between laying the information on the Table and placing the material in the Library.  I might say that there is an amount of information in the Library which would greatly enlighten the Deputy if he would but sit there and study instead of merely going round to meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know whether reports are available from the commercial representatives of <Col N="617" /> the Free State in other countries. Have the representatives who are referred to in this Vote charge of the commercial business of the Free State in other countries?  In what way can Deputies gain access to such reports as will enlighten them on the labours of these gentlemen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking last year on the Vote I said, with regard to the offices generally, that there is no great difference between the commercial and the other offices except that a great deal more information can be given than on the other side, much of which is confidential.  I said I would have to arrange time for the commercial representatives. Deputies will understand that there has been a big reorganisation of all the offices.  Part of it is completed and part is still to come.  The full year has not yet elapsed and I have promised that I will have all these reports, but it will take time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the trade representative in New York a sufficiently long time there to enable the Department to produce some kind of report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He can produce reports extending over a period of years, but I do not consider that is of great value at the moment.  I said before that we would proceed in yearly steps and have reports from time to time.  As the Deputy is aware, there has been a change in the New York office and necessarily it takes time for a man to settle down.  Questions were raised on this Vote and it looked as if there was some information that Deputies felt was being withheld from them. I would like to know if there is anything of that nature that I could now attend to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite satisfied if we could be certain that the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; is the recognised official channel for communicating information to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say on that point that the Deputy had no <Col N="618" /> hesitation in quoting as an authoritative statement what the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that I was correct in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that he was, as usual, blundering. It was quite wrong.  If there is any information published with official sanction or any information resulting from an interview with me, the Deputy may take that as authoritative, and if he sees anything in the paper which purports to be a statement of what was in a document he may take that as authoritative; but he must not take all the rumours written around by a political correspondent, in a manner similar to what is done by political correspondents in every country in the world, as authoritative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that certain reports had been published in various papers and he told us yesterday that we ought to have read those papers in the ordinary course so that we might be informed.  To-day he finds fault with Deputies using information which they have got in the newspapers. At least the Minister should have the same state of mind on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not complained. I am only stating that Deputy Lemass quoted from the political correspondent of the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo; I think it was quite wrong for him to have done that. He made a statement based on what was written by the political correspondent. It is a different matter when there is an authoritative statement made by the Minister to the same political correspondent or if there are quotations from an official document handed to the political correspondent.  I do not at all object to the papers being taken as the ordinary medium for information in the country, but I do object to a statement made on the authority of a political correspondent and to quotations being made from that <Col N="619" /> statement as against the authoritative statements made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used the League of Nations Report issued two days ago.  I understood we were not going to discuss the League of Nations on this matter.  I would remind the Minister that the Minister for Education in a lecture on the League of Nations stated specifically that the Free State were not going to the Tariff Conference.  The Minister now goes to great length telling us why they are going to the Conference.  The Minister for Education said they were not going to the Tariff Truce Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I read the statement in the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; which contained a report of the Minister's speech.  Does the Minister now find fault with that?  I am quite certain that the Minister for Education stated particularly that they were not going to send delegates to the Tariff Truce Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Education has said that we were not going into a tariff truce, surely it seems to be a stupid piece of conduct to go into a conference about a tariff truce to which you are not going to agree.  In view of the speech which the Minister for External Affairs has made disposing of the possibility of any truce being arrived at in the matter of tariffs, <Col N="620" /> why waste time by going to the Conference at all?</P>

      <P>There is no good in talking to the Deputy or of explaining a matter to him.  The Deputy is still, after my very detailed explanation, under a wrong impression and I find I have failed absolutely to make any impression upon him, or to convince him by the facts I have placed before him.</P>

What I want to know now is&mdash;is there any information which Deputy Lemass wants at the moment and which he thinks is in my possession and which he thinks ought to be produced but which has not been produced with regard to this Tariff Truce Conference, or is there any matter concerned <Col N="621" /> with this Estimate on which he requires further information?</P>

In that way, we could make our aims clearer than by sitting at home and saying that we are not in favour of tariffs and that we will build up tariff barriers here to any height.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £120 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1930, chun Deontas i gCabhair do Chostaisí Chumann na Náisiún, agus chun Costaisí eile mar gheall air sin.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £120 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for a Grant-in-Aid of the expenses of the League of Nations, and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>The extra amount asked for at the moment is necessitated by the fact that a bigger delegation was sent to Geneva than had previously been thought necessary, and more particularly by the fact that the attempt to get hotel accommodation was made too late.  The result was that the delegation had to put up in a hotel some four miles outside the city with consequent extra travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If it would not be anticipating a more formal debate, I think the Minister might tell us what are the hopes from the latest conference of the League of Nations with regard to the principal work which the League was intended to do.  It seems from a rather hasty reading of the Minister's speech that he was rather sceptical about the progress that was being made towards that end.  For instance, in the first paragraph of his speech there is this statement:</P>
      <P>Progress in the Preparatory Commission's work has, unfortunately, not so far been favourable to the calling of the Conference. Although some important decisions have been reached, practically the only result that is claimed for the activities of the Commission since last year is an improved atmosphere in the discussions. This result is, of course, to the good; but I think that in the eleventh year after the world war, and a year after the signing of the Kellogg Pact, some more definite result might have been expected.</P>
      <P>Later on we find the following in the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>But we feel that if these words and professions, however sincere, are not followed up by appropriate action, first they will lose their effectiveness, and, eventually, will become harmful, as conveying to the public interested in these matters that words and actions have here no bond, that statements are not seriously meant, or that the League is so ineffective that even in one of the principal tasks laid upon it by the Covenant, it can and ought to be ignored.</P>
      <P>It is evident the Minister felt that previous Conferences did not lead substantially to the goal towards which the League was directed from the first and that progress has not been made towards the fulfilment of the principal object of the foundation of the League.  At the same time the Minister was making that statement the special correspondent of the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; was writing in that paper to this effect:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What does matter is that Lord Cecil has exposed the insincerity of the majority of Governments in this <Col N="629" /> matter of disarmament and the worse than futile methods of the Preparatory Disarmament Commission, who, as Lord Cecil said, are offering not bread but a stone to a world hungry for pence.  This has not been a pleasant morning.  Far from it.  This revelation of the attitude of so many members of the League towards what Count Bernstorff rightly said this morning was the chief question with which the League had to deal does not encourage the facile optimism of those who put their confidence in Mr. Briand's pacific rhetoric.  But it is far better that the public opinion of the world should realise that the League has as yet done nothing at all to achieve the chief purpose for which it was founded and that the majority of its members are determined that it shall do nothing if they can help it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In face of statements like that, if the occasion seems appropriate to the Minister, we should have some statement from him as to whether the result of the last Conference indicated that any further progress had been made.  I think everybody interested in public questions is interested in the League from that point of view, as to whether it will fulfil the purpose for which it was founded, whether it will bring about disarmament, and create a condition where world peace must be maintained. If the League is not going forward in that direction, if it is merely passing resolutions which are afterwards not confirmed by the Parliaments from which the delegates are sent, or are only confirmed, as the Minister himself remarked, with reservations that more or less destroy their value, it will be an unfortunate thing.  In such case very many people would inevitably come to look upon the League just as an international association where perhaps pleasant and interesting conferences take place but where nothing of any great importance to the world occurs.  None of us wants to hear a message of that kind, but, at the same time, if it is true that there are certain powers, certain big influences in the League, who are not only content <Col N="630" /> that nothing has been done to achieve the purpose for which the League was founded but are determined that nothing shall be done if they can help it, if that is the state of things, we are entitled to know&mdash; for I suppose we are able to bear such news&mdash;what we are voting the money for when we are passing a Vote like this which has to be paid by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Moore that it is regrettable the Minister, in introducing the estimate, has not made some statement as to the fruits of the labours of the Free State delegates to the League of Nations.  The Minister is no doubt interested in this question and both himself and his colleague, the Minister for Education, have stressed the fact that the Assemblies of the League of Nations have done a good deal to create an international atmosphere and an international understanding.  The Minister for Education in an address on this subject mentioned that the League of Nations Assembly was very useful for clearing up matters. What precisely the matters were that were cleared up we would like to have some information upon. The House will remember that when the League of Nations was originally formed, and even up to the present time, the United States of America refused to participate. That was chiefly because of an agitation which was got up in the United States of America by the Irish section in opposition to Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which guaranteed the territorial integrity of the constituent members of the League against interference by other members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seemed to supporters of Irish aspirations for freedom that by America entering the League of Nations she was giving cognisance to, and acquiescing in, the English claim that British Imperial affairs as such should not come within the jurisdiction of that body; that the British Empire acted there as a unit, and that no matters connected with the internal affairs of any part of the <Col N="631" /> British Dominions and British Empire should come within the jurisdiction of the Court.  The Minister for External Affairs on some occasions in this House treats us to elaborate expositions of the advances that we have made in the Imperial Conference.  We have made great strides towards freedom, and we are constantly waking up to find ourselves even freer than we were before, the only limit being put upon our ultimate freedom in that connection being that we shall be free as long as we are not free.  So long as we do not seek to be really free, then we are as free as we like.  The Minister can, no doubt, explain that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case the Ministry have one philosophy with regard to the British Empire and the affairs of the British Imperial Conference and, on the other hand, they tried to get us to support them in their contention that membership of the League of Nations constitutes an acceptance by the other States in that League of the Irish Free State as a full national entity, having full sovereign independence, and having all the attributes of separate nationhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the Covenant of the League of Nations, which in that Article X guarantees the territorial integrity of the British Empire and of all its parts, and therefore makes it impossible for the Free State to seek assistance in any dispute that may arise within them, or any other constituents of the British Empire, you have the recent position created by the so-called optional clause, where you had the British representative signing that clause with a distinct reservation that they would only agree to the jurisdiction that is implied in that clause and only subscribe to it on the condition that they would be allowed to put their own interpretation upon it.  So that <Col N="632" /> in the inception of the League of Nations and in its latest manifestation, where so many nations signed this optional clause, the British Empire, or England as the headpiece of the Empire, has twice affirmed the position that a dispute within the Empire will not be open to the jurisdiction of the League of Nations or of the International Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Our membership of the League of Nations is ratified by an Act of the Oireachtas and this particular estimate is not even the main estimate for the year. It is a supplementary estimate dealing with travelling and incidental expenses.  Deputy Moore raised the question as to our attendance at the assembly and particular matters which arose out of that assembly. That, of course, is completely relevant. But the fundamental question as to whether or not we ought to be a member of the League of Nations is completely outside the scope of this estimate&mdash;indeed, it seems to me, of any estimate, as it is a matter for legislation.  The Deputy in his allusion to the Minister for Education and the Minister for External Affairs at last year's assembly was quite within the scope of the estimate, because the expenses for that are included in the estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it I am precluded from following the line I had undertaken.  I want to say in conclusion that the Minister for Education stated, and I am sure we were all glad to see the statement, that in their efforts to advance Ireland's cause, or that portion of Ireland called the Free State, at the League of Nations, the Free State delegation were prompted by a sincere desire not to impede in any way the work of any successors they might have.  They wanted to leave them quite free and not to impose any obligations upon them.  It seems to me that by participating in the Conference under the condition in which it is at present, and under the regulations and restrictions which bind it, the Ministry, whether they like it or not, are binding the Free State and any future Government, so far as it is possible for them to do so.</P>

      <P>The extra amount required under this Vote is made up first of all under Sub-head B., &ldquo;New Works, Alterations and Additions,&rdquo; which accounts for £28,000.  As the estimate has to be made about fifteen months in advance, the figure of estimated expenditure is only an approximate one.  It is subject to many varying factors; for example, consultations have to be held with the various Departments interested, plans have to be prepared, specifications and quantities where necessary made out, the capacity of the contractor and the weather conditions taken into account.  All these varying factors account oftentimes for variations in the amount of the estimate.  In this particular case these factors were favourable and as a result of that we over-expended the Vote.  The second item is made up <Col N="636" /> under sub-head B.B.1.  That amount, £1,600, is for the transference of a very interesting archæological monument, St. Molua's Oratory, which would have been completely submerged as a result of the flooding under the Shannon scheme were it not removed.  Very strong representations were made to the Government that this work should be undertaken, and accordingly it was done at a cost of £1,600.</P>
      <P>The next item, B.B.2, is a result of the adaptation and renovation of the new residence for the Papal Nuncio.  Rather heavy expenditure had to be incurred in this case for the laying of electrical cables.  A chapel had to be built, furniture had to be procured and generally pretty extensive repairs had to be undertaken in the residence.  There is also an item under Sub-head E. for rents.  As a result of not leaving a sufficient margin we found that rents amounted to £2,000 more this year than we had anticipated. This additional expense is set off by Appropriations-in-Aid to the extent of £6,670 and also by anticipated savings under other sub-heads amounting to £19,000, leaving a net total of £9,130.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £7,950 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc.; and for other purposes connected with Irish transport.</P>
    <P>There are two items in this.  One is in respect of the acquisition of land for colliery railways.  The additional sum required is £2,200. For years past we included an item of £1,000 introduced always in the nature of a token Vote because there can be no finality with regard to it.  The schemes had been all brought before the solicitors concerned and the bills of costs finally scaled.  These colliery railways have been absorbed into the undertaking of the Great Southern Railways as from 1st January, 1929, but it was on the condition that all out-standing claims would be liquidated by the Government.  It is estimated that this amount now asked for will end all this long drawn out litigation with regard to the title of the land which really was compulsorily acquired for the purposes of these areas, but there are still outstanding a few minor claims, and I propose to include a token Vote in connection with small outstanding items which will come to be provided.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other item, it is usually a sum which varies according to the amount necessary to be advanced to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway service working two or three small lines in County Donegal.  The sum which we are recommending as payment to this line is £5,750.  I think it will be noticed that £2,500 has been advanced from the Contingency Fund in respect of <Col N="641" /> this sum, and a repayment of that Vote must be paid.  The amounts paid since 1924 run in the following way: in 1924 there was paid £7,240; in 1925 and 1926 there was £7,000 paid in each of these years; in 1927 there was £6,000, and in 1928 £5,600. This year, unfortunately, marks an increase, and it is to meet that that we introduce this.  This is on the understanding that the Northern Government foots a bill of a similar amount.  The whole working of the line and the whole expenditure has been under careful inspection.  The expenditure for the last year as compared with the year before shows a decrease of £5,000.  Nevertheless traffic has fallen off, mainly due to the operation of road competition, and this amount is absolutely essential if railway communications are to be maintained in the Donegal district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it essential that this railway should be maintained?  It appears to me that we spend a considerable sum of money each year in maintaining it.  From what the Minister said it would appear that that sum is not going to be less in the future.  I would be glad if the Minister and his Department would consider whether it is essential under modern conditions that this railway and its expenditure should be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to oppose this Vote, but there are some points I wish to raise in order that the Minister would clarify them.  I notice when this estimate was first circulated to the House a few months ago the sum the House was then asked to vote was £3,750. That estimate was printed in the month of October last.  There was circulated either yesterday or to-day a revised estimate in which that sum has now been increased by £2,000. It now reaches the figure £5,750.  I notice the Minister was very silent with regard to the question as to why it was increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the procedure which the Minister's Department adopts is to send their auditors to examine the books of the Londonderry and <Col N="642" /> Lough Swilly Railway.  If they sent their auditors in October last to examine the books of the company, how was it that the auditors reported that a sum of £3,750 would be necessary?  Now we find the Minister altering that estimate and increasing it by £2,000.  The Minister had told us that it has been the practice of the Six-County Government in previous years to vote a similar sum to that which was voted in this House.  I understand that in the Six-County Parliament that they have already voted a sum of £3,500 this financial year.  Does that mean that we are asked to contribute £2,000 more than the Six-County Government to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, or am I to take it that it is the intention of the Six-County Government to contribute a further £2,000?  I would like to direct the attention of the Minister to another point.  He will probably recollect that during the time the railway estimates were under discussion in this House on the 26th June I directed the attention of the Minister to certain notices that had been given by a number of railway companies to three railway trade unions notifying these trade unions that it was their intention to withdraw from the negotiating machinery in connection with railways.  One of the companies which notified their intention to withdraw on the 11th April next is the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.  It is not my intention to go into detail with regard to this negotiating machinery, but suffice it to say that this negotiating machinery deals with the question of wages and conditions of the employees.  Some of the companies after having given notice to the railway trade unions that it was their intention to withdraw, after having negotiations with the railway trade unions modified their proposals. They are briefly that the railway trade unions should agree to scrap the Inter-Departmental Committee, the Railway Councils, the Central Wages Board and should agree to certain alterations in the personnel of the Sectional Council and a certain <Col N="643" /> change in the personnel of the Irish Wages Board.  In effect some of these proposals are tantamount to making the machinery farcical.</P>
    <P>When I raised this in June last the Minister replied saying the notices of the company would not expire until April next, and that he would look into the matter.  I would like him to let us know what his intention is with regard to the action these companies have taken.  I may say that if the companies persist in the attitude they have adopted it is going to create industrial unrest on the railways.</P>

Speaking with regard to the action of these Companies, one of which was the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, on last Saturday at the annual meeting of the Irish divisional council of the R.C.A., Senator O'Farrell said that the relationship between the railway companies, and amongst those he included the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>He included it.</P>
      <P>The relationships between the railway companies and the unions, he said, had now become even more confused than before.  At first four companies had notified their withdrawal from the machinery. Negotiations had taken place between them and the union, and it looked as if a settlement was likely, but now they found that the four companies had split, two being in favour of a certain policy and two against, so that the present position was that there was no recognised authority to speak for the four companies.  In two months the notices would expire and then a serious position would have arisen.  Until this and other matters were settled there was going to be no real progress on the railway, and railwaymen could not settle down to their work until they had some guarantee of security and some protection against injustice.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention that one of the reasons why this House has to vote a certain amount every year for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway is owing to the bus traffic&mdash;I might say the unfair bus traffic&mdash;which takes place in County Donegal.  I believe the Minister's Department has a certain responsibility which it has not shouldered in this matter.  Buses are operating in County Donegal against the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, which are owned by companies in the Six Counties where the buses are registered.  These buses use and abuse the roads of County Donegal to compete against the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway.</P>

The facts are that as far as Donegal is concerned buses come there from the Six Counties, use and abuse the roads, but pay taxation within the Six Counties which goes to the British Exchequer.  Not one halfpenny goes towards the upkeep of the roads in Donegal.  I raised this question before, and the Minister stated it was a question of reciprocal arrangement.  I do not think that goes down too well, inasmuch as some bus companies registered in Belfast and plying for hire in Donegal, run exclusively between one village and another in Donegal, and do not go into the Six Counties. That is a matter the Minister might take into consideration.  I believe if he did there would not be the same necessity for the sum that the House is now asked to vote.  I believe that one of the reasons why the Dáil is asked to vote this money, to subsidise the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company, is that as far as railway companies which cross the Border are concerned, the Minister's Department seems to have no policy. Railways operating exclusively within the Saorstát have been amalgamated, but for railways crossing the Border the Minister's Department had not, and I believe has not yet, any policy.  Deputies will remember that when the Treaty was signed certain provision was made for what was known as the setting up of an Irish Council.  One of the functions which the Irish Council would have to deal with was the question of railways.  But the Minister or the Executive Council saw their way in 1925 to agree to the scrapping of the Irish Council, with the result that they have no policy at present regarding railways crossing the Border.</P>

    <P>There is another point I would like the Minister to deal with when replying.  Has he any information to give the House as to any negotiations which have recently taken <Col N="646" /> place as to the amalgamation or absorption of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway by any other company?  I understand negotiations have taken place.  Probably the Minister will let us know whether his Department has been consulted if the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway is to be taken over by any other companies.  Personally I will vote for the Estimate, as I do not agree with Deputy Good's statement.  I believe it is necessary that this railway should be kept open in the interests of the farmers, the traders, and the travelling public in Co. Donegal, as well as in the interests of the employees.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cassidy dealt with a variety of matters that I do not want to go into.  Whatever small points were relevant to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company they have very little relevance to the exact matters dealt with in this Vote.  A revision of £2,000 has been made because of the full appreciation of the losses.  We have the actual accounts showing the ascertained losses on the line, and how far expenditure exceeded gross receipts.  Anything we pay is on a fifty-fifty basis with the Northern Government.  The Deputy said that it was peculiar that in the month of October an estimate was sent round which he alleges was founded on an auditor's report made some time earlier.  That is quite so.  It is quite easy to see that at that time there were all sorts of plans in regard to railway working in Donegal.  I thought we would not foot any bill at that time higher than the original sum of £3,750.  Later on it became apparent to us, in the interests of keeping railway communication open in Donegal, that the additional fifty per cent. of the loss had to be paid.  That is without prejudice to the question of whether or not it is essential to keep railway communication as such open in Donegal.  The question of the machinery of the Wages Board is a matter I will discuss hereafter on the main Vote.  It has very little reference to this.  At the moment all I am concerned with is, apart from the machinery for disputes, <Col N="647" /> by virtue of keeping the lines in order, that a certain amount of railway work should be done until other plans for the preservation of transport in Donegal are a little more forward than at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss such a big item on a Supplementary Estimate for the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway which, as the Deputy announced, is registered outside the area of the Free State.  If it seems to be an urgent matter it can be raised by notice by the Deputy or in various ways.  It is not a proper matter to drag into this Estimate.  I put it to him that he will get no satisfactory answer to the question raised by this particular motion.  As to absorption or amalgamation, there have been various suggestions as to what ought to be done by this Railway.  Suggestions were made in regard to an amalgamation process.  The difficulty there is what headline there would be for amalgamation.  Whatever negotiations were going on have ended in nothing, and any proposal that is being considered is on the lines referred to by Deputy Good, namely, how far can transport in Donegal be maintained by the railway mainly, plus some bus service, or by buses mainly, plus some traffic services on the railway, or by some intermediate stage as between bus and railway.  There is no doubt that the prospects in regard to the railways in Donegal are far from bright. Receipts have fallen since the year 1924, when they amounted to £62,000, to £60,000, £54,000, £52,000, £51,000, and this year to £44,000 roughly.  All that time expenditure has also been dropping, but nothing like in proportion to the dropping receipts.  Expenditure <Col N="648" /> has dropped from £71,000 in 1924 to £70,000, £67,000, £63,000, £59,000, and this year roughly to £52,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must give me time to examine the figures. I would prefer not to go into the question of the buses which are running at present.  There is a prospect of the railway receipts decreasing. There is a continuous decrease, an extraordinary decrease, and it cannot be said in answer that expenditure has been out of the ordinary. It has been reduced year by year and we are not without hopes that further reduction in expenditure may take place but we have little prospect of meeting such expenditure as the railways are at present operated.  In that situation what has to be done is a very serious matter. It may be that traffic in that part of Donegal ought to be operated by bus.  It may be that the company in amalgamating with the bus services may be able to meet expenses or that they, or some other company, might have to run on a different basis, but at the moment if we want to keep railway communication going until the question can be settled we will have to foot this Bill.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £10 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1930, chun Costas an Airm, maraon le Cúl taca an Airm.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1930, for the cost of the Army including Army Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen that the sum is one of only £10.  It is merely a token Vote, because it does not add any further sum of money to that already voted on the original Estimate, and this expense will be met out of moneys therein voted.  Certain sub-heads are exceeded and new ones are created, so that it is necessary to bring them before the Dáil. If you extract the first and third items the other four arise out of the creation of the Volunteer Reserve and the O.T.C. units.  The first item arises out of the general re-organisation of the Army, in which, as we have decreased in size, certain N.C.O.s and other men become supernumerary, and it is proposed to give them small gratuities.  Item No. 3&mdash;&ldquo;Animals and Forage&rdquo;&mdash; comes from the fact that last year it was made clear to us, particularly as we are a horse-breeding country, that it was necessary that our jumping team should appear at a number of foreign shows.  That necessitated an increase in the general equipment for animals, etc., and that is the reason for the token Vote.  The clothing and equipment is for the Volunteer Reserve and the O.T.C. The item of general stores also is due to the creation of the Volunteer Reserve and the O.T.C.  The same <Col N="650" /> reason applies to barrack maintenance, and incidental expenses also arise out of the creation of the Volunteer Reserve and O.T.C.  As I have already explained, this is not adding to the amount voted in the original Estimate last year.  The Estimate at that time did not include either the Volunteer Reserve or the O.T.C., for the reason that I was not in a position of being certain that we would advance to the stage of getting these organisations when the Estimate was being prepared. I take this opportunity of saying that I frequently referred here to the proposed creation of those bodies.  Judging from the discussions that took place on those occasions, the proposal quite naturally met with the approval of the Dáil.  I say &ldquo;quite naturally,&rdquo; because I think that the creation of the Volunteer Reserve and the O.T.C. is one of the most hopeful signs of the times.  These bodies have no relation to party politics.  They are recruited from young men belonging, if they like, to any party or to no party, and they come forward to give service to their country.</P>
    <P>The response which we have had from those bodies has very far exceeded anything that I expected, and I regard that response as one of the finest signs of what I might call a return to normality in this country, where people tend to think more of the State as a whole than of their own individual political or other opinions.  To me it is very gratifying to see the way that these young men have come forward for those organisations.  For the sake of charity I may explain again that items Nos. 1 and 3 are not associated with the Volunteer Reserve or O.T.C. and that all the other items directly arise out of the creation of those bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly glad to observe that the taxpayers of this country will not be called on to give any substantial increase in the sum already estimated for the Army. The sum of £1,600,000 which has been estimated, apart from military service and wound pensions, is quite <Col N="651" /> sufficient for this country to spend on its Army.  There is an item for gratuities, gratuities for N.C.O.'s and men.  I suppose that as there has been some saving in gratuities paid to officers we might put in an additional estimate for gratuities to men.  The whole gratuity payments have excited great criticism in the country.  It is well-known that some of the men who got gratuities in the Army got as much on retirement after a couple of years' service as they would have earned in forty years in their previous occupation.</P>

      <P>The peace-makers are going to be the greatest troublemakers so far as I can see.  I do not know what reason the Minister has to be delighted at the measure of success which he says has attended the establishment of the Volunteer <Col N="652" /> Reserve.  I see an item of £10 for advertising.  The Minister must be getting his advertisements at very special rates if they cost only £10 in connection with the Volunteer Reserve. I would like him to explain that item.  I think it is pretty obvious to anyone that the Minister for Defence must have spent several thousands, if not tens of thousands, of pounds in organising the O.T.C. and the Volunteer Reserve, but the only result that attended those activities has been the coming forward of 300 men for the Volunteer Reserve in Dublin and another couple of hundred between the two O.T.C. units.  To my mind, it is an indication that the people do not trust the Minister when only 300 young men have come forward in spite of all sorts of inducements to join the Volunteer Reserve.  Only 300 ordinary people in Dublin have come forward.  The Minister stated yesterday that 82 men came forward in Trinity College, and he said that they came forward solely in order to render service to Ireland.  I know that there are some men who might be expected to come forward from Trinity College and to join the Army solely to give service to Ireland, but I believe that the larger portion of those who came forward from Trinity College did so in order to get trained to give service to England. I think it is a sheer waste of public money to spend it on training an O.T.C. in Trinity College.  I do not think that the people of the country approve of it, and certainly we on these benches do not.</P>

      <P>The fighting mentality disclosed in the speeches which we heard yesterday from the Minister for Defence and to-day from the prospective Minister for Defence on behalf of the two big parties, is a very unfortunate mentality for those who have to put up with it from day to day.  From platforms in the country and from benches here, we repeatedly hear about the type of Army which this country would require to defend itself from people&mdash;I do not know who they are&mdash;who are going to <Col N="653" /> attack this country.  The Minister for Defence, who made a fighting and rather provocative speech, is represented at the Naval Disarmament Conference in London by a delegate whose duty, I presume, it is to do away with arms and munitions.</P>

I have a notion that all this balderdash about defending this country is talked from a wrong angle.  If we are going to talk about defending the country from those outside who are going to attack it, either now or in future, we will have to talk about the proper defensive tactics that should be adopted by an island such as this.  It is not going to be defended against great naval powers by a few thousand men who stand to attention in Athlone, Templemore, or Dundalk.  If we are to talk about real defence forces we will have to talk about aeroplanes and submarines.  I am in favour, particularly in view of the mentality of the Minister and Deputy Aiken, of getting rid of armies for a particular period of years, and to giving up even talking about them.  What I really rose to refer to was the military reception which has been given to distinguished visitors, presumably on the suggestion of the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>I am always a bit nervous listening to Deputy Aiken, because I do not know whether or not he is still a member of the Irish Republican Army.  I always feel alarmed discussing the defence of our State in the presence of eminent members of that Party which is engaged in subterranean conspiracies against our State.  For all I know, Deputy Tubridy may be the head of a great Black Hand gang which is plotting secretly for the overthrow of our institutions.  And yet they are allowed to come into the Dáil, to utilise every modern convenience <Col N="655" /> here, to be shown everything that there is to be shown in our State, and to be allowed to discuss the defence of our State.</P>
      <P>There is one element in this Estimate which appears to have been overlooked by the Deputies who have spoken, and that is sub-head N.  It refers to the purchase of horses for the Army jumping team.  As far as my information goes, the Minister has not been very generous in his treatment of the Army jumping team which has brought great credit to this country and has done a lot of good in the way of advertising Irish horses abroad.  Our jumping team in America has won great successes, and, in spite of the efforts of Deputy de Valera to minimise the effect of that good propaganda for our State, I think it has increased the sale of Irish horses in the United States. The Minister who, of all Ministers, is the one most beloved by the Department of Finance because he always submits to their cheeseparing methods, has not treated the officers and men connected with the Army jumping team with the generosity which they deserve, not only from the Army but from the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I understand foreign jumping teams are largely manned by men of private means.  Even in those teams the prize money is divided between the horse and the rider. One half goes to the rider and the other half to the Army, or whatever fund is concerned.  The sum total of the prize money which is won by our officers is captured by the Minister as agent for the rapacious Minister for Finance.  There are many other items in connection with the trips abroad of our jumping team which the Minister should look into, and I hope he will be a little more generous in his treatment of these men who have undoubtedly brought honour and credit to the country.</P>

      <P>He spoke of the type of Army that Ireland would need and he said that we have not a real defence force.  To my mind the organisation that is called an Army is useless as a defence force.  It is not the fault of the men who are in it and possibly not the fault of the officers over it, but you might as well have as many men in their shirts or their bare skins as to have men equipped as they are to-day to defend the country.  If there were to exist a real defence force in this or any other country you would have to spend ten times as much money as you are spending.  It is a farce and not an Army.  That is not due to any fault on the part of the individuals concerned.</P>

Republican and were equipped as they are to-day to defend Ireland they could not do it and they could do very little beyond demonstrate.  They could not defend Ireland against any country that might invade our shores.  We are spending one and a half millions on the Army and I say that we would get as much value if we reduced that amount by two-thirds.  If you want the force to be a token force just as this is a token estimate you could <Col N="657" /> get that equally as well by spending only one-third of the amount that you are spending on the token army of to-day.  Any army worthy of the name in any country to-day has to be equipped in an entirely different manner as compared with our Army. So far as my knowledge of it and its equipment goes I may say that to be a real defence force it will have to be better equipped.  An army to-day is a very highly-scientific and technical organisation.  It has to have associated with it technical equipment that is of the most costly character&mdash; aeroplanes, chemicals, artillery of certain kinds, tanks, machine guns of a varied character and a highly-equipped organisation for the manufacture of the arms and implements of war.  We have none of these in this country.  There is a kind of token air force.  I wonder how many aeroplanes they have.</P>

      <P>I mention it in passing as part of the highly-scientific equipment that an army requires. We are not likely to have it, because under present conditions we cannot afford it.  We could well do with a token army the cost of which would be reduced to one-third of the present figure, and it would not be less effective.  Perhaps it would be more effective than the Army that is costing one and a half millions now. That Army is of no value, even to the Free State.  I quite agree, as Deputy Davin pointed out, that it is balderdash to be talking about defending the country with an army of that type.  The Deputy asked who would be likely to attack us. I maintain, but I suppose the Deputy would not agree, that we are being attacked in our sovereignty every day.  When we will rise to defend ourselves against that attack upon our sovereignty is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being attacked, and our sovereignty is being attacked every day in this State.  I suppose we here in this House&mdash;the majority of us at any rate&mdash;have no desire to attempt to repel that attack, having no desire <Col N="658" /> to remove those who are invading our rights.  Well, that may happen some day or another, not perhaps this year or next year, or the year after, but perhaps ten years hence.  That will be achieved perhaps some day, not by an army, but I hope it will be done in some way other than by the shedding of blood. That it will have to be done, and attempted to be done, some day is as certain as that we are here now.  I hope sincerely that an army will not be necessary to achieve the final freedom and the sovereignty of Ireland, securing our rights and winning them back and securing the independence of our country.  I hope the Army will not be necessary for that.  But an army of the present type, equipped as that is with a tenfold increase in numbers, would not perhaps achieve it, because the present Army's equipment is as antiquated as at the Battle of Waterloo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned one or two points about the horsemen who went abroad.  I do not know. Perhaps they did well in their competition, but from any of the results that we saw I know that my recollection is that these men did not win one single first prize in any important competition.  It may be no fault of their own.  It may be due, as Deputy Esmonde said, to the penuriousness of the Department concerned, that they did not win any first class prize in an important competition.  That is my recollection of the reports as I read them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In some minor competitions they won first-prize but in nothing important.  They were not any credit to this country and that was not due to the men's fault and not due to the horses' fault.  If more money were spent on them they might have done better.  I do not know.  At any rate as the matter stands they did not win first-prize in any important competition.  If Deputy Esmonde hopes to get much benefit for the men concerned out of the prize money, I am afraid he will <Col N="659" /> find that that prize money would not stand him many drinks.  The prize money they got altogether in their competitions would not stand many drinks.  If you are sending men out&mdash;and I am not advocating that you do send them out&mdash;but if you do, spend money on them and try to make them what would be worthy of the horsemanship of this country, and the horse flesh of this country.  You sent out second and third rate horses.  I do not know anything about the men you sent out, but if the horses sent out were worthy of the traditions of the country they should get the first prize everywhere.  If you are sending out these teams do not do it in a half-hearted way.  Again, I say I am not advocating that they should be sent out, but if you are sending anybody, send the best, do not send a boy on a man's errand.  There is just one other question.  I do not know if this is in order or not.  It is a question of the gratuity.  I would like to know if the gratuity to Deputy McKeon is included in this Vote.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that it would be regrettable if it went out from this House that the feelings of representatives of the people in this country were given expression to by the Deputy who has just spoken.  In that speech there was pessimism, defeat and a sense of failure&mdash;that we can do nothing, that we are not able to fight anybody. If everybody in this country was armed with a blackthorn, I suppose we could not, but I would suggest another weapon.  I think it should not go forth from this House that the Irish race and the people we represent are not still able to defend our shores.  I think the Deputy called it our sovereignty. I am very glad to hear the Deputy say that and to acknowledge that we have a sovereignty to defend.  I am very pleased to hear him say that he would be glad in future if more money were spent on the teams that were sent abroad to exhibit before the people of other countries, and to show what Irishmen can do in the matter of horsemanship.  I notice that there is an attempt made by the Deputies opposite to make a joke of this Vote.  They speak of a token Vote and a token Army.  It is a token Vote, and it is really a token of what the policy in this country will be, namely, to defend the country by the Volunteer Defence Forces, the O.T.C., and the ordinary Reserve.  If that policy develops it will give an opportunity to persons of all political thought and creed to take a part in defending their country&mdash;I had almost said either sex in the country.  I hope it will not include the Cumann-namBan. But I trust it will give an opportunity to the young people who have not grown up and who did not suffer from those bees in the bonnets&mdash;from that feeling of defeat and from that anti-Army bug that a number of persons who spoke from <Col N="661" /> the Opposition Benches in this House suffer from; and naturally they should suffer from it, because the Army did beat them; when their generals set forth to fight they beat them.</P>

I was speaking on the advisability of the development of the Volunteer Reserve, and I submit I am in order.  It would be advisable and it would be a happy thing in this country if the persons who did not suffer from any of these causes of defeat or otherwise and who did not suffer from any of these bugs would get an opportunity of saying that this is their country.  I think it is very regrettable that a Deputy here should make a remark to-night derogatory of the intentions of persons in one particular University in this country who joined the O.T.C. in that University.</P>

If the Deputy who made those derogatory remarks understood that if he had actually joined the O.T.C. like the persons who had not the traditions behind them that the Deputy has it might be a good thing.  We suffer and possibly enjoy a good deal in this country because of those traditions. The more I think that we meet the people of this country who have not the same line of thought and the same line of tradition behind them as the Deputies on the opposite Benches claim to have&mdash;those sea-green Republicans, persons who <Col N="662" /> would fight with blackthorns&mdash;the better.

      <P>It is nothing short of disgusting to hear Irishmen traducing and running down everything connected with their own country simply because they are jealous of and do not like the Army.  I hold that the Irish horse and the Irish horsemen have, perhaps, done more to bring the name of this small country before the world than anything else.  The performance of our Army officers at the Horse Show last year and the year before won the admiration not only of Irishmen but of the whole world.  When they went abroad to compete the jumps arranged for the competitions were such that they had not been used to and yet they did splendidly.  The horses had to travel to these countries, and we all know that travelling does not improve horses.  Having studied the results won by our officers abroad and heard the opinions of people well qualified to judge, I think they did remarkably well.  Irishmen in America, regardless of their political opinions, were the proudest people on earth when they witnessed the success of the officers of our Army, with their Irish horses, in that country.  A few years ago such a thing was not even dreamed of or contemplated.  I think it is nothing short of disgusting to have to listen to this continual wail-walling of Fianna Fáil.  According to that Party everything in Ireland is rotten.  We are poor, and everything here is to be abused.  I think that, on the contrary, this is a great country.  I am afraid we do not realise how great it is.  We have one of the finest countries in the world. It is admired by people of every other country in the world except by a small section of our own people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. Kerlin Mr. Kerlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to elaborate one or two points raised in connection with the Volunteer Reserve and the Officers' Training Corps.  Deputy O'Sullivan seemed to take exception to the objections raised to the Minister's policy in regard to the Officers' Training Corps <Col N="663" /> in Trinity College.  The Minister said that the members of Trinity College who had joined the Officers' Training Corps were actuated solely by a desire to serve Ireland.  I have an extract here from an article which appeared in the &ldquo;Trinity College Magazine&rdquo; which throws an interesting sidelight on whether that statement of the Minister is true or not.  The article starts off by stating:</P>
      <P>In the first place, Trinity is, and will continue to be, loyal to the British connection.  More than 3,000 of our men fought in the war, and nearly 500 were killed. As I think, therefore, it is essential to the success of the Corps that its officers shall be College men who served at the Front, and now are willing to do their best to serve the Free State as a Dominion of the Empire.  If we have our own officers, furthermore, confidence in the Corps will be encouraged in Northern Ireland, whence College draws so many of its best students; and every man in Trinity will be able to join the Corps without political or national misgivings.  In the second place, I take the view that the formation of an O.T.C. in College would provide an excellent opportunity to promote reconciliation between Britain, Northern Ireland and the Free State.  It would prove to the Free State Government that College is not unwilling to take its proper place in the country.</P>
      <P>What follows is the most important:</P>
      <P>And, if it were organised properly, it might constitute a highly valuable liaison between the Free State and British armies.  To that end, might I suggest that part of the annual training should be held in the Free State, and the other part either in England, or in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the attitude of Trinity College towards the formation of the Officers' Training Corps.  That is one of the reasons why they welcome it.  Some of these people look upon <Col N="664" /> the O.T.C. as a jumping-off ground for the British Army.  I cannot see that that fits in with the Minister's statement that these men, in joining it, were actuated solely by the desire to serve Ireland.  There is another point that I want to make in connection with the Volunteer Reserve itself.  The Minister, in the debate that took place yesterday, seemed to give the impression that there was a distinct difference between this Volunteer Reserve and the B. Reserve.  He implied that there was no grant or gratuities in connection with this force.  I looked over the regulations, and I find that these men are entitled to grants varying from £5 to £15 per annum, to extra payment in respect of drill above a certain percentage.  In fact, I think that on the whole these men will receive higher payments than the men in the B. Reserve.  I would like if the Minister would point out the essential difference between the B. Reserve and the Volunteer Reserve, that is, leaving out the fact of the three months' initial training.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. B. O'Connor Mr. B. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Vote.  Deputy O'Kelly in his speech seemed to question whether our Army would be fit to meet any force that might oppose the sovereignty of the people of this country. Listening to him, I tried to think what force was most opposed to the sovereignty of our people.  It struck me that it was the Party which the Deputy represents.  The sovereignty of this country is the will of the Irish people.  The Irish people, by the majorities they gave at the elections, established their Government.  That Government has raised an Army which they think is suitable for the requirements of the country.  The only challenge to the will of the Irish people comes from the Party Deputy O'Kelly represents.  I know the country well.  I keep my ear close to the ground.  A great many people say to me: &ldquo;You do not want a big Army, all you want is an Army fit to keep in control the people who challence your right to govern in this country.&rdquo;  I really think that this country would require no Army at <Col N="665" /> all were it not for the fact, as was remarked on a previous occasion, that we want it as an assurance for the Irish people that something is not going to happen again such as happened some years ago.  We have no need for an Army at all except to keep peace in the country.  I think there is no fear of any outside force attacking the sovereignty of the country.  Our troubles are internal, and I think our Army is quite capable of dealing with any internal trouble that may arise.  I agree with Deputy Shaw that Deputies sitting here in our native Parliament who belittle the efforts of our Army abroad show very bad taste indeed. I have received letters from America, and I read in the American newspapers as well, accounts which gave wonderful praise and credit to the members of our Army for the distinctions they won in competition against armies from other countries that had years of tradition and of training behind them, and armies, too, that were not stinted in any way so far as financial support went.  I think our Army did very well, and the people in America are proud of them.  It ill becomes Deputy O'Kelly to stand up here in the House and make little of his own people who did their best to uphold the traditions of this country abroad. I am greatly surprised that Deputy O'Kelly expressed the remarks he did here to-night.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy said that, independent of Army pensions, the expenditure on the Army was £1,600,000, roughly.  His roughness was only £200,000 out. He questioned was there a real national Government in control of the country.  The Government in control of the country is the result of elections held on adult suffrage. These elections indicated the persons in whom the power of government should rest.  The Deputy says we must have got our advertisements at a special rate.  He thinks we spend several thousands, if not tens of thousands, on advertisements.  It may be the notion of prices given for advertisements which makes Deputies opposite so fantastically optimistic about the future of their proposed newspaper.  The fact is that there was nothing like £1,000 spent on advertisements.  He talked of the comparatively large number who came forward in Trinity College.  I do not think it was a comparatively large number.  I am very glad to see young men.  I do not mind what Party they belong to, coming forward and joining a body of men whose sole purpose is to make themselves available for the service of the country.  I do not care whether they come from Trinity College, Fianna Fáil or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It is not its purpose. Deputy Davin talked about my making a fighting and provocative speech yesterday, and he commented on that as being out of harmony with the fact of our being represented at the Naval Disarmament Conference in London.  Yesterday I said nothing in my remarks that could be regarded as of a fighting and provocative nature.  As a matter of fact, the only complaint made about my remarks was that I did not say enough.  Following the innocuous and inoffensive remarks of mine a general discussion took place.  Deputies opposite objected to certain things, and they made <Col N="667" /> charges that were mutually contradictory, for they have no coherence of thought amongst them.  I endeavoured to reply to remarks that showed an ignorance and wrongheadedness calculated to make one angry.  In relation to a fighting and provocative speech, and as to having a representative at the Naval Disarmament Conference in London, there was one part of my speech which bore on that.  I do not remember my exact words, but they were something like this: that the Army and Volunteer Reserve exists for the reason that the Irish Free State exists, for the well-being of all the people who live in the State, and that it was necessary for their material and spiritual well-being. That being so, it was a reasonable thing they should come forward and defend the State in case of need. That was the only statement I made which had any relation whatever to our being represented at the Naval Conference.  That statement I do not regard as coming under the description of fighting and provocative, but as simply an ordinary elementary statement of civic ethics, and entirely in harmony with any effort that may be made in any part of the world in the interests of peace.</P>

      <P>He said that the amount they won would not have gone far in the way of buying drinks for them.  I may say that if the team <Col N="669" /> during their absence had consumed drinks to the value of a small fraction of the prize money won, I should have felt called upon to get them out of the Army on account of their heavy drinking habits.  As a matter of fact, the team did extraordinarily well.  They have brought a name both to our country and to Irish horses that has been quite extraordinary. I have seen reports from interested people in the countries they have visited and I have also heard from people in a position to speak authoritatively that their performances in these countries has had the immediate effect of increasing the sale of Irish horses. The men have held their own with practically every country with which they competed.  They have won prizes equal to those won by any other country at the shows at which they have competed and certainly the prize money amounted to a very substantial sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Something over £1,000.  I am not speaking by the book, but it is roughly about that. That comes in as a grant-in-aid. The financial system of the State cannot be carried on in that way, that when money is to be spent, it is to be spent out of State funds, but that when it is earned, it has to go into private pockets.  That is not our financial system here.  Deputy Kerlin I think suggested that I was misleading yesterday when I spoke of the difference between the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve and the Volunteer Reserve. I think it was Deputy Aiken who talked about men starving in this country and still not joining the Volunteer Reserve.  I pointed out to <Col N="670" /> him that, if such a question as starvation came into the matter, the more likely thing for a man to join would be the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the gratuities, such as they are, from £5 to £15 for the Volunteer Reserve are only paid after a year's drills and a fortnight in camp.  I put it to the Deputy that if he were in the starving condition that Deputy Aiken thinks everybody in this country is in, and he had the choice of joining the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve and being fed and paid immediately for three months, or of participating in one year's drill, plus a fortnight in camp, and getting a gratuity, he would, I think, choose the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve.  That was, I think, the gist of my remarks yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the &ldquo;B&rdquo; reservist is paid in the ordinary way as an ordinary soldier when he joins for the first three months.  When he is called up for training he receives 30 days' pay at 2/- per day, and he gets a service grant at the end of the time.  He is actually paid during his time of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When he joins the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve, he joins by actually coming in for training. The Deputy does not seem to have read the regulations in the matter.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £100 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1930, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Ordnance Survey <Col N="673" /> and of minor services connected therewith, including the Facsimile Reproduction of Ancient Manuscripts.</P>
    <P>When the Manuscripts Commission was constituted in October, 1928, one of the terms of reference was the facsimile reproduction of important codices.  The Commission decided to begin that part of their work with the facsimile reproduction of the Book of Lechain and of an ancient law tract, H. 2&mdash;15, in Trinity College Library.  When they got so far the question had to be decided whether an attempt should be made to have the work carried out here or whether it should be sent abroad. After consideration, we came to the conclusion that we could get the work very satisfactorily done in the Ordnance Survey, where there was actually a man who had experience of this work, but in order that the reproduction might be made in what is called the collotype process, which is the best for this sort of work, it was necessary that a certain additional plant should be installed.  It is estimated that the work could be done in the Ordnance Survey Department at about two-thirds of the cost that would have to be paid to an outside contractor, and after careful consideration it was decided to instal that plant and do the work at home. The capital outlay which is involved will be repaid in the course of probably three or four years, and, of <Col N="674" /> course, it is more satisfactory to have the work done here and to have any employment that might be given, given here.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree in part with the Seanad in amendment No. 6.  Before Section 31 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31. &mdash;(1)  The Minister may establish by order a Consultative Council for the purpose of giving advice and assistance to the Minister in connection with any matter in relation to the making of regulations under, or otherwise carrying into execution, the provisions of this Act, or any other matter affecting the preservation and propagation of game or any other matter affecting the game industry.</P>
      <P>(2)  The said Consultative Council, if and when appointed, shall consist of such persons (being persons having experience or special knowledge in relation to the matters on which the Council may give advice or assistance to the Minister) as the Minister shall from time to time nominate to be members thereof, and shall include representatives of both Houses of the Oireachtas and of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Each member of the said Consultative Council shall, unless he previously dies or resigns, retain <Col N="677" /> his membership for two years only from the date of his nomination, but shall be eligible for renomination.</P>
    <P>(4)  The said Consultative Council shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister and also on such occasions as the Council may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(5)  Payments may be made by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to the members of the said Consultative Council and Committeés thereof to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a new section which was inserted in the Seanad.  It gives the Minister power to establish, if he thinks it advisable, a Consultative Council.  I do not see that it can do any harm to have such a principle included in this Bill, because it may, in working, turn out that the Minister for Justice, whoever he may be, may require expert opinion, but Deputies will notice the provisions of sub-section (5): &ldquo;payments may be made by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to the members of the said Consultative Council and Committees thereof to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.&rdquo; That is a money clause and that has been inserted in the amendment.  I would suggest to the Dáil that sub-section (5) should not be accepted by this House, but that the House would accept this new Section 31 with the exception of sub-section (5).</P>

      <P>In introducing this Bill Deputy Little and myself hoped that we would find some form on which there could be agreement in the House.  We are not stating that every section in the Bill, as we have it, is in absolutely the best terms, or that it would bring about the position we desire to see in connection with people carrying on this business.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies are aware that there are people carrying on business as moneylenders who charge an extortionate rate of interest.  The methods they adopt to get great profit are not desirable, and are not in the best interests of the individuals concerned, or the community. Moneylending is one of the most ancient forms of business, but in all forms of society, and in all instructions laid down as regards the moral code, money lending has been regarded as a business which has to have some form of rules for its conduct because of the dangers which arise if there is not proper control. I am prepared to admit that there are certain persons engaged in this business who can be classed as financiers, who lend money at moderate rates of interest for productive purposes, and who in order to ensure getting back that money do not charge extortionate rates.  They want to be assured, however, of the success of the individual or concern to whom they lend money, so that they will get their profit and carry on their business in a decent and reasonable manner.  But again there are in Dublin particularly, persons carrying on this business, whom I could describe as nothing else but money hawkers.  They go from house to house offering and inducing the wives of working men to borrow money, for the purpose of getting them into their power, and keeping them paying perpetually certain sums weekly, without any regard to the original amount lent, or any morality with regard to reasonable rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had occasion personally to arbitrate settlements between borrowers and lenders frequently in the <Col N="680" /> last four or five years, and I must say that I have found instances of harshness, unreasonableness and blackmail which really were shocking and which fortify me in asking the House to give support to a measure which will protect borrowers from the impositions which are attempted by a lot of these usurers called moneylenders.  I am not going at this stage to give the House a list of settlements or illustrations of particular forms of moneylending or of the particular circumstances of transactions, but I know that from the highest to the lowest in the State, people are in the hands of moneylenders. They are used and abused by these moneylenders in a manner which is not bringing about that sense of security which we should have.  You have civil servants in the hands of these people.  I know of a case of a collector of income tax who is in their hands.  I arbitrated a settlement in the case of a civil servant who was in the hands of five moneylenders who formed some kind of pool and made it their business to get this man into their clutches. They made it impossible for him to live within his income in a decent manner.  I know of bank officials and of people in the slum districts who are in the hands of moneylenders and whom I helped on occasions to arbitrate for a settlement which gave them some relief.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks in the first place to licence moneylenders.  It also provides that a licence shall be granted only to people who hold certificates from a magistrate and so assures that persons of good character only will be permitted to carry on this business.  There are certain regulations laid down in regard to advertising. At present you will find in the Press of this country misleading advertisements from moneylending concerns which are inserted for the purpose, not of lending money to people who require it in a legitimate manner at a legitimate rate of interest, but of misleading the public. I know of cases where people have answered these advertisements.  They <Col N="681" /> see an advertisement stating &ldquo;Money to lend; £5 for 5s.&rdquo;  They write to this concern and they receive an acknowledgement and a request for certain information about the individual applicant, as regards his form of employment, his salary, etc., and a further request afterwards for confirmation of the statements which he has made.  Then they inform the intending borrower that the rate of 5s. for £5 does not necessarily mean per annum but in fact might mean for a month or a week.  In some cases the borrower tries to withdraw but finds himself confronted with a request for fees in respect of the work which the moneylenders say his application has entailed.  Sometimes a request is made for a fee to enable the firm to make further inquiries. In some cases I am told the moneylenders get a list of intending borrowers as the result of the insertion of a single advertisement.  They then send over somebody to interview the intending borrowers.  They charge a fee for the interview and after the interviewer goes back they probably lend portion of the money which they have collected in fees to one or two applicants.  This Bill definitely sets out to stop this form of misleading advertisement.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a clause providing for forfeiture of the licence for certain offences under the Act.  One section has been inserted in this Bill which is not in the English Bill, on which, to a great extent, this Bill has been modelled. That is the section which deals with cases in which a married woman borrows money without the knowledge and consent of her husband. I know of many cases where moneylenders induce a workingman's wife or other married women who are dependent on their husbands to borrow money without the knowledge or consent of the husband, the reason for that being that they always have the woman in fear of the husband finding out and, as a result, they can command a much higher rate of interest or a much greater number of payments from the person concerned. This Bill seeks to make null and void any transaction between <Col N="682" /> moneylenders and married women unless the transaction is carried out with the knowledge and consent of the husbands of these women.  It seeks to curtail the activities of the money hawker who goes out canvassing from house to house or who sends out agents canvassing from house to house, and provides that all such business shall be transacted in the registered offices of the moneylenders concerned.  It also provides for a proper means of book-keeping and a proper system of understanding between the lender and the borrower. It provides that the borrower at all times shall have an opportunity of knowing exactly how he stands and that he can demand, and get for a fee of 1/-, a statement of accounts from the moneylender. I do not know whether there is going to be any opposition to the Bill in principle.  The promoter of the Bill is anxious that an agreement should be found so as to bring about some restriction in the activities of moneylenders, who are becoming a source of danger to the community.  It, at the same time, seeks to give some protection to the borrower who is a legitimate borrower from exorbitant rates of interest, and particularly from the blackmail which is associated with this particular trade.</P>
    <P>A case which is typical of the transactions which this Bill seeks to kill is this one: a small borrower for the purpose of visiting the betting office or, to get something which is outside the capacity of his ordinary income, borrows £5.  He gets immediately £3 15s. in cash, 5/- in the £1 being charged as interest.  That is immediately deducted from the total amount.  That £3 15s. which he receives is payable, plus the £1 5s. charged as interest, at the rate of 5/- per week.  The moneylender does not want that transaction completed. If a person borrowed a certain amount of money, repaid it, and finished there that would not satisfy a certain class of moneylender. What he wishes and what he wants is that after about ten weeks, when £2 10s. has been repaid, the borrower should come along and renew his <Col N="683" /> loan.  He again gets the borrower to sign a bill for £5 but he does not give him this time £3 15s.  He gives him £3 15s. less the balance of what is coming from the original £5.  That is £1 5s., but he still owes £5.  He has received altogether £3 15s. plus £1 5s., which means that he has just received £5 and he has paid back £2 10s. and now he owes another £5. Another ten weeks go by and a similar transaction is again gone through.  If you follow it up, you will find that at the end of 40 weeks the unfortunate borrower still has £5 to pay at the rate of 5/- per week and for the last ten weeks he has been paying 5/- per week for the loan of £3 10s. of his own money. Compound interest is compound interest but, when it comes somewhere between 1,000 and 1,800 per cent, it is time that the State should step in and prohibit compound interest on money loaned in this way.  This Bill prevents renewals of such loans and is designed so that at all times each transaction can be traced and the amount of interest charged can be followed up.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House very long by giving illustrations.  I believe the House will admit that there are a great many more moneylenders carrying on business in the State than one would imagine if one were to look up the register of moneylenders.  I had moneylenders coming to me when I was settling cases, or shortly after the Bill was introduced, and they told me that they had never brought a person to court.  I found the reason that they did not bring people to court was that they had not been registered under the Act.  A person who is not registered as a moneylender at present cannot claim money due arising out of a moneylending transaction. That may seem a hardship, but it is time to curb the individual who employs blackmailing tactics to ensure the return of his money.  As I stated before, some of these men work together in groups.  Five of them usually pool a certain amount of money.  They then, perhaps, induce <Col N="684" /> a certain old lady to borrow £25, if they know she has a son who has a decent position.  Perhaps he has a position in the bank or the Civil Service, or possibly in the Army. They do not give her £25; they deduct their rate of interest.  They keep renewing the bill although they get no money, and then, when a large sum is due, they proceed to press her for payment.  It is only at the last moment, when she is threatened with the loss of her home through being sold out that she approaches her son, who, perhaps, has not got £50 or £60 handy.  He is faced with the disgrace of his mother being sold out because of the transaction with the moneylenders and he, unfortunately, signs a bill with the mother.  The pool gets a grip then and starts to press.</P>
    <P>I know of one case where a man in a bank became involved in that manner and was terrorised because of the visits paid during office hours by the moneylenders concerned asking him for further instalments.  If his manager were to see him he would imagine that he was in the hands of moneylenders, and would have no faith and confidence in him, would stop his promotion or discharge him.  He is not supposed to be in debt if he occupies a position of that kind.  Usually such a man is driven to desperation, and in many cases to dishonesty, to satisfy these people, who will accept nothing but their full pound of flesh.  I know of the methods employed by many of the people engaged in this business, but I do not believe it is necessary at this stage to recite them here, because I believe every member of the House knows from his own knowledge of people who have made complaints in regard to these moneylenders. I am talking now of usury, of a person who is out for the purpose of getting exorbitant rates of interest.  Such a person should be brought under control, and if he cannot carry on his business in a legitimate manner under the provisions of this Bill we can do without him, and he should be told that he can employ his money in some other <Col N="685" /> business in which it will be more useful.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to penalise the person who is lending money at reasonable rates.  Sometimes the small trader may find that he has to obtain a loan to pay the wages of employees and he may get a small loan from a legitimate moneylender to carry on.  I am also told that decent financiers are of use to solicitors in the matter of giving advances against unsettled estates, but these solicitors are able to protect their clients' interests against blackmail or anything of that kind.  This Bill will make it possible for people to carry on this business in a decent manner and will give some protection to those who have to resort to moneylenders. I hope there will be some form of agreement in regard to the Bill and that the Government will accept it, because we know that after this stage the Bill cannot be piloted any further by a private member.  We hope that the Government will accept it and take charge of the further stages.  We on this side of the House will give every help and assistance to get the measure passed into law.  It has as its main principle the protection of borrowers against usurers and the confining of business within reasonable limits.</P>

      <P>I think everybody is in agreement that this Bill is of the greatest necessity.  Only recently a comment has been made in a paper which has a pretty sound reputation from the financial point of view, namely, &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; expressing amazement that legislation in the Free State had not been brought up to the same level as it is in England. This quotation stated that both in the Free State and Northern Ireland we were behind in this matter and that the evil was very great, that all classes of the community, civil servants, and officials of various kinds, were the victims, as well as poorer people.  It is quite true that we are very much behind.  It is a rather humorous aspect of this evil that the first group of people who tried to tackle moneylenders in Ireland were the extreme Sinn Feiners, who made an effort some years ago by means of physical force to intimidate moneylenders in the City of Dublin.  That was followed up by Lord Carson's efforts in London when he introduced, or took a prominent part in introducing, a Bill in England which is now on the Statute Book.  We are in the peculiar position of following in the footsteps of two sets of extremists in order to do for the Free State what ought to have been done long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking the other day to a man who sees a good deal of the poor, because his business carries him in and out of the houses of the poor.  He says that this is an evil that is almost ineradicable; it is almost impossible to get rid of it. We should try to make a big effort to get rid of it, and we should act in a careful and cautious way.  We are following to a large extent precedents that have been laid down for us.  We are taking advantage of enquiries that have been made in other countries, and we want to legislate in such a way that we will not do more harm than good in the eradication of the evil.  There would be two ways of approaching the matter, one of which would be to abolish moneylending altogether, to <Col N="687" /> go in for a form of prohibition. That is not so advisable as to keep the thing in control and to watch it carefully.  This Bill aims at carrying out those proposals.  That the Bill is necessary is clear from the legislation in existence.  At present we are working under two Acts, the Act of 1900 and the Act of 1911. The former Act gives facilities for persons to go into court.  The question is then examined carefully by the District or the Circuit Court Judge.  The judge has power to enquire into the rate of interest and, if it is unconscionable, the word used in the Act, he can reopen the whole agreement.  But the Act is vague and does not set up any standard interest.  There is, also, not the same supervision.  According to the Act of 1900, moneylenders must register only once every three years and they do not come under the same control as under this Bill. Again, there is a section which prevents moneylenders or their agents from issuing deceptive statements or dishonestly concealing material facts.</P>
    <P>The Act as it stands does not deal adequately with the evil.  I think everybody realises that there is not sufficient supervision or sufficient control over moneylenders.  The Bill lays down that moneylenders must take out a licence.  Deputy Briscoe said that the Bill could not go ahead in its present form unless we got the approval of the Government, because a moneylender's licence means the raising of revenue, and only the Government can consent to the raising of revenue.  If the Government were not willing to give its approval to this Bill we could drop that particular clause and still go ahead without the imposition of any licence fee.  That licence fee would be £10 per year for each moneylender in respect of each office he would establish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does that appear?  The Deputy is not referring to sections, and might I ask where the £10 is referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="688" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Section 1.  The amount is £15, reducible to £10 if paid before a certain period.  Section 2, deals with the granting of a certificate to the moneylender.  A certificate will be granted on application to the District Justice.  He will issue that certificate from year to year and he has power under the Bill to suspend, endorse or cancel the licence.  In that way he has a very considerable control.  Certain details must be supplied with the application showing that the moneylender is a person of good character and is a fit and proper person to carry on business as a moneylender.  In that way a man must be of good standing before he will be allowed to become a moneylender.  Of course a great deal will depend upon the administration when it comes to making this measure effective.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister for Finance came in I was mentioning that the imposition of a fee would depend largely upon whether he decided it is advisable or not.  If he does not feel inclined to give his approval we would be obliged to drop that section. On the other hand, if he would like to regard this Bill as a windfall from the point of view of the revenue he could do so and he could look forward to a £10 licence from something like 260 registered money-lenders, and possibly more.  Section 3 of the Bill deals with the powers of the District Justice to suspend or forfeit a moneylender's certificate. The rules are pretty severe.  There are very careful regulations laid down in Section 4 as to the moneylender's true name being entered upon the certificate and also his authorised name.  A firm might consist of two or three persons, and it may have a special name.  The names of the partners must be on each certificate and also the authorised name of the firm.  As regards the Act of 1916, dealing with the names of persons, there used to be great abuses formerly, people using fictitious names.  They were dealt with by legislation and that legislation is incorporated by reference with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> There are severe restrictions upon the advertisements which money-lenders may use.  They are not allowed to send around circulars or put anything in the Press except certain specific details.  For instance, they are only allowed to state their name, address and number, and the amount up to which they are prepared to lend, together with the rate of interest.  They are not allowed to hold out any inducement and in that way they are prevented from attracting people into borrowing money who otherwise would probably never think of going in for it.  I have here some documents which are sent out at present.  They are documents which could not possibly be sent out in England because of the legislation there.  In fact, on account of the Act in England it becomes necessary for us in this country to legislate because this country has become a sort of happy hunting-ground for moneylenders.  They can do things here which they could not do in England.</P>
    <P>Here is the type of advertisement which would be forbidden in England. This is form a company which calls itself the English Discount Company and it is marked &ldquo;strictly private and confidential; no inquiries made, no security required; no fees; no expenses or charges whatsoever.&rdquo;  The letter reads: &ldquo;Dear Sir, or Madam, I should be glad to accommodate you with cash by post at a reasonable interest without any security or publicity whatsoever. Should you require a cash accommodation there is no necessity to be under an obligation to your friends or to your local bank as we offer special easy terms to suit the convenience of either sex, married or single.  For very little interest you can be accommodated with whatever money you require and you can arrange same to be paid by monthly instalments.  We also wish to point out to you that we require no personal interview, as loans can be arranged by post.  All communications will be sent in sealed envelopes and to any address you desire. Please let me know the amount you require and cash will be posted <Col N="690" /> to you without delay and in the strictest privacy.  No business will be entertained with those under age.&rdquo;&mdash;keeping within the four corners of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a charming person.  Would you put me in touch with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are just the kind of advertisements which would be absolutely forbidden by the Bill if it becomes an Act.  By the way, Section 5 of this Bill was the substance of Deputy Cooper's Bill.  I must say that as he is not able to be here he said that he would be quite willing, if we were able to get our Bill through the Second Reading, to take a hand in any Committee business afterwards.  He said that the reason he did not make his Bill larger and a Bill with more sections in it is because he was not in very good health.  I mention that so that we can count on his support provided the Bill goes through the Second Reading Stage.  In Section 6 we try to deal with a rather difficult matter.  That is with firms which might work from outside. For instance, the Six Counties have not yet dealt with this evil.  It would be possible for a firm to send these enticing letters from Belfast to people in Dublin, and to try to use Belfast as a jumping-off ground by means of advertisements in order to get business inside the Free State. We here want to make the terms of the Bill as stringent as possible so as to get after these people.  For instance, a firm might say: &ldquo;We have two branches one in Belfast and one in Dublin.&rdquo;  If that firm was advertising from Belfast it might say: &ldquo;We are not breaking the Act, that branch is outside the Act.&rdquo;  We want to make sure that that particular kind of trick is not played on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A form of the moneylenders' contract is laid down in Section 7 of the Bill.  The note or memorandum must be made and signed personally by the borrower, and, where the borrower is a married woman living with her husband, by the borrower and the husband.  I think that <Col N="691" /> under the present law it may not be quite necessary to put that in, because the law already gives protection. In any case, it is due to us to make sure that the public will know in general that a woman cannot be led into this trap without the actual consent of her husband.  I know of one extremely tragic case of a person in a respectable position in Dublin where the woman got a loan of money for household purposes.  She did not tell her husband.  The matter preyed so much upon her that she went out of her mind and she is at present in a lunatic asylum.  We want as explicitly as possible to warn women that they cannot be led into this kind of borrowing without the consent of their husbands.  Section 8 prohibits compound interest. That matter has been fairly well dealt with by Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is an extremely important section.  It deals with the obligations of moneylenders to supply information as to the state of the loan and copies of documents relating thereto.  Under this section anybody who is in the clutches of moneylenders is protected in this way.  Secrecy is the one thing which a person who has borrowed money wants to maintain.  Under this section he is in a position to maintain that secrecy, because he can insist upon an absolute statement of the exact conditions of the loan; how much the original loan was; the date upon which the money was borrowed; the amount of interest which has accured; the dates upon which payments were made; the sums paid and the amount still due.</P>
    <P>In that way, a memorandum, if honestly supplied by these usurers, would in most cases show that the money had been paid several times over, and it would place the borrower in a position of not having to pay any more.  On the other hand, it is more likely that the moneylender will simply remain silent and not supply that document.  If he does not supply it he is completely disarmed, because after a month of silence, the borrower need pay no more; no interest will accure, <Col N="692" /> and if the moneylender still persists in not giving the details asked for if after proceedings &ldquo;have ceased to lie&rdquo; in respect of the loan, he will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5 for every day on which the default continues. Now, the meaning of the words in the section, &ldquo;after proceedings have ceased to lie in respect of the loan,&rdquo; are shown under Section 13.  Usually, of course, proceedings lie for six years after the debt is due, or after the last acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.  But in this case, under Section 13, after twelve months expire proceedings cease to lie.  So that the moneylender who is drawing upon the ignorance of his victim gets very short shrift under this Bill.  Section 10 deals with the provision in reference to bankruptcy. I do not think I need deal with those provisions in detail.  Section 11 deals with the rate of interest. It is very important to notice that as regards the rate of interest fixed by this Bill 20 per cent. is to be the standard.  In some cases the judge might find that 20 per cent. was too much.  In other cases it might be found that 20 per cent. was not sufficient, having regard to all the conditions.  This section only establishes a standard, a guide for the judge, an indication for him to follow. In England the rate of interest fixed was 48 per cent.  That was argued very vigorously against by some of the most important speakers on the Bill, and apparently it was a compromise.  Whatever we may think about the conditions in England, I do not think that the conditions of enterprise in Ireland would warrant or justify the fixing of a standard so high as that.  It appears from experience in the Bankruptcy Court that traders and industrialists who get loans of money from money-lenders at a high rate of interest are simply postponing the evil day.  In the long run it is found that it would have been much better for them had they gone into liquidation or taken the protection of the court before they had got these loans, because getting them simply sunk them deeper in debt.  It would have <Col N="693" /> been much better for them if they had not taken advantage of the high rate of interest charged, so that I do not think there will be any harm done, but, on the contrary, good, by discouraging people who are desperate in their minds and look for money at a high rate of interest. Then, of course, the moneylender trades a good deal on the vice of gambling.  He should not be encouraged by allowing him to get a high rate of interest for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out by Deputy Briscoe, it is a common trick with them to make charges and fines if there is a delay of a few days in paying interest on a loan.  These charges are all totted up and they increase the amount paid for the loan enormously.  That is forbidden by Section 12.  If they have been paid, they have to be counted and put in as a set-off against the money due.  Otherwise they are not recoverable. If the charges are made the borrower need not pay them. These fines are also treated in another place and have to be counted in as part of the rate of interest. That is dealt with in Section 15, the definition section.  It provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Interest&rdquo; does not include any sum lawfully charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act by a moneylender for or on account of costs, charges, or expenses, but save as aforesaid, includes any amount, by whatsoever name called, in excess of principal, paid or payable to a moneylender in consideration of or otherwise in respect of a loan.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the limitation of time.  I have referred to that already.  Instead of allowing the usual six years, it limits the time in which money can be recovered by the moneylender to twelve months only.  Then there are under that certain saving clauses which I need not go into at this stage.  If Deputies find on reading the Bill afterwards that there is any matter to be raised in the way of amendment that can be dealt with later.  The principle in Section 13 is the fixing of a time limit for payment to twelve <Col N="694" /> months after the last acknowledgment of the debt.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with pawnbrokers. Pawnbrokers are made an exception because they are naturally entitled to make certain charges for the keeping of goods, and so on.  The Act allows pawnbrokers in certain conditions to take out a licence as moneylenders.  If that is done, then, of course, in so far as they are moneylenders only, without getting goods they would come under the other provisions of the Act.  Section 15 deals with definitions.  If the Minister is going to give his approval to this Bill so that we can work it as an agreed measure, he may think it well to bring Section 15 up and make it Section 1, because in our Acts passed here we generally put the definitions at the beginning.</P>

      <P>Whichever the Minister likes.  Section 16 deals with information to be given on the assignment of a debt.  It is simply a set of provisions which deal with a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.  It lays down that if the moneylender sells his debt to somebody else who is not a moneylender, then he must tell him that the Act applies to this particulars debt and give him full information so that he will understand, and if he does not give that information he will be liable to certain severe penalties.  As well as that the assignee will be in a position to recover the money from the moneylender in case the Act is brought into force against him.  It really disposes of the Act of 1911, and in this Bill the whole thing is brought into proper position.  I desire to draw the attention of the House particularly to Section 18. This section provides that all rules made by the Minister for Justice under this Act shall be laid on the Table of the Dáil&mdash;the word &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; there should be &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;&mdash; when first made and shall lie thereon for a period of fourteen days, and during that period may be in whole or in part amended or rejected by a <Col N="695" /> Resolution of Dáil Eireann; and further that after the expiration of each subsequent twelve months the said rules shall be again laid upon the Table and be subject during a period of fourteen days to the said powers of amendment or rejection.</P>
      <P>We are not wedded to the wording of that section, but if we come to agreement perhaps we could get some way by which the Orders laid on the Table would be something more than perfunctory so that the assistance of the House would be there to help the Minister from time to time.  It is a very important problem upon which the House might very well be able to give assistance to the discussion of the rules from year to year.  I think that disposes of the principal sections. I will not go into the question of the First Schedule.  It provides a set of rules for accountancy, for dealing with loans which have been made in a vague manner, of calculating how much money paid off a loan is to be regarded as principal and how much is to be regarded as interest.</P>
      <P>It is really only a question of accountancy, and one would have to take an elaborate example and explain the figures in connection with that example, as it would be a waste of time to deal with it by way of abstract explanation.  I hope we will be able to deal with this Bill as we did with another Private Member's Bill.  The procedure as regards a Private Member's Bill is that after Second Reading it should go to a committee appointed by the House.  That would mean that the general time of the House would not be wasted.  The Bill could be dealt with in one of the committee rooms, as another Bill dealing with compulsory Irish for lawyers was dealt with, and dealt with very successfully. I hope we shall get assistance from the Government so that we shall be able to deal with this matter expeditiously.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say upon this Bill.  As the proposer and seconder pointed out, it is practically a verbatim <Col N="696" /> copy of the existing legislation in Great Britain.  I cannot say that I have made any intensive study of the question of moneylenders in this country, and I am not in a position to say that legislation in Great Britain is legislation which is most suited to this country.  It may or it may not be.  It is not my intention to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, and it is our intention to give the Bill the necessary imprimatur, if I may put it that way, by proposing the necessary Money Resolution. There are, of course, certain things in the Bill which will have to be drastically dealt with. For instance, I must frankly confess that though I spent a considerable time over Section 11, sub-section (1), I completely failed to understand it.  It might be put in another form later on which would make it clear.  The 48 per cent. is suddenly dropped from nowhere at the end of the section.  There may be other questions of that nature which would appear to the committee to require to be made clear. The Bill may require a considerable amount of amendment.  I heard Deputy Briscoe state that one of the great evils in this country was the fact that money-lenders walked from house to house making a personal canvass.  I see nothing in the Bill which stops a personal canvass. There is a prohibition of the sending out of circulars, but I do not see anything which prevents a personal canvass.</P>

      <P>It is with a feeling of dismay, almost akin to shame, but not in a unfriendly spirit, that I propose shortly to discuss this Bill.  I must confess that day by day the <Col N="697" /> mentality and principles of the chief Opposition Party are becoming to me more difficult to comprehend and more difficult to follow.  It is from amongst one of the sections of that group that this Bill emanates.  As I understand, the chief Opposition Party are agreed in their Opposition to the Treaty, but the Party itself are split up into different sections. There is one section whom it would not be relevant to this Bill to discuss, that is the section that say, while they are opposed to the Treaty still, if their party came into power they would not be such damned fools as to proclaim a republic.  The adjective is theirs and not mine.  I take it I would not be in order in discussing that section.  I take it also that I would not be in order in discussing the section of the chief Opposition Party which say that in the event I have mentioned they would be such damned fools.  There is a third and daily increasing section which I think I would be in order in discussing as relevant to this Bill. The leaders of that third section are Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Little. They have it as the Keynote of their principles that they are opposed to the Treaty, because they say this country is unfit and unable to legislate for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that with that mentality we find the two of them together cogging British statutes and turning them into Free State Bills? Deputy Little said this was a Bill which this House should approach in a careful and thoughtful way. How did he and Deputy Briscoe approach it?  Where was the care? Where was the thought in applying a British statute to Irish ideals and ways?  They copied it verbatim. Not as much as a word did they change, not a syllable, not a comma. They stand before the House two convicted plagiarists.  One would expect them at least to approach the Minister for Finance and ask him to use his well known influence with the British Privy Council so that the Bill would appear before us printed with the words &ldquo;by kind permission of the British Parliament.&rdquo;<Col N="698" /> But no, they will not do that and at present you have on the Order Paper from this section of the chief Opposition Party two Bills cogged from British statutes and cogged verbatim by this section of the chief Opposition Party who say that we are unable to legislate for ourselves.  While I am not opposed to the Second Reading of this Bill, I was never so surprised as I was by the doctrine that we are not able to draw up a Bill suitable for Irish conditions and present it to this House.  We have the shame of having it thrown in our faces that when we are getting a statute for this country we have to cog it from a British statute.</P>
    <P>We talk about keeping down expenses and making the work of the House lighter.  Would it not be easier if the brace of Deputies and their followers were to come together and bring in one statute and declare that all British statutes and Acts shall, except where the Dáil otherwise enacts, be applied forthwith to this country?  That is what they want to bring us to.  What does the Bill contain?  It contains, as I have already pointed out, nothing whatever that the English statute does not contain, not a word, syllable or comma.  I was shocked, I was horrified, to find that Deputy Little and Deputy Briscoe would put their names to the back of a Bill that contained not one single provision for the encouragement, protection or cultivation of the national language. We heard Deputy Little at great length a few months ago when he suggested that there should be no entrance into his own profession except for those who passed an examination in Irish.  Quite right. That is now the law of the land and we must bow to it.  But why not give the same soup to the moneylenders?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy move an amendment to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Wolfe Mr. Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be suggested that these moneylenders are to be registered without learning one word of the national language?  Perhaps then we will have Deputy Flinn, who is smiling, saying that money-lenders <Col N="699" /> are over twenty-one and that people over twenty-one cannot appreciate sound, and that as a result they could not learn Irish.  We will have a word to say with the Minister for Finance about that.  The Minister has in his locker several &ldquo;jackboots&rdquo; still to spare, and with the loan of one of the Minister's &ldquo;jackboots&rdquo; it will be easy enough to knock Irish into the moneylenders. I hope when Deputy Little comes to reply he will, at least, give an undertaking that when this Bill comes back on the Report Stage he will be prepared to insert an amendment making it compulsory upon every man seeking registration as a moneylender to show his proficiency in the national language.  If he had not been guilty of going to the British statute book and turning a British statute into a Free State Bill, he would never have been guilty of that glaring omission which, I am sure, he will look back upon with very great regret.  I think that Deputies Little and Briscoe did not follow the trend of public opinion.  That expression &ldquo;public opinion&rdquo; is not exactly mine.  I think the Minister for Local Government is the author of it.  I am afraid I did not follow it.  If the Deputies can follow it, they must know that no Bill of this sort will be received by this House unless it contains provisions for the preservation, cultivation and promulgation of the national language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seventeen sections and a schedule in this Bill.  What should it contain in order to get rid of the evil which exists in the Free State and which I am entirely at one with the proposer in thinking we ought to get rid of?  To bring this down to bedrock, what the Deputy wants is to have Section 7 slightly strengthened.  What is wanted is a section making it the law of this country that every promissory note or bill of exchange passed in respect of money or other securities shall contain, in English and in Irish if you wish, a plain statement showing the rate per centum per annum being charged for interest, with the <Col N="700" /> proviso that if that is not done the contract shall be void and also the consideration on which it is founded.  That was the idea in Section 7 of the Moneylenders Act, but, in order to suit conditions in this country, it might be suitably strengthened in order to carry out what Deputies Little and Briscoe have said and be in accordance with the ideas they put before the House. To give an illustration of what happens very often in practice: A man borrows £5 from a moneylender and passes a promissory note for £6 payable by six monthly instalments at the rate of £1 per month.  What is the rate per centum which he pays? How many people who sign a contract like that know the answer? How many Deputies will work it out within a few minutes or within half an hour?  How many can tell you straight off, except perhaps Deputy Briscoe, who I know is quicker than most people, that the man is paying something like 100 per centum per annum?  They do not know it.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that in order to turn this English statute into a Bill suitable to Irish ideals and ways, we ought to strengthen Section 7 and put it down plainly and clearly that the rate per centum must be shown in every transaction and that every transaction in which it is not shown shall be void as regards the contract and also the consideration for the contract, so that the money is lost to the moneylender if he does not comply.  If we do that, we will meet the evil.  Let us not de discussing whether it should be 15, 20 or 25 per centum.  Let the man who borrows the money know what the rate of interest is&mdash;let it not be underhand.  The circumstances in England are very different from those in this country.  In this country you have people in the very remote parts, I am sorry to say even in my own constituency, dealing with some of these people from Northern Ireland, from Dublin, or from across the sea.  It is all nonsense to pretend that they know the circumstances of the transaction. <Col N="701" /> They do not know.  Some of them, of course, whether they know them or not, will enter into these improvident transactions, so that the legislature has to safeguard them and see that the contract is put before them in plain language and that they get notice of what they are doing.  If, after that, in the teeth of their own interests, they will enter into such a contract, then all we can say is that we have done everything possible to protect them. I am not unfriendly to the Bill, and look forward with keen interest to seeing the amendments which Deputy Little is already preparing providing for the preservation of the national language and also, I hope, for the strengthening of Section 7 in the way I suggest.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have not had the opportunity of hearing Deputy Little explaining the provisions of the Bill.  I want to say briefly on behalf of the Labour Party that we welcome the Bill as an effort to control the operations of the particular people with whom it deals.  In our opinion, it is a measure which is, in fact, overdue and so far from criticising Deputy Little and his colleagues in introducing it, as Deputy Wolfe did to some extent, I congratulate them on having introduced it.  I think it is a Bill that the Government should have introduced long ago.  I have no hesitation in saying that this is a much more useful form of legislation and work to do than some of the Bills and motions which we have discussed in the past in Private Members' time. That refers, I may say, to other Bills which have been introduced by Deputy Little.</P>
      <P>The general principle of the Bill is one about which there will be no dispute, I think, in this House and no difference of opinion.  There is no section in the community which suffers more under the operations of these particular people than the poorer classes in the country, and in the cities especially, and anything that the House can do to put limitations on their activities will be in the interests of the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> I was specially interested in the suggestion made by Deputy Jasper Wolfe of having the rate of per cent. made part of the transaction in each promissory note.  I think that suggestion might well be carried out even in the case of other money-lenders who are not exactly spoken of as moneylenders&mdash;the banks. People who borrow money from banks very often find it difficult to see what the rate of interest is upon the money they have borrowed.  I do not wish, at this stage, to say more than we are supporting the general principle of the Bill and we will examine the various sections carefully with a view to seeing if any amendment may be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. George Wolfe Mr. George Wolfe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. George Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the present law is not strong enough to control the class of people dealt with in this Bill it is a very good thing that this measure has been brought forward.  I do not think anybody could spend forty or fifty years in this world without seeing the disastrous results that have come upon many young people, and old ones too, from dealing with those people and, through ignorance on their own part, in not understanding what they were doing.  In England there was a tremendous lot of this some years ago and a great many unfortunate young men came to ruin through these moneylenders.  A great deal of credit is due to the late editor of &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; Mr. Labouchere, and his paper for the public work they did in bringing to the notice of people who were likely to be gulled by these sharps&mdash;that is the name they should be called in some cases &mdash;and bringing the result of dealing with these people to the knowledge of those who were ignorant of them, and got into difficulties through them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see, even if we have to copy a British statute, that we are going to have an Act put into force here that will control this traffic, so that anybody that is foolish enough to deal with this class of people will, at least, know what he is about.  The suggestion that the rate of interest should be <Col N="703" /> stated on the paper given to the victim is, I think, a very good suggestion. Certainly 20 per cent. is high enough.  If the maximum is 48 per cent. in England I am rather astonished that such a thing should be permitted.  But I suppose that moneylenders do lose occasionally. I suppose it is regarded as a risky business, and that people engaged in it must be allowed to charge a high rate of interest.  But there is no doubt it should be controlled, in the interests of weak and foolish people who have dealings with that class of people.  I am very glad that this Bill has been brought forward, and I am sorry that I have not read it as carefully as I should have done.  But I can understand from the explanations given by Deputy Little and Deputy Briscoe that there is a great deal in it that is capable of being made workable.  I am quite certain there is a necessity for it and I think it has been shown that there is.  If this Bill is strengthened it will have a very useful effect and will help and assist people who find themselves at their wit's end and grasp at anything to save them from destruction.  I think the discussion of this Bill will bring to the minds of many people the knowledge that it is dangerous to deal with this class of persons without knowing thoroughly what one is about, and the ins and outs of their methods. For all these reasons I am very glad to see that this Bill is brought forward. I hope it will be strengthened in Committee and passed into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I feel very gratified that the Bill has got such a favourable reception from all sides of the House, and although we had to submit to the unscrupulous banter of Deputy Jasper Wolfe about imitating English legislation I think it is inevitable that we will have to imitate English legislation for some time to come.  That has been done not only in this Bill but in many other cases, but no one took any notice of it in the other cases, whereas we have not merely to follow a British Act in this case but more <Col N="704" /> or less to adopt it verbatim in order that we would not make any drafting errors.  We have no expert draftsman at our disposal and therefore to avoid errors it was thought better, at the initial stage, to take the British Act as it is.  It is not correct for Deputy Jasper Wolfe to say that not a comma nor an iota in the British Act has been changed.  There have been some changes.  The rate per cent. is changed and that is a very vital element.  There is an additional section also in this Bill dealing with the conditions at present by which a moneylender who would be operating, say from Belfast where there is no Act, will be dealt with.  I hope in Committee Stage we will have the assistance of Deputy Wolfe when it becomes a question of dealing with these matters because some of them are very difficult to deal with, and especially this particular problem.  I am not satisfied with the drafting of this section as it is.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied to accept any amendment from Deputy Wolfe that will force Irish in upon anybody whether lender or borrower. If Deputy Wolfe will draft such a section I do not care how radical it may be he will have our co-operation.</P>

      <P>There are one or two other matters to which I would like to refer.  I quite agree with the Minister that we will have to deal explicitly with the tout.  Of course he can be dealt with in this way.  Very stringent rules can be made by the District Justice dealing with money-lenders from year to year.  For instance a man who would tout by sending agents from house to house, or from workshop to workshop, would, I imagine, at discreation of the Judge, be found not to be a fit and proper person to be a moneylender. In that way the matter could be dealt with.  But it is not always well to leave things to be dealt with at the discretion of anyone, and it might be well to put something into the Act explicitly forbidding touting <Col N="705" /> in that matter.  There is another kind of moneylending which is very insidious and in Donegal and other places is subject to great abuses.  That is what is known as credit auctions where money is lent under the cover either of the sale of land or cattle. I hope we will have somebody in the Committee who will propose an amendment to deal with this abuse. I have discussed the matter with people familiar with the abuse but, not being myself familiar with it I would prefer to have it dealt with by somebody who is.  The Committee I suppose will deal with these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  I have carried the Bill about in my pocket since its introduction and it has reached such a frayed state that I can scarcely read it at present.  It is a short and simple Bill.  Its subject is as it is set forth in the title:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act for the granting of powers to enable funds to be raised by means of sweepstakes and drawings of prizes for the support of public charitable hospitals and sanatoria in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its inception I had no part.  It originated with a Joint Committee of six or eight hospitals, the financial position of which was so precarious that they were threatened unless funds could be raised by some means in the near future.  I understand that the combined indebtedness of these six hospitals as far as overdrafts to the bank are concerned is not less than £60,000.  This Joint Committee finds that if it were desirable <Col N="706" /> funds could not be raised from the State.  Even if the State were offering to support the hospitals, I do not think I personally would agree to it.  There was no hope, at all events, when the Committee turned their attention to the charitable public, that the public could open their purse-strings more widely than they had done in the past, and I will refer later on to the extent to which the charitable public have been able to support the hospitals within the last few years.  This Committee, however, had before them the encouraging fact that in recent times one hospital had benefited to the extent of £25,000 and a second hospital to the extent of £10,000 by means of sweepstake schemes promoted on their behalf. The obvious course, therefore, for that Committee was to endeavour to make money by these means, the only means which seemed possible for them to adopt.  A scheme was drawn up.  It might be laid before the Minister for Justice for his approval or amendment or his rejection, whichever he considered necessary, but in order that the Minister for Justice would have the power to adopt any scheme it was necessary that the Oireachtas should empower him to do so by passing a measure on the lines indicated in this Bill.  Accordingly the Bill was drafted and placed in my hands with a view to introducing it and endeavouring to secure its passage through the Dáil.  As far as I am personally concerned, I have had nothing to do with the drawing up of the scheme or of the Bill.  The Bill was actually placed in my hands before I knew any proposal of such a sort had been adopted by these hospitals, and I may say at once if there had seemed to me any other method of securing financial aid for the poverty-stricken hospitals I should not have consented to bringing the measure before the Dáil.  I have no great desire to see the hospitals supported by means of sweepstakes, but I am driven to this position, that these hospitals which are involved have practically no other means by which they are to subsist unless a measure such as I am proposing tonight passes the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> As far as the Bill itself is concerned it is a short measure.  The first clause deals with power to hold sweepstakes or drawings of prizes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every such sweepstake or drawing of prizes shall be held carried on or conducted by a Committee to be appointed by the Board of such hospital or sanatorium and subject to a scheme drawn up by such Committee which shall be submitted to and subject to the approval of the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That leaves the onus of drawing up a scheme upon the Joint Committee of the hospitals which have agreed to enter into the scheme.  It will be necessary for the hospitals to show that they are in financial difficulties before they can expect to get into this scheme.  The board of one hospital or a number of hospitals are prepared to go in in order to formulate this scheme.  This scheme was drawn up by these hospitals that were in very great need of money.  There is no reason why under the Bill any number of hospitals, situated in any part of the country, should not themselves join together, form a scheme and lay the scheme before the Minister.  If he approves of the scheme it should be allowed to go on. In other words, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and the other cities are at liberty, after drafting a scheme, to lay it before the Minister, and may take advantage of this.  This is only a temporary measure.  This is not a permanent measure.  I want to lay stress upon that fact.  It is a temporary measure, and is entitled the Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  In that way the provisions of it are confined solely to sweepstakes relating to hospitals. The clause at the end says that the Bill is to remain in force until 1st July, 1933.  I do not know but that it would be advisable, perhaps, to extend it for another year, in case the experiment has not been sufficiently tried before then.</P>
    <P>The next thing I have to do is to show the necessity on the part of the hospitals that have joined in this <Col N="708" /> scheme.  I have before me a statement from the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street.  Their present overdraft is £1,916, practically £2,000.  The cost of running that hospital during 1929 was £6,413. I want to lay special stress upon the voluntary subscriptions, because people have said to me, &ldquo;Why do you not get people to put their hands in their pockets and support the hospitals?&rdquo;  This is a hospital which is doing a tremendous amount of good work.  I am told that it will probably have to close its doors, unless those in control are able to get money because a great deal of repairs have to be done.  They have nearly £2,000 of an overdraft, still the voluntary subscriptions, including special donations and a charity sermon amounted in 1929 to £463. Those who talk about another method of raising money for hospitals may at once exclude the particular method of trying to get money from the charitable public.  The next on the list is Jervis Street Hospital. The present overdraft amounts to £22,472, while the cost of running the hospital amounts to £9,264. Voluntary subscriptions, including special donations during 1927, came to £746; in 1928, £737; so that out of a total cost of roughly between £9,000 and £10,000 to run the hospital, they are only able to get between £700 and £800 in voluntary subscriptions from the charitable public.</P>
    <P>The next on the list is St. Mary's Open Air Hospital, Cappagh, Finglas, Co. Dublin.  They have a bank overdraft of £9,918 6s. 8d.  Their total debt is £20,918, so that they are in a bad way.  I have not as many details about this hospital as I have about the others.  Coming to the National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street we find that during 1928, 319 indoor patients were treated, and there was a great deal of outdoor work with ultra violet rays and radiographs.  The overdraft amounts to £6,823, or nearly £7,000. Lord Powerscourt, who was Chairman of the Hospital announced a few months ago that unless funds <Col N="709" /> were available this year the hospital would be closed, as they were not going to run it any longer unless some further support came along. St. Ultan's Hospital is a comparatively small one, and so new that one would hardly expect them to have an overdraft.  It amounts to £1,410. The number of patients was 286 during the month of June, 1929; 124 being treated free; 32 paid 2/6d. weekly; 113 paid sums varying from 3/- to 10/- weekly; and 17 paid £1 1s. 0d. weekly.  During the same period 5,873 babies were treated in the extern department, no charge being made for the service.  As far as this small hospital is concerned they want a good deal of money for things that are needed.  At present the overdraft in the bank is over £1,400.</P>
    <P>I come now to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, with which I am connected. The debit balance at the bank on 6th February was £9,384. No State grant was received by the hospital.  The number of patients during the year was 1,577, the number of patients admitted who paid nothing, 420, and the total number of patients treated at the outdoor dispensary during the year came to 28,874.  The subscriptions and donations here show a little better result than in the case of the others.  The subscriptions received from the charitable public during 1929 came to £2,081, but the total cost of running the hospital was roughly £10,000, so that only one-fifth of the total cost is supplied by the charitable public.  The amount received from bequests and legacies amounted to £1,132, and from patients able to pay, £3,297.  As a matter of fact, the hospital is at present being run at £1,000 of a loss yearly, and such a state of affairs cannot go on.  Help must be received or eventually the hospital must be closed.</P>
    <P>The Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwick Hospitals have an overdraft of £2,000.  I have a long statement about them which I need not go into now.  These hospitals are in a different position from some of the <Col N="710" /> others, because they are in receipt of a pretty large grant from the Government. They formerly received something like £7,500, but last year the grant was cut down, as far as I remember, to £5,000, so that the overdraft now amounts to £2,000.</P>
    <P>These are the chief points I have to deal with in regard to the necessity of raising money for these hospitals.  I think I have shown without any question that money is needed.  In 1923, when a previous Bill was introduced, a Select Committee was appointed with power to take evidence.  One of the things upon which they took evidence was to find out whether the hospitals were really in a state of want.  The Select Committee found without any question that the hospitals needed money very much.  Nothing was done at the time.  A second point was also inquired into, the expense of running sweepstakes.  The Committee came to the conclusion that the expense of running sweeps amounted roughly to anything from 36 to 40 per cent.  They had before them, and put on record the expenses of three sweeps that were run by the late Canon Nolan in County Antrim. Seeing that the figures were audited, the result is interesting.  The prize money amounted to £5,000, postage to £13,000, printing and stationery to £600, wages to £3,650, and advertising £205.</P>
    <P>The total cost of running the sweeps amounted to £31,171.  The tickets sold in three sweeps amounted to £84,163, leaving a total balance of practically £53,000, so that the promoters would have the benefit of that sum, which represented 63 per cent.  of the total, while the expenses represented 37 per cent.  As I said, the previous Select Committee that had power to take evidence when appointed by the Dáil in 1923, reported that roughly the expenses of any sweepstake must be round about that figure.  There is, I take it, no necessity at present to refer this Bill to a Committee for the purpose of making inquiries of that kind, because there is in existence the Report of the previous Committee.  So far as the <Col N="711" /> first point is concerned, namely, the necessitous position of the hospitals, I think I have dealt with that at sufficient length to convince everyone. If the Bill passes Second Reading, as I hope it will, any scheme drawn up by the Committee of the various hospitals which join in it must go before the Minister for Justice for his approval.  He will have power to say whether a proper percentage of the total sale of tickets is being allotted towards the expenses of maintaining hospitals. Furthermore, if the Bill passes Second Reading, it will automatically be referred to a Select Committee of eleven members appointed by the Selection Committee, who will have power to discuss the matter fully and to amend the Bill in any way that is considered necessary.  An opportunity will be given to place further restrictions in regard to any matter about which there is any doubt or suspicion, and to put amendments into the Bill which will remedy that. Again I say that the measure is a mere temporary one, and is more or less in the nature of an experiment. It has been stated that it is a mistake to be sending tickets out of the country to be sold in other countries. I have here some tickets from such places as Copenhagen, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Canada, Northern Ireland and England.  I see a receipt for £2 12s. 6d.</P>

      <P>No, it does not say.  I am much obliged to Deputy Flinn for calling my attention to the matter, because I see that in one of these sweeps there is sufficient in prize money to secure a prize to practically every second ticket, and everybody who buys two tickets is almost certain to get a prize.  I have the greatest confidence that the Dáil will support me in this Bill, but before concluding I desire to say that I want to stand in a white sheet and mention that on the last occasion, when a similar Bill was <Col N="712" /> before the House I voted against its Second Reading because we were told by the then Minister for Home Affairs, the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, that he thought it would be impossible to close all the loopholes to corruption and fraud. I said that although I knew the hospitals were in a bad way I could not consent to voting for a Bill concerning which there was any suggestion of fraud.  On this occasion I have spoken to the Minister for Justice, and I think that I am entitled to say that he does not take that view.  He is quite opposed to the measure, but he says that he is perfectly satisfied that if it passes, and if the scheme is drawn tightly enough it could be carried out without any fraud.  I understand that the matter of giving the Bill a Second Reading will be left to a free vote of the House, and though I am very averse to raising money in this particular way I see no other means by which it can be raised for our hospitals. Therefore I am doing a thing which I have no great desire to do.  I admit that quite freely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in seconding the motion that this Bill be given a Second Reading.  I think it may mean the development later on of sweepstakes on a much more elaborate scale.  I see no reason why we in the Free State cannot do what they have done in England. When they had a Stock Exchange sweep there last year about one million pound tickets were sold.  I have a cutting here which refers to the hospitals that benefited by that sweep.  It states that 500 hospitals and other charitable institutions figured in the amazing list of allocations to charity which the Stock Exchange Mutual Subscription Fund has published showing how they disbursed the sum of £100,000. Three hospitals received £5,000 each, and so on.  Five hundred different hospitals in London and other parts of England benefited by that sweep.  A very large proportion of that money came from Ireland, and fifty times more would have come from here if tickets could have been got.  I was pressed very <Col N="713" /> strongly by a large number of Deputies here to get them tickets.</P>
      <P>In other words, Irish money was used for subsidising these English hospitals.  I do not grudge it to them.  I am very glad they got it, but at the same time I consider that we should first subsidise Irish hospitals, which, Sir James Craig has pointed out, are in such a serious condition. I make no apology whatever for supporting the Bill.  There is opposition to the Bill on the ground that it is encouraging gambling, but the fact remains that if we had a sweep on similar lines to the Stock Exchange sweep in England, every one of the people who talk in that way would be quite sure to have a ticket.  Sweeps, if legalised, would bring a large amount of foreign capital into the Free State.  The vast majority of purchasers of sweep tickets are resident in other countries.  America, Canada and India have liberally subscribed to sweepstakes in this country, and I advocate legalising sweeps, as I said, on a much larger scale.  The majority of the hospitals are in debt, and the money provided in this way will serve a really useful purpose in putting our hospitals in a sound financial position.  A charitable lady in Westmeath made a donation of £1,600 to the Westmeath County Hospital. We devoted that to the purchase of the best <i>x</i>-ray apparatus in Great Britain.  It is only a person who is conversant with the work done by that apparatus who can understand what an extraordinary benefit it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that it is not only the Dublin hospitals which will benefit by this.  Every hospital in the Free State is going to benefit.  If hospitals which would not be able to provide such apparatus out of money provided by the ratepayers were able to provide a similar <i>x</i>-ray apparatus, I think it would certainly be a very great benefit.  I would like to see annual sweepstakes here similar to the Stock Exchange sweep.  We had better get away from this humbug because we have established in this country betting shops in every town and village.  I opposed that measure, <Col N="714" /> and I said at the time that it would lead to a decrease in big betting and to an increase in small betting.  It will be seen now that I was perfectly right.  I hope there will be no free vote on this Bill, because I believe there should be no vote.  It should be passed unanimously.  I hope that the members of the House will unanimously support the Bill and so come to the relief of those institutions which are doing such valuable work in the country in the interests of humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very easy matter upon which one can make up one's mind.  There is a great deal to be said in favour of this Bill.  It seems to be clear that the Dublin hospitals are not in a sound financial position for the most part and it seems clear that some method other than the present method of appealing to the charitable public must be discovered or an appeal must be made to the non-charitable public.  If charity is not strong enough in this country to fill the exchequers of these hospitals, it does seem likely that nothing else than an appeal to cupidity will do so.  I recognise that these hospitals are in a bad way.  I recognise that the hospitals are doing extremely good work and I recognise fully what a loss it would be to this country if these hospitals or any of them closed down.  I recognise that fully, but I have to look to another side of this question.  If this Bill were to be the be-all and the end-all of legislation of this class in the country I would support it, but it appears to me that this Bill is the thin end of a wedge and that if it be inserted, the thick end of the wedge will be driven in also, that if we permit, legalise and authorise a sweep in favour of hospitals we will also have to legalise sweeps in favour of various other charitable institutions.  We will have to, because, to my mind, there can be no distinction drawn between the two. If we legalise a sweep on the Grand National for a Dublin hospital, I do not see how we can refuse to legalise a sweep for the building of a church <Col N="715" /> if the promoters of the building of the church desire it.  There can be no distinction drawn, and then you will go on very much further. Again, you would find somebody who wished to build a school and who would ask to get a private Bill, likewise, for the building of a school by money subscribed by lottery. You would discover that there are already small sweepstakes running in this country, giving small prizes as a means of collecting funds for coursing clubs, golf clubs and for race meetings.  If you once permit sweepstakes to be held I, at any rate, cannot see where you can draw the line.  I cannot see how you could prevent sweepstakes being held for all purposes once you admit that the holding of any one sweepstake is lawful and justifiable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shaw stated that a sweepstake would do more damage than a betting shop.  That is perfectly correct, but if he admits that betting shops are bad, surely the way of getting over the evil is not by piling another evil on top of it.  If allowing bookmakers to have establishments open is bad, because it encourages gambling, surely if you add another method of gambling to it you are placing two evils where you had only one before.  I frankly confess I cannot follow that argument. As far as I am personally concerned, though I think it is a matter upon which persons' opinions may very reasonably differ&mdash;it is a matter upon which every member of the House should make up his own mind&mdash;while I fully recognise the strength of the case which can be made on behalf of the hospitals, if there is a division, for the grounds I have stated, I will go into the Lobby against this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not envisage the passing of this measure with any particular enthusiasm.  I take it, and I believe it is so, that on these benches there is a considerable difference of opinion on the matter also.  I do not know that there are many <Col N="716" /> amongst us who object very strongly to the principle of sweepstakes.  I do not think that there are many such, but there are some.  There is certainly a strong current of opinion against the opening of the door to the flood that is sure to follow in the way of sweepstakes.  We all realise that the position with regard to certain hospitals in the City of Dublin is serious.  Some of these hospitals have, for a great many years, done excellent work for all classes of citizens, and some of them, in particular, for the poor and the poorer of our citizens.  Therefore, from that point of view we would be loth to do anything that would not alone stop but that would delay any relief coming to these hospitals.</P>
      <P>We realise fully, I think, the principle that is at stake here with regard to this question of sweepstakes. It is letting down a barrier that does now exist.  To a certain extent, it exists in law at any rate, though I am afraid not in practice, and what we are doing or what we are asked to do for some of the hospitals in the City of Dublin to-day we may be asked to do, if this Bill is passed, for other institutions later on&mdash;institutions that call themselves equally charitable institutions. Therefore, the whole country will be flooded with people seeking to raise funds, possibly in most cases for excellent objects, but, nevertheless, funds will be sought to be raised by a system which is, in the minds of a great number of citizens, open to grave question.  That is our belief.  However, I think our Party are prepared to say that they will not, at any rate, oppose the Bill on certain conditions.  We have given the matter a good deal of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee of our Party has gone into it to consider this Bill in all its various aspects.  On that committee, there were people very strongly against the opening of the doors and some others pressing the point that the hospitals were in such a financial condition that they would have to close their doors, and the people who would suffer most would <Col N="717" /> be the poor.  That weighed considerably with our members.  In considering the position of these hospitals it was brought to our attention that there was in the running of them and in the conduct and management of them things, which in our opinion, ought to have been wiped out half a century ago.  It was mentioned, and to a certain extent I think it cannot be contradicted, that in some of those hospitals that are likely to avail of the privileges if this Bill becomes law, conditions are laid down with regard to the religion of the patients.  There are conditions that only certain patients and certain religious persuasions would be permitted.  In other hospitals there are conditions laid down with regard to their staffs.  Now, if the Bill becomes law these hospitals will get the help of all classes of citizens for their support.  We are of opinion that if those hospitals I have mentioned wish to avail of this privilege if it is given by this House, if they are going to be allowed to appeal in this way to the public at large for the necessary support to keep them in existence, where barriers of that kind against any class of citizens exist they should not be allowed to exist.  These barriers are a relic of bygone days and they should be a relic of bygone days.  We accordingly think that if such hospitals ask to be allowed to use this privilege that they ought to march with the times.</P>
    <P>We made out a number of headings, a number of conditions and these are that if this Bill gets a Second Reading here that it would be sent to a Committee of the House for examination, and we would make it a condition precedent to our support of the Bill that when it came back from the Committee that such conditions as exist that I have already referred to relating to sectarianism with regard to hospitals, should go.  Also, we would like that sweepstakes if permitted at all should be conducted under close Government supervision.  Another condition that was suggested to us and to which we are agreeable was <Col N="718" /> that over and above the actual outlay involved in carrying the sweepstake through, no fee or commission should be allowed to private individuals as promoters or organisers.</P>
    <P>We are not anxious that the privilege which is asked here should be used by individuals or organisations that have been in existence for years for the running of sweeps of this kind.  That would very likely open the road to their reaping the greater part of the profit.  It has been brought to our notice that in a number of sweeps that have been run in recent years by such organisers on a commission basis, that in the end, practically only 10 per cent. of the total receipts reached the charitable institutions concerned.  We do not think that that is good enough if such a privilege is going to be allowed to exist by law.</P>
    <P>Another condition that we suggest &mdash;and I do not think there can be any objection to it&mdash;is that an audited statement of the accounts of the sweepstakes should be submitted to the Minister for Justice and published in the daily Press, and that such hospitals as avail of the provisions of this Bill should publish annual statements of accounts and present such statements to the Government for inspection and audit.  The tickets issued in connection with the sweep should print the following particulars for the information of the public: The names of the hospitals participating in the sweepstake, the proportion of the net receipts to be allocated to the hospitals, the number of beds in each hospital allocated to paying and to non-paying patients respectively, and the number of beds subsidised by public authorities or associations. We know that particularly in regard to the hospitals that Deputy Sir James Craig mentioned that there would not be much difficulty in that matter.  There might not, in fact, be much difficulty with regard to the publication we ask for.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I know that in these hospitals&mdash;<Col N="719" /> Deputy Sir James Craig has given us figures in regard to some of them &mdash;a very big percentage of the beds are occupied by the very poor people who cannot afford to pay. The probability is that if these hospitals were able to get a greater measure of support arising out of sweeps, they would give a larger proportion of their beds to the poorest classes, so that I do not think there would be very great difficulty in agreeing to that on the Committee Stage.  There might be a difficulty about some of the other conditions that we will ask for, but we have decided that we must submit them.  We must make our support, whatever it be worth, conditional on the acceptance of the conditions I have mentioned.  I do not know if it would be possible, but the thing is worth some consideration before the Bill is finally accepted, to have the measure confined strictly to public charitable objects, and that there ought to be somewhere in the Bill a clause inserted giving the Minister for Justice power to define what public charities, in his opinion, are, and leaving it to him to say whether any particular object put before him could be described as a public charitable object to which this Bill would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right for this Bill, and I hope it does not go beyond it; but efforts will be made when we open the door to have it applying to other matters.  These <Col N="720" /> things should be borne in mind when we are dealing with this Bill in Committee. Hospitals are not opened every day, and sanatoria are not opened every day, but what might be described as public hospitals possibly could be opened by interested parties and it is just as well that we should safeguard ourselves with all the regulations we can put up, and do it in advance.</P>
      <P>We are not at all in love with the principle.  It is an unfortunate thing that hospitals doing such good work as most and perhaps all of them, but certainly some that I personally know of, are doing, should have to raise funds in this manner. It is unfortunate and regrettable but these are the facts and we have to face them.  We are told by responsible people that if we do not allow this Bill to pass, and if they are not given this privilege, they will have to close their doors.  It is a regrettable thing that a pistol can be put to your head in that way.  It has been suggested to some of those in control of the hospitals that they should try other methods, and they tell us that they have tried every possible method to raise the necessary funds.  Some of the hospitals, as Deputy Sir James Craig has said, are very heavily in debt and they do not know where to look for the money.  They have appealed to the charitable public over and over again and while some of them are satisfied that they got a generous response, the response is nothing approaching the necessity.  It would appear if we are to accept their word that this is the only way out for them.  Personally I dislike the idea of running sweepstakes on English races for anything in Ireland.  I do not object to races or to sweeps in principle, but I do object to the running of sweepstakes on English races.  If sweepstakes were run on Irish races my objection would not be so strong.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to an Irish horse winning an English race.  It is creditable that we can produce Irish horses that are able to beat horses in England.  That is all to our credit, but I do not like the idea of encouraging our people to be constantly reading papers that set their minds on foreign races, whether it is the Grand National or the Waterloo Cup or anything else of that sort.  I dislike it.  If they run their sweeps on Irish races part of my personal objection will disappear. I think it is not helpful to the country, and it is not helpful to the people from any point of view, intellectually, spiritually, economically, to be developing in that direction. It is a personal viewpoint, but I think it is a viewpoint that many people hold.</P>
      <P>One reason why I hesitate to vote is because I am told by some of those who have a good deal to do with sweeps and who know a good deal about them, that the majority of these sweeps will be run on the big English races.  That does not make the passage of this Bill appeal to me any more.  I do not know whether it is the intention to have a vote on this Bill to-night, but at any rate we intend to put forward the conditions I have mentioned, and we expect the greater part of them, in fact all of them, will find ready acceptance.  I am informed that they will be accepted generally.  If they are, then I think the majority, if not all, of our people will vote for the passage of the Bill.  If they are not accepted, then I am not sure that any of our members will vote for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not voice anybody's opinions but my own on this matter, because it is a matter on <Col N="722" /> which possibly we may all have different views.  I am going to support the Bill, especially because of the object for which it is promoted.  I want to say quite candidly and honestly that I am not opposed in principle to sweepstakes or to this particular method of raising money. I do not want to give any kind of half-hearted support to the measure or to pretend that I see something terribly wrong in this method of raising money and then go on to point out that because of the good purpose for which the Bill is promoted I am going to give it my support. I do not see that there is anything particularly wrong in raising money in this way when I consider that most of our revenue is raised on what I might call our human frailty.  Medical men tell us of the ill-effects that follow from indulgence in intoxicating liquor or even in the smoking of tobacco.  I am afraid that if all of us were suddenly to become non-drinkers and non-smokers the Minister for Finance would be faced with a problem that we could not help him to solve.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Finance, I am afraid, would never be equal to that task.  It is perhaps unfortunate that we have to raise money in this particular way.  But, supposing we all suddenly ceased to go to picture houses and other places of amusement, the National Exchequer would lose the substantial amount of money it is getting from amusement tax at present. I cannot see the difference in exploiting, if you like, the fairly universal desire of indulging in a little gamble&mdash;that human weakness or frailty&mdash;and other human frailties. Deputy O'Kelly stated that while at the moment sweepstakes were contrary to the law they were not contrary to the practice.  He admitted that the practice was there. The view that I have on the matter is this: that if the practice is there and in itself is not morally wrong, it is better that we should have the <Col N="723" /> law in consonance with the practice than have the law against the practice, winking, as it were, at the continuance of the practice.  Take the question of the Prohibition law in the United States, for instance. Those who know anything about the way it is carried out, especially in the great Eastern States, are aware that it has reduced not only that law, but others as well, to a farce.</P>
      <P>There is undoubtedly the danger of fraud in connection with the running of sweepstakes.  But, of course, there is the danger of fraud in connection with every form of business.  I do not know that there is any particular form of business free from it.  All our business people in the country are not such Simon Pures that they can afford to hold up their hands and say that if this barrier is let down and this door opened we will have all kinds of fraud.  We must take measures to protect people against fraud in this as well as in other matters.  I was taken with the suggestion of Deputy O'Kelly that there should be some form of Government control in regard to these sweepstakes.  That is a suggestion worthy of careful examination. We might even consider the question of raising money for other social purposes in this particular way.  It is done by the Governments of other States and has been referred to in this House before.  I am referring now to the method of raising money by the issue of premium bonds, with the Government regulating prizes, drawings, and so on.  I do not know that there is anything specially wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the case made out by Deputy Sir James Craig for this is a strong one on its merits. Everyone knows that these hospitals are doing very good work.  If anyone objects to the method which the Deputy has proposed for the raising of money for these hospitals, then I think it is up to that person to indicate some more practical method, some more moral method if one likes, of doing what is desired.  We have been told that voluntary subscriptions <Col N="724" /> are drying up.  I think that is a growing experience in the case of concerns or institutions dependent on voluntary subscriptions. It is becoming harder and harder to keep these concerns going.  There was a good deal, I think, in what Deputy O'Kelly said on the matter of running sweepstakes in connection with big English races.  I am thoroughly with the Deputy in that. The difficulty, I take it, of meeting that situation is that we have not so many interesting events in our own country that we could run sweepstakes on.  I suggest to Deputy Sir James Craig that we should not confine ourselves in the matter of these sweepstakes to races entirely.  For instance, we could have an interesting sweepstake on who is going to win the next general election.</P>

      <P>If we sent Deputy O'Kelly on an advertising mission we might get many tickets sold and in that way raise a great amount of money.  I think this is a measure that ought to commend itself to the House.  I can see nothing wrong in this particular method of raising money.  It may open the door to certain evils.  It may be that evils such as fraud would get connected with it.  As I have said, you find fraud connected with other kinds of business as well as with sweepstakes. I agree with the point made by Deputy O'Kelly with regard to preventing people from running these sweepstakes on a commission basis.  I do not think that should be allowed&mdash;farming these sweepstakes out to professional sweepstake runners who generally pocket most of the proceeds themselves. Measures are being taken in the Bill to provide that the Committee in charge of the sweepstake run under it will turn over the proceeds for the charitable purposes mentioned, with the exception of meeting the necessary expenses.  That is as it ought to be.  I intend to <Col N="725" /> support the second reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt whatever but that the hospitals in this country are deserving of every support they can get.  The method of raising money for them by means of voluntary subscriptions has, as has been admitted on all sides, been pushed to the utmost limits.  This Bill proposes to raise money for them in what seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate way.  There is not in this Bill, as some people imagine, a great temptation to gamble.  A ticket for a sweepstake is offered to a person.  There is no compulsion to buy.  It is much casier for people to buy a ticket on a sweepstake run on a race than, say, to back the fancy of that particular race.  The chances of winning are perhaps quite as good.  The law has made it very easy for people to gamble money on races all over the country and particularly in the city of Dublin.  The fact that sweepstakes are being run in aid of hospitals will, I suggest, offer no great inducement to people to gamble who would not otherwise do so.  For that reason, I think the Bill is deserving of every support it can get.  We would certainly like to see some conditions put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the elimination of any third party in the getting up of a sweepstake.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell and other speakers that we should not allow professional sweepstake runners to join together in getting up a sweep on a percentage basis.  The whole proceeds should be devoted to the specific object for which the sweep has been got up, and the work should be done by a voluntary committee.  I am sure that in a case like this plenty of volunteer workers would come forward, and I believe that opinion is shared by every Deputy in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to emphasise the work done by the hospitals in the city of Dublin and all over the country.  Speaking particularly about the Dublin hospitals, with which I <Col N="726" /> have been associated for a good many years, I can say it is a well-known fact that no Dublin hospital has ever turned from its doors any poor person in need of treatment, no matter what that person's creed might be. I would say that in particular of the maternity hospitals in this city.  No patient who ever entered the doors of the maternity hospital and needed treatment was ever turned away. There is no doubt whatever that every hospital in Dublin has faithfully adhered to that tradition.  I do not like the introduction into this debate of the question of religious tests.  I do not believe that such a thing as religious tests exists in any of the Dublin hospitals as far as patients are concerned, and no patient needing treatment will be turned away from any hospital in this city no matter what the religion of that patient is, but when vacancies arise on the staffs of the various hospitals we ought to consider the means for giving the positions in any side of the work to the best qualified applicant irrespective of the question of creed.  That rule should obtain in all hospitals in the city.  The suggestion has been made from these benches that that rule should obtain in the case of any hospital benefiting by a sweepstake legalised by this House.  A rule to that effect should be inserted in the charter of the hospitals.  The hospitals will not suffer and the country will benefit by the removal of any test that does exist, because the services of only the best men will be availed of when vacancies arise.</P>

      <P>This Bill, if passed, will only run until 1933, so that it will be only a temporary palliative, and permanent legislation will be required later on.  I suggest that in the meantime the Government should institute an inquiry into the matter, I do not know how far the inquiry already held went into the matter, but there are many anomalies in connection with the whole hospital system in this country.  There are anomalies as to charters and as to the methods by which appointments are made which are very humiliating <Col N="727" /> to the profession.  A professional man seeking a post in a hospital, no matter how distinguished his career, has to see a number of persons who by an antiquated charter have become patrons of the hospital, or are its governors&mdash;persons who do not live in Ireland sometimes, who are ignorant of the positions, and not competent to judge of the merits of the doctors.  That is a degrading system.  Appointments should be made on merit.  I suggest that before 1933 the Government should institute an inquiry into the present system, so that certain recommendations could be made and a national scheme could be adopted for all the hospitals that wish to partake in the privileges which the State would extend to them.  No hospital that preferred to remain outside the scheme would be forced in, but those who would come into the national scheme should conform to certain principles, one being that appointments would be made on the grounds of merit and no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that one hospital in Dublin, doing splendid work for the people and with a world-wide reputation, is in the position that the governor of it must not be a Catholic.  That is the Rotunda Hospital.  That it should be so is laughable, but it is true.  I am perfectly certain that to-day the governors of the hospital laugh at that provision.  With a little pressure from the public generally an anomaly like that would be removed, and nobody would be the worse for that.  I hope the President will give some idea as to whether he is willing to institute such an inquiry as I have suggested.  Two or three advantages would, I believe, result from such an inquiry.  First, these sweepstakes, instead of being permitted for the benefit of local hospitals, would become a national sweep run by the Government.  That would bring in a tremendous amount of money, and the money brought to the benefit of the hospitals in that way would be greatly in excess of what it would be under this Bill.  It <Col N="728" /> would be a sweep run by the Government, and it would prevent individuals trying to get up sweeps for other purposes.  It would not be a precedent for individual action. Then, a sweep of that kind might lead to some sort of organisation or co-operation between the hospitals, so that we could get the benefit of the very large amount of money that might be put at our disposal from the Carnegic Fund.  As this is only a temporary measure, I urge on the Government to institute a searching inquiry so that by the end of 1933 we can have legislation on larger lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that every Deputy is thoroughly sympathetic with this Bill.  Anybody listening to the very reasoned speech of Deputy Sir James Craig, in which he pointed out the expenses incurred in running each hospital and the insignificant income which each hospital enjoys, can only come to one conclusion: that something has got to be done if the hospitals are to be kept open.  Anybody familiar with the work of any of the hospitals to which he referred must feel sympathetic with the Bill.  Take Jervis Street Hospital, which has an overdraft of £22,000.  Has that hospital ever turned a patient away from its doors?  It is only when one gets away from this little island of ours, about which we hold sometimes a very poor opinion, that one realises how good are some of the services which are extended to the public here.  I remember many years ago in the city of Liverpool an accident occurring in my house and I ran out to get immediate surgical treatment for a child.  I was refused treatment at two different hospitals because the child was only of a certain age.  Could anybody imagine such a thing as that happening in Dublin? After all there are some advantages in our social systems here.  I believe that Dublin is miles ahead of Liverpool in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly pointed out that he was against professional promoters going into these things, and said <Col N="729" /> that sometimes only 10 per cent. of the proceeds found its way into the coffers of the charity for which the sweepstake was instituted.  If the Deputy had considered the statement that Deputy Sir James Craig made he would see that this money certainly does not go entirely into the pockets of the promoters.  Deputy Sir James Craig pointed out in connection with one sweepstake that £13,000 was spent upon stamps. Every penny of that went into the coffers of the State.  He also pointed out that £6,000 was spent upon printing.  The printing business in this city could do very well with an expenditure of £6,000.  Then he said that some £200 was spent on advertising. The Press of this city will not object to a nice little advertisement value for £200.  If we look at these things, we shall see that a great deal of this money will go into the pockets of the people themselves. The Deputy was careful to point out that any scheme carried out under the Bill must be submitted to the Minister for Justice and he informed us that the Minister was of opinion that he could devise ways and means by which the scheme could be carried out without any corruption.  If, as we have been told, tickets are pouring into the Free State from such places as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, England, etc., it is up to us to get some of our own back from these countries which are taking this money from us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice thinks the method suggested by Deputy Sir James Craig would not meet the case of the hospitals.  After all, half a loaf is better than no bread.  If the scheme were enlarged in the way that Deputy Little thought it might possibly be enlarged, it might become really huge thing that would possibly meet all the debts under which the hospitals labour at present. As to church promoters and others coming here and asking us to enlarge the scheme, after all it rests in the hands of the Dáil to say whether they will give permission or not.  If the Minister for Justice is of opinion that corruption can be <Col N="730" /> guarded against as far as the carrying out of a sweepstake is concerned, surely the great objection to the Bill is removed.  Nobody could fail to see that the position of the hospitals in Dublin is exceedingly serious, and I believe that if the money that would possibly come in under this scheme were available many meritorious cases which hospitals are obliged to turn away could receive treatment.  The scope of the Bill, as I have said, need not be enlarged; that rests with ourselves.</P>
    <P>As regards the point made by Deputy O'Kelly about running the sweepstakes upon Irish horses, a very great authority in the House informed me that some difficulty might occur in that respect.  He pointed out that the number of starters in Irish races, as a rule, was exceedingly small and he referred to the last Grand National where there were 66 starters.  I believe that where there is a large number of starters the people who succeed in obtaining a horse which starts win a fairly substantial prize.  If Deputy O'Kelly takes that into consideration it might make a change in his view as far as that particular aspect is concerned.  After all, what does it amount to?  This is for the help of the sick and needy.  It is often a question of choice as to the lesser of two evils.  If we allow the running of sweepstakes to relieve the sick and needy, that is a thing which the House need not be ashamed of.</P>

      <P>A few years ago this question of sweepstakes occupied the attention of the House and an Act was passed preventing them.  As a result of that there has been a feeling of thankfulness throughout the country.  People have in consequence been spared a lot of annoyance and of pestering.  I have no sympathy whatever with this particular Bill, although I have as much sympathy with the object it is proposed to serve as any person in this House or outside.</P>

      <P>That is what I was going to suggest.  I shall put my hand in my pocket and in the pocket of every other citizen in the State.  It is preferable, to my mind, that the State should be responsible for these hospitals and that all these charters should be removed&mdash;that their upkeep should be a State charge to which every citizen would contribute.  If it were made a State charge, every citizen would contribute indirectly and not only a small percentage of the citizens.  As it is a national benefit to have hospitals, all the people should support them.  Why should not every citizen support an object which is for the benefit of the citizens?  In that way, they would be contributing to one object only, and that is the upkeep of the hospitals.  They would not be carrying the promoters and the hangers-on on their back.  Many hospitals in the country are partly supported by local and State aid. Why should not the Dublin hospitals be placed on the same basis?  It would be much more edifying to have the hospitals supported by the State than by the system of having armies of people going round the country selling tickets and annoying people.  When the Bill prohibiting sweepstakes was before the Dáil we had a large number of people lobbying here, chasing the members here and there, and asking them to do this and that.  They had no sympathy with the hospitals, but only with the promoters and the people making a living out of it.  I for one am prepared to pay my share and other people should be prepared to pay their share.  It would be preferable to have the hospitals made a State charge rather than to get the money in this way.  What virtue has this system?  One would think that this was the only way of getting money for the hospitals.  I think it is the most objectionable way, and I am absolutely against it.</P>

If I had any doubts about the matter before I would have been strengthened in my resolve to support the Bill by <Col N="732" /> the remarks that have been made by Deputy Gorey.  I think if Deputy Gorey understood the position thoroughly he would not have fallen into the error that he has.

      <P>Promoters of sweepstakes to whom Deputy Gorey referred as lobbying Deputies some years ago will not if this Bill is passed, be able in the future to exploit the Irish public as they did before on behalf of such projects.  It is a regrettable feature of our social and national life to find that such charitable institutions as you have in Cork and Dublin have to resort to flag days and other methods of raising money for the upkeep of these institutions.  Another error into which some Deputies have fallen, and into which Deputy Gorey walked, is with regard to the funds subscribed to these institutions by the State.  It may be that there are certain hospitals in country districts that get grants from the Local Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sufficient knowledge of the big hospitals in Cork&mdash;the North City Infirmary and the South City Infirmary&mdash;to know that these two institutions get a grant from the County Council amounting to something like £1,400 a year.  It is a small sum, comparatively, in comparison with their very huge expenditure on hospital treatment.  There is, of course, the County Home, formerly known as the Cork Workhouse, to which patients are admitted free of charge. There is a small charge in connection with the North and South Infirmaries in Cork.  Many patients are self-supporting and pay anything from two to five guineas per week, but a number of patients are treated for nothing.  It might be possible, at a later stage, to have the principle underlying this Bill developed in another way as was suggested by Deputy O'Connell.  For <Col N="733" /> instance, there are other very deserving institutions in the country. Take the case of Child Welfare Leagues.  I know there is one very good Child Welfare League in Dublin doing very useful work.  There is one, also, in Cork doing very useful work and these Child Welfare Leagues have, from time to time, to have recourse to flag days and other means of obtaining revenue.  I think that is a very regrettable thing.  With Deputy Gorey I believe, ultimately, the State will have to handle this question.  I subscribe to the principle that every citizen in the State should be made to contribute directly or indirectly to these institutions. But we cannot afford to wait for the millennium.  This is one way of meeting the deficit on these institutions which are doing such wonderful and humane work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy O'Kelly about the tendency to hold these sweepstakes in connection with English races is one we cannot avoid for some time yet, until our people are able to institute an Irish Grand National or Lincoln or an event such as the Waterloo Cup.  We have, of course, an Irish Cup, but until we are able to make horse racing more attractive by way of big stakes and big entries we have to look to the other side.  By reason of the number of horses that are entered and the big stakes offered we will have to depend for the success of our sweeps on English racing. There is one phase of the Bill about which I am not quite so certain and it is this: I wonder will it have any effect upon the already dwindling number of voluntary subscribers?  Will it have an effect that many who support the Bill would not like it should have?  If it becomes known that you have the State giving its blessing to what may be termed lotteries, run in the interest of some of the hospitals which require this support&mdash;and there are only too many of them that require this support&mdash;will it have the effect of tightening up the purses of some of those hitherto generous people who were voluntary <Col N="734" /> subscribers to the hospitals?  It is my experience that once it is mooted that the State has, in any way directly or indirectly, associated in a project of this kind that is the result. It makes wealthy and generous people say they will find some other outlet for their charity as the hospitals to which they were subscribing are already covered by the State.  I would regret very much if that happened.  I hope it will not happen and I certainly do not want to prophesy evil.  So far as this Bill is concerned I shall give it my support. I believe these institutions require money and this is one of the readiest methods of getting money, and if it only does away with the frequent occurrence of flag days it will have done something.  Deputy Gorey spoke of people who pestered one with tickets for lotteries and all sorts of drawings.  I think there is no greater pest than the lady or the pushful young gentleman who comes along selling flags on flag days. Although one might have two or three of those flags already he is pressed to buy another.  I hope Deputy Gorey will derive some comfort from that, and I hope that the next time the Irish Cup comes on we will have a lottery or a sweep in connection with that Cup and I hope that Deputy Gorey may win it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the things that Deputy Gorey has said.  I do not agree, of course, with what he said about putting his hand into other people's pockets.  I do not know how he defends that policy, considering the charges he made against Deputies sitting on those benches some time ago.  Of course, people change.  I agree, however, with Deputy Gorey that these charitable institutions should be a charge upon the State.  I noticed, from the Estimates, that some of the Dublin hospitals are receiving grants from the State, and I should like to know why these grants are not extended to similar institutions.  All the charity seems to be given in Dublin, and I hope Cork Deputies will come together and see that this is rectified as soon as possible.  I think this <Col N="735" /> system of obtaining money by sweepstakes is a mistake.  The proposals in the Bill, in my opinion, infringe very much upon the rights of the Minister for Finance.  I look a little bit before me and I can see, in a few years, that when the Minister for Finance will have floated his last loan abroad he will have to rely upon sweepstakes for raising the next one.  I think this Bill, if passed, will partly knock his system out of tune. In a few years, of course, when he will have made the last loan abroad, he will have to find some other means of carrying on here.  He will not reduce salaries until the very last.  I think it is not right for Deputy Craig to step in here and infringe on the function of the Minister for Finance to raise revenue in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We were very much impressed with the statement Deputy Sir James Craig made about the condition of the Dublin hospitals. As far as I could take down the figures it would appear that they are in debt to the extent of well over £50,000, and viewed as a means of relief of the real trouble, and only in that respect, this Bill might be much more acceptable but that the passing of a measure such as this leaves it open to have other applications in the year 1933, when quite a number of the Deputies opposite will not be here to shoulder the burden. There is very little doubt about this Bill being of itself watertight, but even before 1933 other very laudable objects may be the subject of a further application on the part of certain persons interested to introduce another amendment of the Lottery Act in order to enable them to get along with the work.  I would not say that quite a number of the speeches here to-night will make this particular means of raising money a great success.  It is fairly obvious to anyone who has made a study of this subject that a great deal of the money goes in expenses, and that those who purchase tickets in the hope of winning prizes, if they read <Col N="736" /> the speeches, will know that their chances are much less rosy than ever before.  If I were to look for a body of persons to run a sweep, I think the Boards of the Dublin hospitals would be amongst the last of the persons I would seek to employ if I intended to make it a success.  Like other business, sweep-running is highly specialised.  While you may adopt a high and lofty tone and say you will have no professional persons engaged in it, my examination of the subject, as far as the last few years are concerned, shows me that if you want to make it a success you will have to get a person who knows all about it.  You might possibly gain by spending a little money in that particular direction, so that, as far as that section asking the boards to run them is concerned, I think they will keep as far away from it as possible if they are to make any money out of it.  I was surprised that among suggestions offered we could not have had a condition that, associated with the prizes, there might be articles of Irish manufacture, say, furniture, Irish carpets, silver, or something of that sort in very considerable amounts.  We could have them shown on exhibition here in Dublin to let the people see the value of them, and could give an alternative of money in lieu of the furniture, silver, and so on if the winner so desired.  The provision of Art Union drawings was instituted originally with a view to enabling such prizes of considerable amounts to be offered and to be legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly mentioned other conditions which he thought would be necessary to insert in this Bill before it could be finally accepted. I never heard, I must say, in connection with any of the Dublin hospitals that there was a refusal on the part of any of them to take in persons by reason of their particular religion.  I never heard it and I think the case made by Deputy Little would have come with very much more force from some other side of the House than from that side in connection with the appointment to a professional position by <Col N="737" /> the boards of the hospitals.  We have an Act here in operation for some years in which the one distinguishing characteristic is merit, and Deputies opposite brought in a Bill within the last couple of years asking that three persons of merit be nominated for a position.  I am quite sure that the Dublin hospitals have the same kind of principle.  I think the best person should be appointed. I think the case would come better from a person who is wedded to the appointment of the best qualified person in respect of any appointment throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I would like to let the Deputies know that this Bill is not a Government Bill.  A Bill <Col N="738" /> is being brought in by a private member.  It is a Private Member's Bill and there is an open vote to be taken on it.  Deputies opposite have put their own questions to us in connection with conditions and so on and I really thought that they regarded it as a Government measure It is not.  As far as I know members of the Government are opposed to this measure, not as I said against this particular Bill but rather because it makes it more difficult to withstand in future any amendment of the Lottery Act and because one of the principal objections we had to those sweeps being run here was the fact that we were not satisfied with the standing and so on of the persons who were rather anxious to run sweeps in this country.  There is no earthly reason why a dozen different laudable objects might not be put forward here during the next couple of years in order to get in on the sweepstake of 1932 or 1933 as the case may be.  I do not think there is anything in the objection that was made to sweepstakes being on English races.  It has so happened that English races are particularly attractive for more reasons than one.  There is a general ambition on the part of persons to own the winner of the Grand National. More horses enter here in respect of this than of any other race.  It is a great feat of endurance.  There is splendid horsemanship and excellent horseflesh, and anything there is in it as far as advertisement is concerned this country has got it, for the period during which I have lived anyway and for a considerable time before it.  The same might be said with regard to other big races over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenses in connection with these sweepstakes are very heavy. While the percentage the hospitals will get will be very small it will be a fairly big sum.  It is rather a pity some other means could not be found for raising money for the hospitals, but I do not at all agree with the suggestion that has been put forward that we should have State hospitals.  I think much better service can be done for the country <Col N="739" /> voluntarily than by the State.  I think there can be no possible cause of complaint as to the services rendered by these hospitals over a long period.  The fact that they have been in existence so long without any great claim being made on the public for support is a remarkable tribute to the manner in which they have been conducted, as well as to the capable management that has distinguished them.</P>
    <P>I cannot promise the inquiry into hospital work which Deputy Little wanted.  The last Commission of Inquiry took place about 1851, 1852, 1853 or 1854.  Unfortunately, some of the friends of the Deputies opposite burned two books I had in connection with that matter during the trouble, but one of the things I learned in the course of the evidence I read was, that the first hospital formed in Dublin was somewhere in St. Thomas Street about the 12th century.  Although the city was very small then the hospital had accommodation for something like seventy beds.  The most notable and the grandest characteristic of the hospitals of this country is that they have been mainly supported by voluntary and charitable subscriptions. I would be sorry to see them lose that character.  It is a remarkable tribute to this country and to the professional men and women engaged in them.  No one can complain of the services they render.  As I said the objection is not quite so much to this Bill as to the danger that is likely to flow from its passage. I propose to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is generally admitted that the Dublin hospitals do excellent work, and it must be borne in mind that the work they do is of a national character.  They are not exactly Dublin hospitals, seeing that they do the nation's work and receive poor patients from all over the country.  The President has paid a tribute to these hospitals, but he hesitated to endorse the Bill now before the House, the object of which is simply to enable these hospitals to <Col N="740" /> carry on their good work.  The fact is, if they do not get the relief that this Bill purports to give them, they will have to close.  They are very much in debt and have reached the limit of their resources.  It is all very well to speak of the charitable public and what they would do. While the charitable public had the money to give they gave it, but they no longer have it.  Let us face the plain issue that voting against this Bill now means voting to close up the hospitals.  If Deputies vote against the Bill, and if the Government supporters vote against it, they ought to be ready to come in and put down money so that the hospitals may carry on their good work.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to speak about the Bill, if passed, creating an awkward precedent.  I cannot conceive any subject that would provide such an excuse for the passing of a Bill similar to this as the case made to-night.  I appeal to every member of the House to support the Bill, and I ask Deputies to remember that by voting against it they are denying the poor people the treatment that has been given in these hospitals, because the hospitals cannot continue to find money in any other way.  It has been said that there are objections to betting on the Derby and the Grand National. I do not share that objection. I am not a betting man, but there is no year that I would not like to have a bet on the Grand National, as the President said, if only for the reputation it has made for Irish horses.  I also put on a little on the Derby.  I generally lose, but it would be a great consolation to me to lose my bet in these sweepstakes knowing that I was serving the hospitals, and knowing that my contribution meant that it would help to keep up these hospitals for the benefit of the poor.</P>

This was not, as he admitted himself, a Party measure, yet the greater part of his speech dealt, not with the Dublin hospitals, but with an attempt to defend the Local Appointments Commission, which some recent appointments made by that body, at any rate, have brought into disrepute in this country.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to continue on that line.  As Deputy O'Kelly has pointed out there is admittedly a great doubt as to the wisdom of this measure on the part of those who sit on these Benches, but we are faced with this dilemma &mdash;a dilemma which Deputy Hennessy has put&mdash;that unless something is done the hospitals must close down.  We are not aware that the Government has any intention of dealing with these hospitals; we are not aware that they have resources with which to deal with them, and therefore, so far as I am concerned I am prepared to vote for the Second Reading of the measure, in the hope that in the interval certain safeguards will be produced which will enable us to help to carry the Bill through.  There is nothing morally wrong in promoting sweepstakes, just as there is nothing morally wrong in betting or drinking, but it is an undoubted fact that there are dangers that the gambling spirit can be carried to excess, even in the promoting of sweepstakes like these, and that in opening the door to further promotions you will be, from the point of view of the people of this country, running very grave risks.  I take it that is the reason why sweepstakes have been hitherto prohibited in this country, or, at <Col N="742" /> least, have been regulated more or less by connivance, so that they cannot assume undue proportions or make undue demands on the savings of the people by offering prizes which would stimulate more than a mere desire to contribute to the sweepstakes for charitable or other sentimental purposes.  This Bill, I take it, proposes to do away with that regulation straight away.  There will be no limit, I presume, to the prizes which might be offered by the promoters of sweepstakes which, if the Bill goes through, will be legalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the great appeal then will be more to the cupidity of those who buy the tickets rather than to their sentiment or charity. Since these very special facilities are proposed under the Bill to be given to certain organisations it is, from our point of view, essential that as far as possible we should secure at the outset, by the actual provisions of the Bill itself, that they will not be abused.  It is for that reason that we suggest that some sort of State supervision should be exercised over the conduct of sweepstakes.  It is for that reason that we suggest that, over and above the actual outlay involved by the organisation, no fee should be paid to the promoters or organisers of such sweepstakes.  It may be that in order to secure certain specialised assistance something might be paid, but there should be a very definite limit as to the amount to be paid in that way, either for special information or for special skill necessary to make such sweepstakes successful.  We must be met on that point before there can be any possibility of our supporting the Bill after it leaves the Committee.  As well as that, we think that the people who subscribe to sweepstakes should know where their money is going, and for that reason we want to see an audited statement of accounts submitted to the Minister for Justice, or some other responsible Minister, and published in the Press. Furthermore, we are giving the hospitals a very special privilege, though the House refused to concede this privilege some years ago, and we say that, since this privilege <Col N="743" /> is going to be given, those who are going to participate in it must at least exhibit a policy more in keeping with the year 1930 than with the days of the penal laws.  There must be neither religious nor political discrimination exercised by those hospitals in their work, either in regard to the staff or to their patients.</P>
    <P>Again, since the public are going to be appealed to in this way, we think that the public ought to have in their possession such information as will enable them to determine for themselves whether the hospitals concerned require their funds to be supplemented in this way, as I do not think that every hospital in Dublin is in the parlous position mentioned by Deputy Sir James Craig.  Some of them may be quite able to carry on, but, even under this Bill, those which are in a sound financial position could organise sweepstakes in order to swell their already sufficient funds.  Therefore, no hospital should participate under this Bill unless it was prepared to publish an audited statement of accounts and to submit it to the Government, though the Government need not necessarily exercise that privilege.  Furthermore, we think that on the back of the tickets the names of the hospitals participating and the amount of money to be allocated to each should be printed for the information of the public. Again, we ought to know to what extent the hospitals provide for the really necessitous and destitute poor, and, therefore, we suggest that among other items of information to be furnished by the promoters there should be a statement as to the number of beds in each hospital allocated respectively to paying and non-paying patients, and the number of beds subsidised by public associations and public authorities.  These are conditions which we hope that the promoters of this measure will see their way to accept and, if they do, I think they will get a volume of support from members of this Party.  If, however, they do not agree to do so, I for one will be compelled to vote against the Bill on Report State.  I <Col N="744" /> think that the conditions which we suggest are reasonable, and are conditions which should be afforded in the public interest in view of the very special facilities asked for under the Bill.</P>

So far as I can gather from the speeches during this discussion, the Bill is going to be largely supported, and I hope that it will pass. Second Reading without a division. I do not intend at this stage to go into many of the criticisms made about the Bill, but I want to say, in regard to the criticisms made by Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy MacEntee, that they concern matters which should quite fairly and justly be brought before the Committee.  I cannot for the moment say that I am prepared to accept all of them, because I have not considered them, but I think that most of them are quite fair.  I do not know, however, whether some of them are not too trivial to be put into an Act of Parliament, but they are, no doubt, worthy of the consideration of the Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrowley" hpid="Mr. J. Crowley Mr. J. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question of the Minister for Justice to-day. The question was: &ldquo;Whether the Gárda Síochána authorities received any complaint relative to the arrest and alleged ill-treatment of Martin and Michael Hayes of Mountcoal, Listowel, on 19th December last, and, if so, what action has been, or will be, taken to deal with the person or persons against whom such complaints have been made.&rdquo;  The Minister replied as follows: &ldquo;The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part of the question the solicitors for the complainants who were in communication with the local Gárda Síochána Officer were informed on 20th ultimo that the complaints had been considered and it was not proposed to take any action in the matter.&rdquo;  As I considered that answer to be very unsatisfactory, I asked for leave to bring the matter up on the Motion for the Adjournment.  As there is not much time in which to do so I would like to relate the facts, but before I do so I want to make it perfectly plain that I yield to nobody in my admiration of that splendid force, the Gárda Síochána.  I believe that there is no police force in the world superior to them in zeal, efficiency and courtesy and in perhaps what is more important still, sympathy with the public.  The extraordinarily high standard which they have reached within a few years is most amazing and affords the utmost gratification to all of us, <Col N="746" /> as Irishmen.  But, of course, in any considerable body of men one is bound to find a few undesirables. Some, clad in a little authority, forget that they are the servants of the public and act as village tyrants; others, who have naturally vicious tendencies, exploit them on persons whom they believe incapable of resistance or of effective retaliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inevitable that men of such temperament should take as their exemplars that notorious force which they replaced, the &ldquo;Black and Tans&rdquo; and that they should faithfully follow their routine of midnight raids, terrorisation and indiscriminate shooting, especially in rural areas.  Others, zealous for early promotion, adopt a practice said to be of trans-oceanic origin, the &ldquo;third degree,&rdquo; in cases wherein evidence of crime is sought.  I am sure that everyone here will agree that this splendid force is well rid of such men, and that it is the duty of all good citizens to make public their misconduct, and of the Government rigorously to avoid any semblance of granting to any members of this force, who break the law, protection or treatment preferential to that accorded to the ordinary civilian.  I submit that such is not the attitude of the Ministry of Justice, which appears to be more concerned with the reputation of this force than with the elementary rights of the subject.  What are the facts as we know them? They are as follows:&mdash;Martin Hayes and Michael Hayes live with their father and mother, both of advanced years, with their brother Jeremiah and sister, Kate, in a lonely cottage at Dromclough about five miles from Listowel.  All the members of the family are peaceful and hardworking and bear excellent characters. Martin served in the National Army for nearly seven years from April, 1922, with character on discharge &ldquo;very good.&rdquo;  At about 1.30 a.m. on the morning of 19th December last, old Mrs. Hayes was awakened by hearing knocking and kicking at the door.  She looked out and saw a motor car pulled up and a number of men at her door.  She <Col N="747" /> asked who were there and the reply was given &ldquo;Open the door.&rdquo;  After a short time she opened the door and four men came in.  They refused to say who they were or what they wanted.  They asked for her sons and told them to dress.  They refused to allow a lamp to be lighted but put flash lamps to the faces of the three sons.  The daughter lit a candle and identified one of the men, who all appeared to be in plain clothes, as Sergeant H. of Listowel.  He was identified also by Michael and Jeremiah.  These men ordered the three sons to go outside and to get into the waiting motor car, but first took Michael Hayes away down the road, one walking in front, one on each side, and one, who waved a revolver over Hayes' shoulder, behind.  One said: &ldquo;Do not shoot him here.&rdquo;  Michael Hayes looked around and was immediately punched, kicked and knocked into the hedge where he was throttled, interrogated and punched.  One of the men put a revolver to his forehead and fired a shot over his head.  They used vile language and threatened him with a grave.  Michael Hayes addressed the Sergent by name and asked what he was going to do to him. The Sergeant said to the others to leave him alone, that he would tell. On Michael's return to the car Martin was brought about 200 yards down the road and about 100 yards into a field, where he was knocked down, beaten and kicked, and told that a grave was waiting for him, if you please.  A shot was fired over his head.</P>
    <P>On 20th December last Martin Hayes came to me and complained of the ill-treatment he had received from the Guards.  I advised him to see a solicitor.  He did so, and the solicitor wrote to the Superintendent of the Guards at Listowel.  That was on 21st December.  A reply was received from the Superintendent on 28th December.  The reply reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Re alleged assault on Jeremiah, Martin and Michael Hayes, Dromclough, <Col N="748" /> Listowel, on 19/12/1929.</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant and having reference to above.  I have carefully investigated this complaint regarding the conduct of a member of the Gárda Síochána on date and at hour mentioned and, so far, I have found nothing to justify the statements made to you by the the above-named.  I am further inquiring into the allegations made against a member of the Force, and, on completion of my investigation I shall again write to you on the subject.</P>

    <P>Solicitors, William Street,</P>
    <P>Listowel.</P>
    <P>Some time about the middle of January the Chief Superintendent at Tralee called to the home of the Hayes family together with the Superintendent at Listowel, and took statements.  He then made an extraordinary remark for an official who is supposed to conduct an impartial inquiry.  I will tell you about that later.  The solicitor for the Hayes brothers was not warned of this visit nor invited to attend.</P>
    <P>On 20th January, the Superintendent, Listowel, wrote as follows to the solicitors:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>Referring to your letter of 21st December, 1929, re above, and my acknowledgement dated 28th December, 1929, I now wish to inform you that I have completed my investigation of this case.  During my investigation particular attention was directed to the fact that a member of the Gárda is alleged to have taken part in what has been described to you as an aggravated assault, etc.  As a result of my investigations I have ascertained that the party who called at the house of the Hayes family were all members of the Gárda who were then investigating a shooting which took place in the locality at 7 p.m. on the night of <Col N="749" /> the 18th December, 1929.  I have taken statements from each member separately and I can find nothing to substantiate the allegations made by you, and in view of this I am not proceeding further in the matter.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Faithfully yours,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Jno. Kelly,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Superintendent.</P>
    <P>That was on the 20th January, 1930.  On that night two men, Buckley and Fiaherty, were brought into Listowel as prisoners.  It was freely rumoured that one of them was badly beaten but that the matter was settled by the intervention of an ex-Justice of the Peace with the assistance of something else.</P>

      <P>Oh, very well, sir. Now, I think it would be a monstrous thing if, as this sergeant has boasted, he is to be defended by the State in a case of this kind, and, I submit, that to require these young men to undertake a criminal prosecution at their own cost and in face of the opposition of the State, is a denial of justice which, I am sure, this House will not condone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards the letter of 28th December last, you will notice that the Superintendent of the Guards at Listowel wrote to the solicitor acting for the Hayes brothers and made a statement that he investigated the complaint made regarding the conduct of a member of the Gardá Síochána on the date and at the hour mentioned, and he says that, &ldquo;So far, I have found nothing to justify the statements made to you by the above-named.  I am further inquiring into the allegations made against a member of the force, and on completion of my investigation I shall again write to you on the subject.&rdquo; The Minister might not be aware that at the date of that letter, the 28th December, no member of the Hayes family had been asked for, or had given, any statement relative to these complaints.  The Superintendent does not say what was the <Col N="750" /> nature and extent of the &ldquo;careful Investigations,&rdquo; and who are the persons on whose examination or evidence he based this statement that &ldquo;I have found nothing to justify the statement made to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know that a further letter, dated 20th January last, was received by the solicitors from Superintendent Kelly, wherein he stated that &ldquo;I have completed my investigation of this case,&rdquo; and wherein he admits that the party who called at the house of the Hayes family were all members of the Garda, and that he had taken statements from each member separately, and that he could find nothing to substantiate the allegations made, and that in view of this he was not proceeding further in the matter. Now, that Superintendent was the officer in charge of the parties operating in this district.  Here is a case where serious allegations have been made of a raid on a lonely house at about 1.30 in the morning, allegations of threats, intimidation and assault, of dragging two respectable young men down the road and into the fields, of firing shots over their heads.  You have here a Superintendent of Guards in charge of and, I presume, responsible for the actions of these parties of Guards, who apparently thinks he has the power to close the matter and to acquit himself and his subordinates by saying: &ldquo;As a result of my inquiry, and as a result of statements taken from each member of the party, I find no substantiation for these allegations and I am not proceeding further in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether a Chief Superintendent of Guards, accompanied by the Superintendent in question, visited the house of the Hayes family about the middle of January and took statements from the mother, father, three brothers and a sister, and whether the solicitor acting for the complainants who had been in correspondence with the Superintendent since 21st December, was invited to be present? I know he was not invited to be present.  Now, I want to refer the Minister to columns 890 and 891 of <Col N="751" /> the Official Debates for 6th November last, wherein the Minister defines an inquiry as &ldquo;an inquiry in which a man will give evidence upon oath and at which he will be subject to cross-examination,&rdquo; and, further, &ldquo;an open inquiry is the very essence of an inquiry.&rdquo;  Will the Minister indicate any stage of the investigations which have been made so far in this case wherein his definition has been respected by the Civic Guards?  Will he say whether the statements taken from the Hayes family do not disclose a prima facia case in support of this allegation?  I ask the Minister if he is aware that the members of this family allege that the Chief Superintendent remarked when the mother of the family had stated that she had not heard any shots on the morning of the 19th December, whereas the daughter and the three sons stated that they had&mdash;that the Superintendent remarked that the mother was &ldquo;an honest witness anyway.&rdquo;  If this be true, is it not obvious that the investigation by the Chief Superintendent was of about the same value as the inquiry held by the Superintendent into his own responsibility and that of his subordinates?  Is the Minister aware that these are most respectable and law-abiding people and that Martin Hayes served for nearly seven years in the National Army with the character on discharge &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; and whether he considers that allegations made by respectable people of this type should be disregarded while the ex parte statements obtained in secret of men who would be liable to severe punishment if they admitted guilt are taken as conclusive?  Does the Minister suggest that no assaults were committed on these men because there were no marks on their heads or bodies, does he maintain that shots could not have been fired over their heads because they did not sustain bullet wounds?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that Martin Hayes alleges that about three weeks ago he was requested to settle this case and that while the matter <Col N="752" /> was being discussed the Sergeant of the Gárda, who has been identified as one of the assailants, walked up and down outside the door, conveying the impression that he was waiting to be called in?  Is the Minister aware that I was approached on 3rd inst., and asked to get this case settled, that the intermediary who said he had seen this Sergeant took my message that an apology was essential and returned saying that the Sergeant said that I &ldquo;could do my best,&rdquo; as the State would defend him?  I ask the Minister whether he considers that attempts to square Hayes and myself are consistent with the finding of the Superintendent that he could see no justification for the statements made by complainants?  I will refer the Minister to his answer on 6th November last, as reported in column 894 of the Official Debates, in which he said &ldquo;when a charge is made against the Guards the proper course is to hold a disciplinary inquiry, where the charge can be properly and fully dealt with.&rdquo;  I also refer him to his answer on column 892 on the same date in which he said, &ldquo;there has been an inquiry, and the matter is closed.  I am not going to put these men on a second trial.&rdquo;  May I take it that if a Guard commits an offence for which a civilian would be prosecuted by the State, that the proper procedure is that the Guard is merely subject to a disciplinary inquiry and that such inquiry closes the matter and that the Guard will not, whether found guilty or not at such an inquiry, be brought to trial in the ordinary criminal courts?  Will the Minister submit to the House the statements which were obtained from the Hayes family?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy gave us a very interesting and very eloquent speech, a good deal of it exordium.  It was carefully and eloquently phrased.  He then came down to make assertions about facts. I do not intend to follow him through his introductory rhetoric; I will simply deal with as many of his facts as I can deal with, in the <Col N="753" /> not very extended period of time at my disposal.  In the first place Hayes brought a charge against a Sergeant and a Guard.  The Deputy has exceeded anything that Hayes has done, because he has brought a charge not only against the Sergeant and the Guard, but also against the Superintendent and the Chief Superintendent. He made the astonishing statement that the Superintendent would be responsible for anything which the Guards under him did, and that he would be liable to punishment for anything that the Guards serving under him did.  Anything more inaccurate than that it is impossible to imagine.  It is the duty of the Superintendent to keep discipline amongst the men under him, and, far from being punished if he detects breaches of discipline and reports them, it is regarded as being good work on his part.  If these men had misconducted themselves upon this particular night it would be more to the advantage than to the disadvantage of the Superintendent to see that they were dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Superintendent investigated these matters.  Charges were made that two Guards, a Sergeant and a Detective Officer, fired shots.  As a matter of fact there had been firing into a house in that neighbourhood and that was being investigated.  As Deputies will understand, it had to be investigated there and then; it had to be investigated, so to speak, hot foot.  Guards from various stations were collected together and under the general command of the Superintendent they divided so as to visit certain houses from which either information might be got or which might contain the persons who had actually perpetrated this firing outrage.  The Superintendent is in a position to know that of all the Guards under him that night only the Detective Officer had a revolver. The Sergeant was in uniform and he does not carry a revolver and had not a revolver on that night.  That is within the knowledge of the Superintendent. Also he knows the number of rounds which the Detective Officer who had a revolver was furnished with.  He <Col N="754" /> knows the number of rounds he had when he went out and he knows the number of rounds he had when he came back.  It is rather difficult to understand how a man can start out with a certain number of rounds, fire two shots, and come back with the same number of rounds.</P>
    <P>These people have made charges that shots were fired above their heads, that assaults were made upon them.  They made long statements which I have here but I cannot go through them now.  In the long and very full statements from the whole lot of them they give an account of being knocked down, put in a ditch and half throttled and all that sort of stuff.  There is a statement made by their own mother to the effect that when they returned to the house they had no marks of violence upon them and she did not notice any mud upon their clothes.  That is their mother's evidence.  Now, this happened on 19th December last.  There and then these men placed themselves in the hands of a firm of solicitors.  Their being in the hands of a firm of solicitors, it was open to them to take whatever course they liked.  They are advised by the solicitors, the courts are open to them, and it is for them if they like to take out a summons. If they wish they can take civil proceedings.  The courts are open to them as they are open to everybody else.  They have got, moreover, solicitors to advise them; but I find that the Deputy here seems to consider himself a better adviser than the solicitors and he proceeds to take the matter out of the solicitors' hands.  I prefer to come to the conclusion that the case is a very, very bad case which has lain in solicitors' hands for two months and which has not eventuated in some form of legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on further to say something as to whether there was to be any difference in the treatment of Guards and the treatment of the ordinary public.  If there is an ordinary case of assault it is for the individual who has been assaulted to take out a summons and bring proceedings. <Col N="755" /> That is the ordinary procedure, and if these Hayes' have been assaulted they have that procedure ready for them.  On the files before me it is rather difficult for me to deal with the matter, because if there are subsequent proceedings it is rather difficult for me, as Deputies will understand, to express a personal opinion.  I do say, however, that on the statements before me, which are statements taken from these people, I do not see any reason why any abnormal step should be taken, and why these people should not be left to their ordinary remedy. They were, undoubtedly, taken out of their father's house, and they were taken out in order that they might be interrogated.  It is perfectly plain that it is the correct thing for the Guards to do.  A crime has been committed and it is necessary to get information on the matter.  It is impossible to interrogate two or three persons together. It is perfectly obvious that if one heard a story told by the other he would stick to it.  When investigating a thing of that nature it becomes perfectly obvious that statements must be taken separately.  The Guards brought these persons out of the house and they simply took their statements.  The Hayes' seem to have <Col N="756" /> been annoyed and, having been annoyed at being taken out of their house in order that statements might be got from them, they proceeded to paint a picture in very lurid colours. Having painted it in lurid colours, they succeeded in getting an advocate in the Deputy who brought up this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
